145	147	Are we the first?
150	152	Are we the first to arrive here?
193	195	Is the interpreter with you?
197	201	I'm not a professional interpreter. My occupation is cartography.
202	203	I'm a mapmaker.
204	207	Can you translate French into English and English into French?
207	210	Yes, I explained to the team leader at Villa Hermosa.
210	212	I'm just a little taken by surprise.
213	216	-Etes-vous Monsieur Loglin? -Laughlin, oui.
216	217	Oh, Laughlin. Pardon.
238	241	They're all there! All of them!
253	255	Check for landing marks!
280	283	Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers off the engine blocks!
287	290	M-447148!
290	294	W-445529!
295	298	Number 445529, check!

305	307	Tell me something. What's happening here?
308	310	-lt's flight number 1 9! -1 9 what?
310	314	lt's that training mission from the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.
314	317	They were doing target runs on an old hulk.
317	320	Who flies crates like these anymore?
320	325	No one! These planes were reported missing in 1 945.
330	332	But it looks brand-new!
336	338	Where's the pilot?
339	341	l don't understand!
342	344	Where's the crew?!
348	351	How the hell did it get here?!
383	385	He says this guy's local.
385	388	He was here last night. He saw it happen.
410	412	Sunburn?
428	431	He says the sun came out last night.
432	435	He says it sang to him.
471	473	Ernie, keep an eye on that point-out.
473	475	He's on 1 22.5.
476	477	l'll be right back.
479	482	lndianapolis Center, you have any traffic forAirEast 31?
484	486	Air East 31 , negative.
486	491	The only traffic l have is a TWA L-1 01 1 in your 6:00 position...
491	493	...range 1 5 miles...
494	497	...and an Allegheny DC-9 in your 1 2:00 position, 50 miles.
498	501	Stand by. l'll take a look at broadband, over.
501	505	AirEast 31 has traffic 2:00, slightly above and descending.
505	507	Air East 31 , roger.
507	510	l have a primary target about that position now.
510	512	l have no known traffic.
512	514	Stand by, l'll check low, over.
515	517	Check and see if they know who it is.
517	519	Center, AirEast 31.
519	521	The traffic's not lower than us.
521	525	He's 1:00 now, still above me and descending.
525	528	Air East 31 , can you say aircraft type?
529	533	Negative, Center, no distinct outline.
534	537	To tell you the truth, the target is ratherbrilliant.
537	541	lt has the brightest anti-collision lights l think l've everseen.
541	543	Alternating white to red.
544	546	The colors are striking.
546	549	Center, this is TWA 517.
549	552	Traffic now looks like extra-bright landing lights.
553	556	l thoughtAirEast had his landing lights on.
557	559	lt could be a satellite.
559	562	l have a primary target now in your 1 0:00 position...
562	563	...five miles, over.
563	565	Affirmative, 31.
565	569	The traffic is proceeding northeast. No altitude readout.
569	572	Roger, Center. lt doesn't appear he'll be a problem.
572	576	He's going to descend about 1500 feet below me.
576	577	Wait a second!
578	579	Stand by, one.
580	582	Okay, Center, AirEast 31. The traffic has turned.
583	586	He's heading formy windshield. We're turning immediately.
588	590	Descend and maintain flight level 31 0.
590	592	Break Allegheny, turn right 30 degrees.
592	597	Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing and see what they're testing up there.
597	601	Do you have test operations in restricted area 2508?
602	603	AirEast 31, roger.
603	607	The traffic is luminous and exhibiting non-ballistic motion.
608	610	Roger. Continue descent at your discretion.
611	613	Okay, Center. Descent atpilot's discretion is approved.
614	617	The traffic is approaching head-on, ultra-bright and really moving.
617	621	And right by us! Right now! Now that was really close.
621	624	AirEast 31 is out of340....
624	626	Ask if they want to report officially.
627	630	TWA 51 7, do you want to report a UFO? Over.
635	638	TWA 51 7, do you want to report a UFO? Over.
641	644	Negative. We don't want to report.
644	647	Air East 31 , do you wish to report a UFO? Over.
649	651	Negative. We don't want to report one either.
652	656	Air East 31 , do you wish to file a report of any kind? Over.
657	659	l wouldn't know what kind ofreport to file, Center.
660	662	Air East 31 , me neither.
662	664	l'll try to track traffic to destination, over.
832	833	Barry?
844	845	Honey?
861	863	Barry!
883	886	Dad, do myproblems forme.
887	891	l don't have to do your problems for you. You do your problems for you.
891	895	That's why l graduated, so l don't have to do problems.
896	898	l don't understand these fractions.
898	902	All right. What's one-third of 60?
902	904	That's a fraction. l don't understand it.
905	906	All right, look.
906	908	Let's say...
909	912	...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.
913	917	And one-third is across this switch here.
920	922	And now another train is coming.
926	929	How far do you have to move this boxcar off the track...
929	932	...so that the other train doesn't smash it?
932	935	Quickly, Brad, there are thousands of lives at stake.
936	937	Brad, any answer.
940	942	Remember last weekend...
942	946	...you promised everybody a movie this weekend?
948	949	Honey?
952	955	And you also promised Goofy Golf.
961	964	Roy, what is all this stuff on my table?
965	967	l thought l told you this was for my stuff.
967	969	l mean, you can have that table.
970	971	l don't want this on my table.
971	973	This can cause tetanus!
974	976	-What is this?! -You know what's playing?
977	979	Pinocchio! The kids have never seen Pinocchio.
980	982	You guys have never seen it. You'll love it.
982	984	l don't believe this.
984	988	Who wants to go see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?
989	991	-How old are you? -Eight.
991	993	-You want to be 9? -Yeah.
993	995	Then you're gonna see Pinocchio tomorrow night.
997	999	That's a wonderful way to win over your children.
999	1003	l'm not serious. l'm just saying that l grew up with Pinocchio.
1003	1006	And if kids are still kids, they're gonna eat it up.
1009	1011	Okay, l'm wrong. l'm Wrong Roy, all right?
1011	1015	Toby! You are close to death! Come out here!
1020	1025	l'll give you your choice. l'm not gonna be biased in any way.
1025	1029	You can either play Goofy Golf, which means a lot of waiting and pushing...
1030	1032	...or you can see Pinocchio...
1032	1036	...which is a lot of furry animals and magic and a wonderful time.
1037	1038	-Now, let's vote. -Golf!
1039	1040	All right, everybody to bed!
1041	1045	No way! Dad said we could finish watching The Ten Commandments!
1046	1048	Roy, that movie is four hours long.
1048	1051	l told them they'd watch only five commandments.
1051	1053	Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
1053	1056	We got a big problem. l need your old man in the field.
1056	1058	Roy can't drive at night without me.
1058	1061	We're experiencing an overall outage!
1061	1064	Wait, l can't-- Honey!
1064	1068	Jiminy Cricket. lt's Earl on the phone.
1073	1077	Neary. Get into your truck and report to line N in Tolono.
1078	1082	We're losing poweracross the grid. Has the outage hityou yet?
1094	1095	Hey! Lights!
1121	1124	Barry!
1146	1148	Help! l'm lost.
1151	1154	You're gonna cough up a little Tolono, right?
1154	1157	Cough up Tolono on lnterstate Highway 90.
1157	1160	A little familiar landmark of some sort.
1160	1163	-Cornbread Road, south of 20. -Cornbread?
1164	1165	Powermust have been restored.
1165	1169	Couple hundred neighbors think it's Saturday night.
1169	1170	Dispatch, this is 411.
1170	1173	Do you want me to disregard that Tolono call?
1176	1178	You're in the middle of the road, jackass!
1179	1182	Can you tell me where Cornbread is? Turkey!
1210	1213	834...834.... F-27.
1215	1218	M-Mary-1 0 through M-Mary-1 2. Okay.
1226	1230	Stoppage in the single circuits will lead you right to nowhere.
1233	1234	M-Mary-1 0.
1301	1302	Oh, shit!
1415	1417	What do you guys got out there?
1417	1419	l don't believe this!
1420	1422	My God! lt's as big as a house!
1424	1425	Shaped like a barn.
1427	1429	This is absolutely crazy.
1434	1437	Just off the Telemark Expressway and east toward Harper Valley.
1507	1508	No!
1508	1510	Watch out!
1515	1517	Oh, my God! Lady!
1518	1520	Are you okay? l'm sorry.
1520	1524	l didn't see him. He was in the middle of the road.
1526	1528	Hello! Here!
1528	1529	What's the matter with you?
1531	1532	Barry, come back here!
1565	1566	lce cream!
1588	1590	This is nuts.
1633	1635	Wait a minute!
1636	1638	What are you guys doing? Hey!
1638	1641	That's Ohio! That's a quarter!
1646	1650	Jesus, look at those suckers. They're glued to the road!
1697	1699	Honey, wake up!
1700	1703	Ronnie, wake up! You're not gonna believe what l saw!
1703	1705	Don't! Not now.
1705	1708	No, listen! l never would have believed it!
1708	1711	There was this-- ln the cab there was this whole--
1711	1713	lt went-- lt was-- There was a red whoosh that--
1715	1717	Roy.
1717	1718	lke called you.
1719	1721	And McGovern.
1721	1723	They want you to call. They couldn't reach you.
1724	1725	l turned the radio off.
1725	1728	Don't do that. The phone rang off the hook.
1728	1731	lt woke Sylvia up two times already. You'd better call them.
1732	1735	You know those pictures in National Geographic, the aurora borealis?
1735	1738	This is better than that. Come on!
1738	1740	Come on, Ronnie, get up.
1740	1742	-What's wrong? -Nothing. l don't know.
1742	1745	-Get up! -ls it an accident?
1745	1748	lt's not an accident. You wanted out of the house, right?
1748	1750	Not at 4:00 in the morning.
1750	1753	Ronnie, l need you to see something with me.
1754	1755	lt's really important.
1756	1758	Okay. All right. What about the kids?
1758	1760	The kids! l'll get the kids.
1761	1763	Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.
1763	1765	Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.
1766	1767	lt's better than Goofy Golf!
1772	1774	l'm going as fast as l can!
1775	1776	Come on.
1780	1781	Hi, Mrs. Harris.
1782	1783	Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.
1784	1785	There better be a good reason for this...
1786	1787	...because it doesn't make sense!
1789	1792	All right, Roy, l really think you've proved your point.
1796	1798	You're sunburned. Look at you.
1804	1806	Honey, what is that?
1811	1813	Roy, what did it look like?
1814	1816	lt was like an ice-cream cone.
1818	1820	What flavor?
1820	1821	Orange.
1822	1825	lt was orange. lt wasn't like an ice-cream cone.
1825	1827	lt was more like a shell.
1827	1829	Like a taco?
1829	1834	Was it like one of those Sara Lee moon-shaped cookies?
1834	1836	Those crescent cookies?
1845	1848	Don't you think l'm taking this really well?
1851	1855	l remember coming to places like this just to look at each other.
1860	1861	Snuggle.
2007	2011	l don't believe it. l don't believe it!
2011	2013	l don't believe it.
2013	2014	lt's the Cotopaxi.
2014	2017	-Why is it here? -Beats the shit out of me.
2052	2054	ls this the bathroom?
2072	2075	This is not your toy to play with every time l turn around.
2076	2077	He looks like a 50l50 Bar.
2078	2081	All right, out of this house. All of you. Out of my house.
2082	2084	l'm sorry, but you're not to play with this!
2084	2087	Get out while l clean up your mess!
2087	2089	Thank you very much.
2107	2110	l found this overnight tanning stuff.
2110	2114	l want you to spray it on half your face, so it's all one color.
2114	2117	lt makes my face look yellow. What does this remind you of?
2118	2120	Then we'll tell everybody you fell asleep...
2120	2122	...under the sun lamp on your right side.
2122	2124	What for?
2125	2128	Dad, can l ask you a question?
2128	2129	Are they for real?
2130	2131	That's what for.
2131	2133	No, they are not for real.
2133	2135	Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?
2136	2137	Ronnie, don't tell him that.
2137	2141	Don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about.
2141	2145	lf l can't talk about it, how will l know what's going on?
2146	2147	What?
2147	2148	Mom, l believe in them.
2149	2150	l believe in them too.
2151	2152	No, you don't.
2152	2154	Dad says we do.
2154	2156	No, he does not.
2157	2158	Do you, Roy?
2159	2163	All l want to do is know what's going on.
2163	2166	Nothing's going on! lt's just one of those things.
2166	2168	Which things? Which things?
2169	2171	-l don't want to hear about this. -This is very important!
2172	2175	l won't let it lay here. l'm gonna call somebody!
2175	2177	l'm not listening. l'm not listening.
2177	2180	l saw something last night that l can't explain.
2182	2184	l saw something last night l can't explain.
2186	2189	l'm going out there again tonight.
2191	2192	No, you're not.
2193	2194	Yes, l am.
2195	2196	No, you're not.
2196	2197	Yes, l am.
2200	2201	No, you're not.
2202	2203	Do they live on the moon?
2203	2207	They got bases there so at night they can come through your window.
2208	2211	This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it!
2211	2214	-You came through my window last. -You hurt me!
2214	2217	-You took all my covers. -Roy's not like that.
2217	2220	He loves his work. Don't say that!
2220	2222	What did he do? He was with us all night!
2222	2224	l won't have to go tonight.
2224	2227	He is not like that at all!
2227	2229	Stop yelling at me!
2230	2232	Can't you tell him about this?
2232	2233	Hello?
2234	2235	l can't believe it.
2236	2237	Roy...
2237	2239	...you got fired.
2240	2242	They didn't even want to talk to you.
2317	2319	Where were the sounds coming from?
2345	2349	Where did these sounds come from? Tell us, please.
2376	2378	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
2382	2386	l beg your pardon, but my English is not good too.
2389	2391	l want to share with you now...
2391	2394	...the breakthrough that happened in lndia.
2395	2398	We think it means something.
2399	2402	We think it is important.
2402	2407	To help you learn, l am using the hand sign created by Zoltan Kodaly.
2409	2414	Kodaly developed these signs to teach music to deaf children.
2509	2510	Hello?
2511	2512	Hi.
2512	2515	Hi, how are you? You came here too?
2515	2517	Yes. Jillian Guiler.
2517	2519	Roy Neary. Sorry about what happened.
2519	2522	-Good night! -What?
2524	2526	Look at you.
2529	2531	You got the same burn.
2532	2535	Yeah, but it's better on you. You got it all over at least.
2536	2538	l gotta tan the other side tonight.
2539	2541	How's the kid? l'm really sorry.
2541	2543	l'll be right back.
2543	2545	Raise your head a bit and give me a smile.
2546	2549	He's a little young for a record, don't you think?
2569	2570	Weird.
2572	2577	l know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road...
2578	2579	...l've been seeing this shape.
2582	2585	ln shaving cream and pillows....
2597	2599	Damn it, l know this! l know what this is.
2607	2609	This means something.
2615	2617	This is important.
2618	2619	Here they come!
2619	2621	Get the camera!
2621	2623	Out of the northwest!
2638	2641	lt's like Halloween for grownups.
2643	2644	Trick or treat.
2675	2676	Wait a minute!
2730	2731	The patterns are:
2731	2734	-We received two 1 5-minute broadcasts. -Non-random signals?
2735	2738	1 04 rapid pulses. After a five-second interval, 40 pulses.
2738	2741	Another five-second break, and 30 pulses.
2741	2743	60 seconds of silence, then a new set of numbers.
2746	2748	40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.
2748	2750	-1 04 rapid pulses. -Lord!
2751	2754	Wait 60 seconds and the whole doggone thing repeats.
2755	2758	-Where are the signals from? -The neighborhood.
2758	2760	Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.
2760	2762	Well within the plane of the ecliptic.
2762	2767	Are these non-random signals here, 40, 36, 1 0, in response to that?
2767	2771	They should be. We've sent this combination out for weeks.
2771	2774	All we're getting back are numbers.
2779	2782	This could mean the lndia sounds reached a dead end.
2783	2784	They don't mean a thing.
2784	2786	There's so much we don't know.
2786	2789	How about where the signals originate?
2792	2793	Excuse me.
2796	2798	What letter is 1 04?
2800	2801	Excuse me.
2805	2808	Before l got paid to speak French...
2811	2812	...l used to read maps.
2815	2817	This first number is a longitude.
2823	2824	Two sets of three numbers.
2824	2827	Degrees, minutes and seconds.
2827	2832	The first number has three digits, and the last two are below 60.
2833	2836	lt's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky.
2837	2840	These have to be Earth coordinates.
2840	2842	There's a globe in the office.
2845	2847	This is what we need.
2847	2849	Maybe there's a release pin underneath here.
2850	2853	That's a $2500 globe! What are you doing?
2870	2874	All right, everybody, quiet down! Hold it down!
2879	2881	The antenna. How dumb!
2881	2883	-Which way's it pointing? -Northeast.
2883	2885	That's Wyoming.
2892	2894	We'll need a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
2894	2896	l want it to the square yard.
2896	2900	The Army has a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.
3011	3013	Toys!
3014	3016	Toys!
3093	3095	Oh, my God!
3124	3126	You can come and play now.
3126	3128	You can come and play now.
3133	3136	Come in through the door.
3138	3141	One...two...three....
3151	3154	Mom, look! The sun's here!
3159	3161	Oh, my God!
3199	3201	Go away!
3225	3227	Clean everything up!
3243	3245	-Mom, let me listen! -Wait a minute!
3263	3264	Mom, look!
3273	3275	Come in through the door.
3297	3299	Barry!
3347	3349	Let's get in touch with the forest service...
3349	3353	...or we'll end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic.
3353	3357	And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming.
3364	3366	lf this mission is fully developed...
3367	3372	...l get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.
3373	3375	Your flight will be at 20:00 hours.
3375	3379	We have a limo that'll take you to the heliport now.
3380	3383	And transportation will be provided on the other end.
3386	3389	-l like the flash flood idea. -Where will you get the water?
3390	3394	We'll tell them one of the reservoirs is going to burst.
3395	3397	There's not enough water in those reservoirs!
3397	3400	Wait! Contaminated water affects people, crops, animals.
3400	3402	Disease.
3402	3405	-Yeah, epidemic. -What kind of disease?
3405	3406	A plague epidemic.
3406	3408	Nobody will believe a plague.
3409	3411	-Anthrax. -Ranching country.
3411	3413	There are a lot of sheep in the hills.
3413	3415	Good, l like that.
3415	3418	-lt'll create a panic. -But it may not evacuate everybody.
3418	3421	There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.
3423	3427	l need something so scary it'll clear 300 square miles...
3428	3430	...of every living Christian soul.
3462	3463	Help yourself.
3466	3471	l hate these potatoes. There's a dead fly in my potatoes.
3471	3472	lt's okay.
3579	3581	Well, l guess you've noticed...
3582	3586	...something is a little strange with Dad.
3589	3591	lt's okay, though.
3593	3595	l'm still Dad.
3600	3604	l can't describe it, what l'm feeling...
3604	3607	...and what l'm thinking.
3609	3612	This means something.
3613	3615	This is important.
3626	3628	That's not right.
3632	3633	lt's not right.
3635	3637	That's not right.
3666	3667	What is it?
3669	3671	What is it?!
3679	3680	lt's not fair.
3686	3687	Tell me.
3717	3719	Open the door, please.
3720	3721	please.
3724	3726	Open this door!
3726	3728	Open this door!
3757	3760	l don't think l know what's happening to me.
3766	3770	Look, Roy. What it is, is family therapy.
3770	3773	l mean, we all go. We all talk.
3773	3777	No one is singled out. Maybe it's not your fault anyway.
3778	3780	lt's waterproof. lt still works.
3781	3782	promise me you'll go!
3783	3786	You crybaby! You crybaby!
3786	3788	-You crybaby! -Get out of here!
3788	3789	Get out!
3790	3791	Come on, you guys.
3792	3794	You crybaby!
3794	3796	-Be quiet! -Stop it!
3796	3798	l don't understand it!
3798	3800	-Neither do l. -Get out!
3801	3803	Go to your room and close the door.
3806	3807	-Ronnie? -Yes.
3808	3812	l'm really scared. l want you to help me.
3812	3815	All this bullshit! lt's turning this house upside down!
3816	3818	l just hate you! That's why!
3818	3819	No!
3820	3823	Hold me. put your arms around me. lt'll really help me.
3824	3825	lt'll really help me.
3825	3828	Listen! Listen! Don't you see what's happening?
3828	3830	None of our friends call us anymore!
3830	3833	You're out of work! You don't care!
3833	3836	You're ruining us! You're ruining us!
3836	3838	-Ronnie, just hold on. -No!
3839	3840	Hold on.
3848	3851	Ronnie, open the door now. Come on.
3886	3889	Well, what do you know? lt's disintegrated.
3892	3896	Happy birthday, you thing from another world, you.
3896	3898	Thank you!
3905	3907	Well, l guess he's had enough.
3910	3912	Are you going to yell at me?
3929	3930	Everything's fine.
3941	3943	All this stuff is coming down.
3948	3950	lt's all gonna be like it was.
3959	3964	That's the last straw! Now l use my secret weapon!
3988	3990	-Where we going? -Where we going?
3991	3992	-Where are we going? -Just get in the car.
3992	3995	-Where are we going? -Quietly, quickly, get in.
3996	3997	Get in there, Toby.
3997	3998	Quickly.
4002	4004	-Dad needs some more help! -Lock the doors!
4004	4006	Dad needs some more help!
4006	4008	Quiet! Just lock the doors.
4008	4009	Roll up those windows.
4009	4012	Dad needs some more help!
4012	4014	Honey, where you going?
4014	4016	-What? -Where are you going?
4017	4019	Taking the kids to my sister's.
4021	4023	That's crazy. You're not even dressed.
4024	4025	What?
4025	4027	You said what?
4032	4033	Ronnie, wait!
4034	4036	Ronnie, hold it.
4037	4039	Will you hold it one minute?
4062	4063	Who is it, please?
4063	4068	lt's the mailman. There's a package forJulie Anderson.
4071	4074	You canjust leave it at the door!
4075	4080	l can't do that. l'm supposed to C.O.D.
4080	4081	And besides...
4082	4085	...you and l have to have a little talk...
4086	4087	...about Kim.
4107	4110	Like sands through the hourglass...
4110	4113	...so are the Days of Our Lives.
4115	4118	Here comes the king Here comes the big number one
4119	4123	Budweiserbeer The king is second to none
4123	4126	When you say Bud The king is coming
4126	4128	Let's hear the call
4128	4130	When you say Bud You've said it all
4131	4134	When you say Bud You've said it all
4139	4142	Good evening. At the top of the news tonight, a rail disaster.
4143	4145	At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...
4145	4148	...a trainload of dangerous chemical gas went off the rails...
4148	4151	...and forced the widest area evacuation...
4151	4155	...in the history of these controversial rail shipments.
4155	4158	Whenever you want me to. Tomorrow is fine.
4160	4162	l can do other things.
4163	4165	l'm trying to be.
4167	4167	Yes, l am.
4168	4171	The Army and National Guard are supervising the evacuation.
4171	4176	l am an adult, okay? Even though there's no such thing.
4176	4177	lt was a joke!
4178	4180	--the danger will be over within 72 hours.
4181	4184	Ronnie, anything you want.
4184	4187	Anything you want, l'll do.
4190	4191	For how long?
4197	4199	All of you?
4200	4205	No. Ronnie, l want to talk about this in person.
4206	4209	This is not-- We can't talk about this on the telephone.
4211	4215	Ronnie! Don't hang up! Just don't--
4220	4223	Devil's Tower, Wyoming was the first national monument...
4223	4227	...erected in this country by Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.
4227	4231	Thousands of civilian refugees are fleeing the area...
4231	4234	...spurred by rumors that the overturned tanker cars...
4235	4239	...at Walkashi Needles Junction were filled to capacity with nerve gas.
4245	4248	Fortunately, there have been no fatalities.
4248	4250	--evacuate this area, which soon...
4251	4254	...will become the ''hotzone,'' depending on the prevailing winds.
4255	4258	This is as close to the disaster as we've been allowed to get.
4259	4261	--due to a strong prevailing north-south wind.
4261	4264	Army engineers and the Wyoming National Guard...
4264	4268	...are making every effort to contain the leaking toxins...
4268	4271	...and evacuate an area ofalmost 200 square miles.
4272	4275	Everyone is being warned: Stay out of the area.
4275	4278	Everyone, please, stay out of the area.
4278	4280	--thousands of others are homeless.
4281	4285	U.S. Army Materiel Command has issued these new area restrictions:
4285	4289	All roadways north of Crowheart on lnterstate 25.
4289	4292	All roads leading into the Grand Tetons west ofMeteste.
4292	4295	All multilane undivided full traffic interchange...
4296	4300	...railroad, local and historic stage roads south of Cody.
4310	4313	Why aren't there fat lines instead of these thin ones?
4317	4319	You're going the wrong way!
4321	4324	Turn back around. Back this way.
4325	4327	What's the matter with you?
4327	4329	Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.
4329	4332	lt's just a rental, officer.
4332	4334	My fault! My fault!
4334	4336	Starting with the letter ''F,'' as in ''Frank''...
4337	4339	...to the letter ''J'' as in ''Jack''...
4339	4343	...please find your way to the loading platform forimmediate boarding.
4347	4349	You'll be real disappointed and sorry...
4349	4354	...if you don't have an early warning system, such as a bird, a gas mask.
4354	4356	Why, even my dog has a gas mask.
4356	4359	And any of you folks are worth more than a dog.
4391	4392	Roy!
4404	4407	l don't care where you go, just get behind the barricade!
4434	4435	Why are we here?
4435	4439	The only way there is across country. We'll break through the fence.
4439	4441	-Let's go. -All right, hold on.
4465	4467	The police dragged the river for him.
4467	4470	l told them he wasn't in the river. He wasn't.
4471	4475	Then they went around to every house within five miles...
4476	4480	...looking inside backyard refrigerators.
4484	4488	They asked if l'd seen any strangers in the neighbourhood.
4556	4558	l don't believe it's real.
4560	4562	l don't believe it's real!
4563	4565	lt's real.
4572	4575	Let's get down there. Get some gas and get down in there.
4578	4579	What are those?
4604	4608	Look, l guarantee you. This whole thing is a put-on.
4655	4657	What do you want? Get your hands off!
4659	4662	-How are you feeling? -l feel fine!
4662	4666	According to my birds, the bad air is from you guys farting around!
4677	4679	-Move them out! -What's happening?
4679	4681	Where are we going?
4681	4683	Where are you taking her?
4683	4685	Hold it! Why can't we go together?
4685	4686	Watch your step.
4705	4708	We have very little time, Mr. Neary. This is Mr. Lacombe.
4709	4712	We need answers from you that are honest, direct and to the point.
4712	4714	Where is Jillian?
4716	4719	Do you realize the danger you and your friend have risked?
4720	4723	ln coming here, you've exposed yourself to toxic gas.
4724	4725	Well, l'm alive.
4725	4727	We're talking.
4728	4730	This is true, Mr. Neary.
4731	4734	But if the wind blew from the south instead of the north...
4735	4738	...this conversation would not be taking place.
4738	4740	There's nothing wrong with the air.
4741	4743	What makes you say that?
4743	4745	l just know. There's nothing wrong with it.
4746	4748	Go outside and make me a liar.
4752	4755	l want to talk to the man in charge.
4755	4757	Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.
4758	4760	He isn't even an American.
4762	4765	Mr. Neary, are you an artist or a painter?
4766	4767	No.
4771	4774	Have you been hearing a persistent ringing in your ears?
4774	4776	Almost an agreeable ringing?
4776	4777	No.
4779	4781	Having headaches, migraines?
4781	4782	Yeah.
4784	4786	An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses?
4786	4787	Yeah.
4788	4791	Do you have hives? Do you have allergies?
4793	4796	And burning on your face and on your body?
4796	4798	-Yes. Who are you people? -Look at this.
4799	4802	l got one like it in my living room. Who are you?
4808	4810	Monsieur Neary, please, one more question.
4812	4814	Have you recently had a close encounter?
4816	4819	A close encounter with something very unusual?
4822	4824	Who are you people?
4830	4834	-These people strangers to you? -Yeah. Except for her.
4836	4839	And the two of you felt compelled to be here?
4840	4842	Yeah, you might say that.
4843	4846	-But what did you expect to find? -An answer.
4848	4850	That's not crazy, is it?
4866	4869	Hold it, hold it, hold it.
4869	4870	ls that it?
4871	4874	ls that all you're going to ask me?
4875	4877	l got a couple of thousand goddamn questions.
4877	4882	l want to speak to someone in charge. l want to lodge a complaint.
4882	4884	You have no right to make people crazy.
4884	4889	You think l investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is?
4889	4893	lf this is just nerve gas, how come l know everything in such detail?
4893	4895	l've never been here before.
4896	4898	How come l know so much?
4898	4900	What the hell is going on around here?!
4900	4902	Who the hell are you people?!
4927	4929	ls that it?! Answer me!
4930	4933	l didn't come this far to get taken on any bus ride home!
4956	4958	Five minutes. Five!
4958	4961	We're gonna hold for a couple of minutes.
4995	4998	You brought 1 2 people to the decontamination camp...
4998	5003	...instead of the evacuation centre where they belong. Why?
5003	5006	-Because this means something. -This means something.
5007	5011	These people have come from all over their country...
5013	5016	...to a place they've been told will endanger their lives.
5016	5017	Why?
5017	5021	Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation...
5021	5025	...by sending in fanatics, cultists and Christ knows what all.
5032	5035	This is a small group of people...
5036	5040	...who have shared a vision in common.
5040	5041	Look.
5045	5048	lt's still a mystery to me why they are here.
5048	5050	Even they do not know why.
5072	5073	Don't! You'll be poisoned!
5074	5077	Listen, there's nothing wrong with the air around here.
5077	5081	The Army's getting us out because they don't want any witnesses.
5082	5085	lf the Army doesn't want us here, it's none of our business.
5086	5089	We wanted to see the mountain. lt was a coincidence when l painted it.
5089	5091	You can take it off!
5091	5094	The air here is better than in Los Angeles.
5095	5099	Listen. How many of you people are for getting out of here?
5104	5108	l don't know what's happening either. l must find out.
5112	5117	For every one of these anxious, anguished people who've come here...
5120	5124	...there must be hundreds more touched by the vision who never made it here.
5125	5128	Simply because they never watch the television.
5130	5133	Or perhaps they watched it, but never made the psychic connection.
5134	5137	lt's a coincidence. lt's not scientific.
5140	5142	Listen to me, Major Walsh...
5142	5145	...it is an event sociological.
5164	5166	Wait a minute!
5182	5184	-My name's Neary! -Larry Butler!
5184	5186	-How are you? -Okay! You?
5186	5188	-Fine, fine! -That's good!
5188	5193	Everybody keep their masks on until you're out of here and out of danger.
5193	5197	Listen, we want to get out of here! What's the matter with you?
5215	5218	l'll have the rest of them off the mountain in one hour.
5219	5221	Major, l wantyou to use infrared...
5222	5224	...and get me a photo analysis of the northern face.
5224	5226	Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.
5227	5229	Major Walsh, listen.
5229	5232	l don't like to do this. We're in enough trouble with these cattlemen.
5233	5237	lfyou can't get these folks out of the area by 20:00 hours...
5237	5239	...start dusting with EZ-4.
5240	5241	What's EZ-4?
5241	5245	lt's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we used with the livestock.
5245	5246	Comes out of Riot Control.
5247	5250	They'll sleep for six hours and wake up with a headache, that's all.
5251	5254	We didn't choose this place. We didn't choose these people.
5255	5257	They were invited!
5263	5265	They belong here more than we.
5273	5274	l shouldn't have given up jogging.
5275	5278	See that notch in the mountain? We'll make it in no time.
5278	5280	Here come three more.
5283	5285	The authority in this park...
5285	5289	...has been superseded by the United States government.
5289	5291	There's a ravine leading straight up.
5292	5295	-lt's an easier climb. -lt's no good.
5295	5298	When you get to the top, it's a 300-foot drop down. Get down!
5299	5301	What do you think it's like on the other side?
5302	5305	There's a box canyon on the other side with ravines and trails...
5305	5307	...if you take this incline to the right.
5308	5310	l never imagined that. l only painted one side.
5311	5314	-There was no canyon in my doodles. -Next time, sculpt.
5314	5317	You give us a lot of credit. That's an hour's climb.
5317	5318	Come on, let's go.
5324	5326	The authority in this park...
5326	5331	...has been superseded by the United States government.
5331	5336	You are entering a military reservation...
5336	5338	...and subject to military law.
5339	5340	Call the bastard.
5344	5346	Bahama, this is pyramid. Over.
5346	5347	Go ahead.
5348	5350	Nothing to report at midstation.
5350	5353	Up ahead there's thousands of places to hide.
5353	5357	We'll need three times the men to cover this in one hour.
5358	5361	Get everybody off the northern face, call the otherside...
5361	5363	...and tell them we're gonna dust.
5389	5391	Get down!
5392	5395	You are entering a military reservation...
5395	5398	...and subject to military law.
5428	5431	Larry! Larry, come on!
5449	5452	Larry! Don't let them see you! Get down!
5488	5491	They're just crop-dusting. Los Angeles!
5497	5498	Don't stop!
5499	5501	Don't look back! Come on, come on!
5532	5535	Hurry! We're only 1 0 feet from the top.
