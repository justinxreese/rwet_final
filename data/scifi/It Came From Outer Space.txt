40	42	This is Sand Rock, Arizona...
43	45	of a late evening in early spring.
46	50	It's a nice town, knowing its past and sure of its future...
50	54	as it makes ready for the night and the predictable morning.
56	59	The desert blankets the earth, cooling...
59	62	resting for the fight with tomorrow's sun.
63	67	And in my house, near the town, we are also sure of the future.
68	69	So very sure.
80	81	12:00, sharp.
81	85	Trying to get rid of me? 'Cause if you are, it won't do you any good.
85	86	Well, I wouldn't want people to talk.
87	89	Let them. They do it anyway.
92	94	You know, I think it must be my money that impresses you.
94	98	- What money? - I got a cheque today.
99	101	Johnny, you sold another article!
102	106	Got enough to finish the outside of the house. All the comforts of home.
106	109	To think of the time I wasted living in the city.
109	111	It's nice out here.
111	114	Question is, would you keep this up if we were married?
114	116	Of course not.
116	118	As soon as I got your name on the marriage certificate...
118	120	I wouldn't have to do it any more.
122	124	Let's go see what the stars have to say.
126	128	I already know your horoscope.
142	145	You know who the stars say a man born under your sign should marry?
145	148	- No, who? - Me.
148	151	I'm a Scorpio, and a Scorpio always gets along well with a Sagittarius.
152	154	Really? What else do they say?
156	159	A Sagittarius is philosophical and very positive.
160	162	And has a blithe, happy-go-lucky manner.
165	170	Would starve if someone didn't come along to make him a meal occasionally.
175	178	And is quite helpless in certain situations.
181	184	Come here, look at my stars.
186	190	Tell me if they say whether a Sagittarius could support a Scorpio.
191	194	"Starlight, star bright First star I've seen tonight
196	199	"I wish I may, I wish I might
200	203	"Have the wish I wish tonight"
237	239	- What was that? - A meteor.
240	242	One of the biggest.
249	252	- Can you see it? - Yeah.
253	254	Yeah, there it is.
255	257	It's by the old Excelsior Mine.
436	439	- You're crazy. - He's dead serious.
439	440	Didn't you even hear it?
440	442	I didn't hear nothing until you kept banging on my door.
445	446	Look!
448	450	It's beautiful!
454	457	- Come on, let's go down. - All right, all right, keep your shirt on.
485	486	Holy cow!
506	508	Brother, that's really something.
508	511	It's the biggest thing that's ever happened in our time.
511	513	- I'm gonna take a closer look. - Oh, be careful, John.
513	516	- Go ahead, be a hero. - We'll take our chances.
516	520	Who said anything about you? You stay right here. You look after Pete.
520	522	This is where Pete's going to be, right here.
662	666	- Johnny! Johnny! - Wait a minute. You stay here.
696	699	- John! - I'm all right, Pete. Down here!
701	703	Are you all right?
703	706	- Yeah, I'm all right. - Come on, let's get out of here.
706	710	- Maybe you'll listen to me next time. - John! John, are you all right?
711	713	Johnny? Johnny!
713	716	- Yeah, I wasn't hurt, Ellen. - Well, then, what's the matter?
716	717	There's something down there.
717	720	Boy, you're not kidding. A couple of tons of earth that almost hit you.
720	723	- No, that's not what I mean. - What do you mean?
723	726	- What was it you saw down there? - I'm not sure.
727	729	Some kind of a ship, I think.
729	730	- A what? - A ship.
730	733	- What kind of a ship? - I don't know.
733	735	It's like nothing we've ever seen before.
735	737	Look, something must have hit this guy in the head. Come on.
737	740	It sounds crazy, but I tell you it was there. Part of it was still showing.
740	743	Boy, you've been up in the stars too long. Come on, let's get out of here.
743	746	It's like a huge ball, rammed there in the side of the crater.
746	748	Look, this is no place to hold a conversation.
748	751	Come on. Let's go before it starts falling again.
772	774	All right, all right. I'm not crazy, and I'm not imagining.
774	776	I tell you, I saw this thing.
777	779	- Oh, brother. - I saw an open port way.
779	781	So, what was inside?
783	787	Something. Then the door slammed shut and started the landslide.
787	788	That figures. Come on.
788	790	- Pete, will you listen to me? - I did.
790	792	I let maniacs drag me off in the middle of the night.
792	794	Now, on top of that, I get rocket ships thrown at me.
797	800	Here they come to find out what happened.
800	802	Oh, please. Don't tell them what you told us.
802	805	Ellen, I tell you, I was close enough to it.
805	808	- I could have reached out and touched it. - Oh, Johnny, please.
809	813	You're not going to tell those people you saw Martians running around down there?
814	817	What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?
817	819	I'd say, "Hold him for a circus."
820	823	I'd say, "Wait and find out what they're doing here, first."
826	830	Ellen, you don't believe me, either.
830	833	Oh, I don't know.
839	842	- That's Ellen and Putnam. - There's Pete's 'copter. Hi!
844	847	Hey, what's going on? How long you been up here? What happened?
848	849	- I'll tell you what happened. - Johnny.
849	852	It's a meteor. Johnny says the biggest one that ever hit us.
852	855	It must've been. I felt it clear down to my shoes.
855	859	- Lit up the sky like the end of all creation. - It was no meteor.
860	861	No meteor?
862	865	What's the amateur astronomer's point of view?
865	867	- There's some kind of a ship down there. - A ship?
867	869	Don't ask me what kind, 'cause I don't know.
870	872	Oh, you mean from one of those stars you write about?
872	874	Or the kind that Pete, here, operates?
874	876	I tell you, the evidence is buried right down there.
876	879	This may be the biggest thing that's ever happened.
879	881	If you're smart, you'll get this whole area sealed off...
881	883	until we know what we're up against.
883	886	- You see it, Ellen? - No...
887	890	- but if John says he saw it... - He could be mistaken. You, Pete?
894	898	I tell you, from its size and its appearance, this thing came from outer space.
900	903	I even have reason to believe that there's some form of life in it.
904	907	Must've been travelling pretty fast to hit the earth that hard and stay in one piece.
907	910	- That's right. - And even if it was in one piece...
910	913	would anyone still walk around after a concussion like that?
914	916	I'm just asking, Johnny.
918	921	I want to make sure I quote you right for the paper.
921	925	- I'll take you home, Ellen. - I don't mind, Matt. I'll be all right.
946	947	Don't tell me you're going back to Sand Rock.
947	950	When Loring gets through printing that statement of yours in his paper...
950	952	they won't let you walk around out in the open.
952	954	Oh, you too, Pete? We need help, not lecturing.
954	956	Come on, Ellen.
959	961	Isn't there anyone who would want to help?
961	963	What about Dr. Snell at the Wayne Observatory?
964	965	You've done a lot of work with him.
965	968	Yeah. I'll call him as soon as we get back.
981	983	Hey, slow down.
984	987	- Johnny? - Those fools.
988	990	You can't really blame them.
991	994	I did see it. I even saw some kind of tracks.
995	998	- I can't be just imagining it. - I'm just thinking of you, Johnny.
998	1001	And people talking behind your back and laughing.
1001	1005	They've talked about me before. Even your old friend, the Sheriff.
1006	1008	Matt didn't mean anything by it.
1008	1011	He's known me all my life. You know how he looks after me.
1011	1013	I don't blame any of them.
1014	1016	Can I prove it? Even to myself?
1019	1021	Maybe if we really do find something...
1022	1024	You really have to, Johnny?
1025	1026	I have to, Ellen.
1041	1043	You'd better keep out of it for a while, though.
1043	1046	I wouldn't want them laughing at you.
1046	1049	- Look! - What's that?
1060	1063	- What was that? - I don't know.
1065	1067	Did you hit it?
1069	1070	I'll see.
1080	1083	- Keep the motor running, Johnny, please. - Yeah.
1087	1089	You stay here.
1105	1107	Come on, let's get back.
1112	1114	- What is it? - Thought I heard something.
1135	1137	- It's just a Joshua tree. - Let's get out of here.
1212	1214	- Did you get any good shots? - Pretty good.
1217	1220	The crater's about 1,000 yards around.
1226	1228	One of the biggest things that ever happened.
1228	1231	- Look how far down it goes. - Sure covers a wide area.
1231	1235	Hey, here comes our stargazer now. Come on.
1245	1247	- Snell's here. - So are the reporters.
1248	1251	And here they come. I'll try and steer them off.
1253	1255	- Good morning, John. Ellen. - Good morning.
1255	1256	- Good morning. - Missed you out at the house.
1256	1258	Dugan, American Press. Lober, Press Dispatch.
1258	1260	Gentlemen, this is Miss Fields.
1260	1264	How do you do? Quite a show you started. Any statement?
1266	1268	Why repeat it? It's all right here.
1272	1275	Stick around, I may really have something for you in a few minutes.
1279	1282	- Look, this is private. Do you mind? - Not at all.
1284	1285	How about it, Miss Fields?
1285	1287	- You add anything to this? - No.
1297	1299	- Hiya, Bob. - Hi.
1300	1303	- Well, well, John. - Hello, Dr. Snell. Glad you could get away.
1303	1304	I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
1304	1306	- How long you been here? - About an hour.
1306	1309	- You've just gotten started then. - Hardly. I've seen enough.
1309	1311	But you do believe me?
1312	1314	Look, John, last night you saw a meteor fall to earth.
1314	1316	That much has been substantiated by witnesses.
1317	1318	The presence of the crater itself...
1318	1321	its formation and characteristics, all support the theory that it was a meteor.
1321	1325	- But I tell you, I saw a ship. - You saw something that looked like a ship.
1325	1326	You can't prove it, John.
1326	1330	I can prove it if I can get you to help me dig it out of there.
1330	1333	I can't in good faith ask the University to do it.
1333	1337	We'd dig for months, and spend thousands, and maybe all we'd find would be these.
1339	1341	Note the black colouring, characteristic of the meteor.
1341	1346	The fusion from heat, the nickel and the iron. Facts, John. Facts.
1347	1351	Even the angle of contact with the earth. Everything points towards it being a meteor.
1351	1353	All right, all right. I'll admit I don't have all the answers...
1353	1356	And one more point, John. Come on.
1359	1361	- Find anything, Bob? - No, Doctor. Not a thing.
1361	1364	There you are. See, there's no sign of any excessive radioactivity...
1364	1365	anywhere in the area.
1366	1368	Odd, wouldn't you say, for something coming in from outer space?
1369	1370	I don't know what's odd and what isn't any more.
1370	1373	But I do know I expected you to be more open to the idea...
1373	1374	than the others. You're a man of science!
1375	1376	And therefore less inclined to witchcraft, John.
1376	1379	Not witchcraft, Dr. Snell. Imagination!
1379	1382	Willingness to believe that there are lots of things that we don't know anything about.
1382	1385	There was a time when people thought the earth was a level plain...
1385	1388	between two mountains that were set there to hold up the sky.
1388	1390	And that the stars were lamps hung from that sky.
1390	1393	Then a better idea came along, and people were willing to listen.
1393	1396	Be realistic, John. We've worked together before.
1396	1399	In the meantime, you can do an article for us.
1399	1400	Yeah.
1402	1405	Here. I already have.
1408	1412	- An intense young man. - Yeah, and an odd one, too.
1412	1416	More than odd, Bob. Individual and lonely. A man who thinks for himself.
1417	1420	Report on the Arrival of Strangers from Outer Space.
1433	1435	I had been hoping I'd run into you, Putnam.
1435	1437	What's the matter, Matt? Did I break a law or something?
1437	1438	Hey, you might call it that.
1438	1440	Ellen's supposed to be teaching school today.
1441	1442	I told her to stay out of this. You know Ellen.
1443	1446	Yeah, I know Ellen. I also knew her father. I was his deputy.
1447	1451	And I mean to keep an eye on her. Trouble is she keeps trailing after you.
1451	1455	See, this town doesn't understand you. Poking around out here in the desert...
1455	1457	squinting up at the stars. And now you come up with this story.
1458	1459	"This town"...
1459	1460	The reason I came out here to the desert...
1460	1463	was to try and get away from that kind of thinking.
1464	1466	Putnam, you frighten them.
1466	1469	And what frightens them, they're against. One way or another.
1469	1472	Look, Matt. I'm frightened, too.
1473	1476	You want to destroy yourself, that's your lookout. But leave Ellen alone.
1477	1478	She needs her job.
1484	1487	- Come on, Miss Fields. Give us a story. - Smile, please, Miss Fields.
1487	1489	Joe, get her, will you?
1489	1491	What about this monster you ran into last night?
1491	1493	Come on, fellows, come on. Stop bothering her, will you?
1493	1496	- Just checking your story. - What are you trying to prove?
1496	1497	That's what I was going to ask you.
1498	1500	Maybe you're getting publicity for a new book you're writing.
1501	1503	Don't get sore, Putnam. You're news now.
1506	1507	Just trying to get a story!
1513	1516	Snell agrees with the Sheriff, and the Sheriff agrees with the others.
1516	1518	- I'm crazy. - I know.
1519	1521	Matt was at me before he found you.
1521	1523	"A teacher has responsibilities to the community."
1524	1526	I just wish we had found one of them, that's all.
1526	1530	Just one little monster to toss into the principal's bedroom.
1544	1547	An occasion to make the soul tremble.
1547	1550	Thank you, sir. This is your local announcer again...
1550	1553	and here's Major Benson, of the United States Army, to give us his view.
1554	1557	Major, will the army attempt to dig underneath the crater?
1558	1560	Probably not.
1560	1563	Major, how do you feel about the report that a spaceship is buried there?
1564	1567	If there is, it'll have to wait until we can get around to it.
1567	1569	Then the army isn't afraid of any invaders?
1570	1573	Not if they are buried under hundreds of tons of...
1583	1585	Look.
1594	1596	Seems like it'll reach out.
1633	1635	It's alive.
1636	1638	And yet it looks so dead out there.
1638	1641	Oh no, it's alive and waiting for you.
1644	1647	Ready to kill you if you go too far.
1649	1652	The sun will get you, the cold at night.
1654	1657	A thousand ways the desert can kill.
1663	1665	Where are you?
1666	1669	What do you look like? What am I supposed to be looking for?
1671	1674	I know you're out there, hiding in the desert.
1676	1678	Maybe I'm looking right at you and don't even see you.
1679	1681	- Come on out! - But, John.
1701	1703	Hiya, Frank. George.
1703	1707	Where'd you two come from? Why aren't you back at the crater?
1707	1709	I don't much like the show they're putting on over there.
1709	1711	Hear they got you going, John. Are they riding you, boy?
1711	1712	They're trying to.
1712	1715	I read the morning papers. Don't let them ride you too much.
1716	1719	Have you two seen anything unusual this morning?
1720	1723	- You mean, like another meteor? - No, I don't mean like a meteor.
1723	1726	No, we ain't seen nothing. Have we, Frank?
1727	1728	- Have we, Frank? - What?
1728	1730	I said we haven't seen nothing, have we?
1730	1733	No, I haven't seen anything. But I'm sure hearing things.
1734	1735	Yeah?
1738	1741	- What kind of things? - I don't know. Darndest noise ever.
1741	1743	Never heard anything like it on the wires before.
1744	1746	- You've been out in the sun all morning. - No, it's not the sun.
1747	1748	- Mind if I give a listen? - Sure.
1748	1751	- Put him on the ladder, George. - You're the boss.
1757	1760	Here, listen. You hear it?
1765	1766	Yeah.
1768	1769	Any idea what it is?
1769	1770	I don't know.
1771	1774	It might be somebody up that way tapping the wires...
1774	1777	or back that way, listening to us, like we're listening to him.
1778	1781	- I wonder who it is. - I don't know.
1782	1783	After you've been working out on the desert...
1783	1786	fifteen years, like I have, you hear a lot of things.
1787	1790	See a lot of things, too. Sun in the sky...
1790	1792	and the heat.
1792	1796	All that sand out there with the rivers, lakes, that aren't real at all.
1796	1800	And sometimes you think that the wind gets in the wires and hums and listens and talks.
1801	1804	Just like what we're hearing now. Still hear it?
1806	1810	- No, it's gone. - That's the way it is. Comes and goes.
1811	1812	- Had enough? - Yeah.
1813	1814	Me, too.
1821	1824	- What do you make of it? - I'm not sure yet.
1827	1829	Wish I could figure it out.
1831	1833	Why don't we drive up the line a ways and take a squint?
1833	1835	Anything you say, boss.
1837	1840	- We'll have a look up the other way. - Lf you find anything, let us know.
1840	1842	Be glad to.
1853	1855	Got a big date with Jane tonight, boss.
1855	1858	If you're thinking of getting off early, the answer is no.
1858	1861	When are you gonna get married and settle down, George?
1861	1863	Soon as I find me a wife like yours.
1863	1867	- You always say the right thing, don't you? - Especially to the boss.
1896	1898	Look at that! What is it?
1924	1928	- Did you see something, John? - No. No, nothing up here.
1930	1932	We'd better go back and find Frank and George.
1932	1935	- And do you think they'll find something? - Could be.
1954	1956	- There. - Yeah.
1965	1966	Wait.
1985	1989	- Maybe they walked off in the desert. - Why would they leave the doors open?
1989	1993	They were in a hurry, all right. Maybe they chased something.
1993	1996	Or something chased them.
1999	2001	Blood.
2005	2006	Look, Johnny.
2012	2016	They saw something, all right. Whatever it was, it took them along.
2037	2039	- George. - Hello.
2040	2042	- You gave us a start. - Did I?
2042	2043	Where's Frank?
2046	2049	George, where's Frank?
2050	2052	He went off to look around.
2055	2056	There's blood on the truck. What happened?
2058	2061	- I cut my hand. See? - Is it bad...
2065	2066	What's wrong?
2068	2071	Nothing. The sun, I guess.
2073	2074	Playing tricks on me.
2080	2083	Yes, the sun. Beautiful.
2089	2090	You...
2091	2092	You found nothing up here?
2094	2096	Nothing.
2096	2098	We may as well get along, Johnny.
2099	2102	Don't worry about Frank. He'll be all right.
2105	2106	Yes.
2107	2109	I guess there's nothing more we can do up here.
2111	2114	So long, George. We'll be in touch with you.
2115	2117	So long.
2126	2128	What is it back there, John? What's the matter with his eyes?
2128	2129	He's lying.
2129	2131	I didn't want to start anything alone out here.
2131	2134	We've got to get into town and bring help.
2137	2140	- Something's happened to Frank. - He's dead.
2160	2164	- Are you all right? - What happened, George? Is the truck...
2174	2176	Don't be afraid.
2177	2181	It is within our power to transform ourselves...
2181	2185	to look like you, or anyone.
2186	2190	For a time, it will be necessary.
2191	2196	We cannot, we would not take your souls...
2196	2198	or minds, or bodies.
2205	2207	Don't be afraid.
2211	2213	Your friend is all right.
2223	2226	- Mind closing the door? - You're coming right out with us, Matt.
2226	2229	You wanted some proof, Matt? Maybe we've got something for you now.
2229	2231	- School principal was in here. - You've got to listen to him, Matt.
2232	2233	You're supposed to be teaching school.
2233	2235	Don't you hear us, Matt? We've got some proof for you now.
2235	2237	I'm a busy man, Ellen. And even if I wasn't...
2237	2240	he's not going to make a fool out of me, the way he has of you.
2240	2242	If you don't listen to him, you'll be the fool.
2242	2244	He's got you so you'll believe anything.
2246	2248	All right, just what did you see?
2248	2250	Come on, I'll show it to you. You better bring your gun.
2282	2283	The truck's gone.
2283	2286	It was right there, Matt. This time I saw, too.
2287	2289	The tracks, Johnny. Show him.
2305	2307	The tracks are gone.
2318	2322	Right here. This is where I saw him. I saw his hand.
2326	2328	Look. Blood.
2329	2332	Could have been a jackrabbit hit by a car, and crawled in through here.
2332	2334	I tell you, it was Frank. It had to be.
2334	2338	All right, it was Frank, and he's risen from the dead and gone off with his truck.
2345	2347	Now, I'm going back to town.
2358	2360	Thanks for the ride.
2363	2368	It's like beating against thin air. No marks, no signs, no nothing.
2368	2371	And, Ellen, the pallor of that face.
2372	2374	Maybe it was the sun, just playing tricks on us.
2374	2375	Was it?
2377	2380	The way he kept looking into the sun without blinking.
2380	2382	How could George do it?
2382	2385	- George couldn't. - What do you mean?
2387	2392	It's like some nightmare, where you're waiting and hoping for it to be over...
2392	2395	and then all of a sudden, you realise that it's just...
2406	2407	George? Frank?
2410	2412	Frank? George?
2413	2415	Wait! I want to talk to you.
2438	2441	George? Frank?
2441	2442	Keep away.
2444	2448	Where have you been? We've been looking all over for you.
2449	2451	I want to help you.
2453	2456	What happened out there, in the desert? Tell me, and we'll go to the Sheriff.
2456	2458	Stand back.
2460	2462	Whoever you are, whatever you are...
2463	2466	I want to understand you. I want to help you.
2466	2467	Then keep away.
2468	2470	Keep away, John Putnam.
2472	2477	We don't want to hurt you. You least of all. We don't want to hurt anyone.
2479	2483	- What have you done with them? - Your friends are alive.
2483	2486	They will not be harmed, if you do as we say.
2486	2488	What are we supposed to do?
2488	2492	Give us time. Time, or terrible things will happen.
2493	2496	Things so terrible, you have yet to dream of them.
2529	2531	Is old Tom back with that grub yet?
2531	2535	- I sure am getting powerful hungry. - Ain't seen him yet.
2535	2539	Ain't to my liking neither, hauling grub at this time of the night.
2541	2544	Come on, mule. Sam and Toby will be hungry.
2546	2548	Why, you crazy mule!
2559	2560	That you, Tom?
2563	2566	- What's going on in there? - Well, the way to tell is take a look.
2582	2585	It's just this poor old tunnel. Needs more propping up.
2585	2588	Like a man gets old. Needs propping up.
2588	2591	Wouldn't have needed it, if that meteor hadn't stuck its nose...
2592	2594	smack in that lower level.
2594	2597	Yes, we best check it in the morning.
2598	2602	- Must be Tom now. - Well, it took him long enough.
2607	2608	That you, Tom?
2619	2623	No one has yet turned up any bug-eyed monsters threatening Earth...
2623	2627	and so it must be set down as another one of those fantastic hoaxes.
2627	2630	This one by a young, publicity-seeking astronomer.
2630	2633	Of course, if he should turn up a spaceman or two...
2633	2637	this network cordially invites them to address us, one and all.
2638	2641	And now, for some last-minute news.
2644	2646	I was trying to help.
2648	2651	- What do we do now? - Nothing. We wait.
2652	2656	We sit and we wait and we trust them to make it clear for us.
2659	2662	Come on. I'll take you home.
2666	2668	You've got nothing to blame yourself about, John.
2668	2673	- What else could you do? - But, Ellen, are we right in just sitting by?
2673	2675	We are right, and we're not crazy.
2676	2679	And if we've been seeing things, it's because we did see them.
2692	2693	Evening, Miss Fields.
2695	2697	- What's the idea, Perry? - Sheriff wants to see Johnny.
2698	2702	- Yeah? What are you made-up for? - I'm a spaceman, out of the crater.
2702	2705	- Says for you to get over there, right away. - Okay, okay.
2706	2708	See you.
2723	2724	Matt.
2725	2727	- You know Frank's wife, Mrs. Daylon. - Of course.
2727	2729	- How do you do? - Miss Dean, a friend of George's.
2729	2730	- Hello, Jane. - Hi.
2730	2732	Mrs. Daylon, tell John, here, what you told me.
2732	2736	Well, the minute he came home, I knew there was something wrong.
2737	2739	It seems Frank took off under peculiar circumstances.
2739	2741	He came home and told her he was assigned...
2741	2743	to some sort of special job overnight, and left.
2743	2746	Something's wrong, I know it. He was so pale...
2746	2750	he had the queerest look in his eyes, and he never touched his food.
2750	2753	Same for George. His landlady told me he skipped dinner.
2754	2756	And that ain't like George, not with his appetite.
2757	2761	Mr. Putnam, the Sheriff says that you saw both of them this afternoon.
2761	2764	Did they say anything about going anywhere tonight?
2764	2767	No, Mrs. Daylon. Not a thing.
2768	2770	Maybe they had an emergency call to make.
2770	2772	Telephone people say no.
2772	2773	And that truck we couldn't find this afternoon.
2773	2775	The phone company called up and reported it missing.
2775	2778	Were they drunk or anything? Did you get it on their breath?
2778	2782	- Frank never drinks. He's sick, I tell you. - Lf you ask me, they ain't ever coming back.
2782	2784	Otherwise, what would they want to take their clothes for?
2785	2786	- Their clothes? - Yes.
2786	2787	It seems natural to take a change of clothes...
2787	2789	they said they'd be gone overnight, didn't they?
2789	2793	I know George. Always on the move, always wanting to go somewhere.
2793	2795	You best go home and get some sleep, the both of you.
2795	2796	I'll check around and call you later.
2797	2798	Ellen, Johnny and I have some things to talk over.
2798	2799	Would you mind taking the ladies home?
2800	2802	Of course, and I'll stay with Mrs. Daylon for a while, too.
2802	2805	- We're taking your car, Johnny. - I'll see you later, Ellen.
2805	2807	- Bye. - Bye.
2813	2814	Now are you ready to believe me?
2815	2817	I'm trying to, or I wouldn't have sent for you.
2817	2820	You got to believe that there's a ship buried out there in the desert.
2820	2823	And that at least some of our visitors from outer space...
2823	2824	got out of that ship before it was covered over.
2825	2826	Go on.
2827	2830	Two of those visitors I saw today, and so did you.
2831	2833	It's true, Matt.
2833	2835	It's no use, Johnny. I try to stay with you, but I can't.
2836	2838	You got to. I know what you're thinking, Matt.
2839	2841	But you've got to believe that what you saw today...
2841	2843	was only what looked like Frank and George.
2843	2845	They didn't, by any chance, tell you what they wanted?
2845	2846	They want us to trust them.
2846	2848	To believe that Frank and George are in no danger...
2848	2851	as long as we don't interfere with them. To give them time! Time!
2851	2854	Did it occur to you that you might be gambling with their lives?
2854	2857	Yes, what do you think you were doing when you refused to believe me?
2857	2862	- Frank and George, that's crazy. - I tell you, I came face to face with them.
2862	2864	But how could they take over anyone else's form?
2864	2866	- And where's the real Frank and George? - I don't know.
2866	2868	And why would they want to do that? Why?
2870	2873	Maybe to move about freely. To come into town without being stopped.
2873	2876	So they steal a telephone truck, something that'll stick out like a torch.
2876	2878	Now, does that make sense?
2879	2882	It might. Suppose they wanted electrical equipment. That truck was loaded with it.
2888	2892	As a matter of fact, things have been happening around here this evening.
2892	2894	The hardware store was broken into.
2894	2897	And they're missing a coil of copper wire and some metal parts.
2897	2899	Nothing else taken but electrical equipment.
2899	2900	There you are.
2906	2909	Yeah? Yeah, this is Sheriff Warren.
2910	2915	No, the last I saw of Dr. Snell and his assistant, they were out at the crater.
2915	2919	You let me know If you hear anything, and if I hear anything, I'll give you a ring.
2921	2924	What about Dr. Snell? Would they have any use for him?
2926	2931	- They might. He's an astronomer. Why? - That was his secretary calling.
2931	2934	They haven't seen him or his assistant.
2934	2937	Last I saw of them, they were out on the desert, working alone.
2938	2939	Let's go.
2969	2970	Well, they're not around here...
2970	2973	and it's a cinch they just didn't leave without their car.
2973	2975	I'd give anything if things were back the way were this morning...
2975	2977	with me calling you a fool.
2979	2982	Is it reasonable for anything to stay alive, after hitting Earth that hard?
2983	2984	It's reasonable, because it's true.
2984	2988	Believing all this talk about taking over other people's forms. That's crazy, I tell you.
2988	2990	Nothing would ever add up.
2990	2994	I couldn't even be sure that you're John Putnam standing beside me.
2994	2995	That's right, you couldn't.
2997	3000	Wouldn't it be a fine trick if I weren't really John Putnam at all?
3002	3006	Something from another world, come here to give you a lot of false leads.
3065	3068	Frank, what are you doing here?
3068	3071	I have been waiting for you.
3071	3075	We've been looking all over for you. Are you all right?
3075	3076	Yes.
3077	3081	- I'll take you home. - No. Take me to the mine.
3083	3085	No, please.
3101	3104	Hello? Who is this?
3106	3109	Who? It's for you.
3113	3115	This is John Putnam.
3118	3121	What? But...
3129	3130	Yes.
3134	3137	- They've got Ellen. - Ellen?
3138	3140	- Where? - Come on.
3154	3156	How do you know we're supposed to stop here?
3156	3158	- I know. - Well, let's go.
3158	3160	No. They want to see me alone.
3160	3162	You wait here.
3165	3168	- I was thinking about Ellen. - So am I.
3168	3172	She's safe, but if you come along, I don't know.
3173	3175	All right, I'll wait. How long?
3177	3180	- As long as it takes. - Well, be careful.
3207	3208	Ellen?
3225	3226	Ellen!
3233	3234	Ellen, wait!
3259	3260	Ellen?
3269	3270	Ellen?
3271	3272	Ellen!
3273	3274	Here.
3275	3276	Here.
3286	3289	Where's Ellen? Where's Ellen?
3290	3293	- Stay where you are. - Come out in the open.
3294	3296	- Come out where I can see you. - No.
3296	3301	Let me see you as you really are. What do you want? What are you doing?
3301	3304	We are repairing our ship, to leave your world.
3305	3306	We need your help.
3306	3307	You ask me to help you.
3307	3311	How can I, when you've kidnapped and stolen? For all I know, even murdered.
3311	3316	We have a long way to go. By nightfall, we will have left your earth.
3317	3320	You will not see us until it is time.
3321	3324	Time for what? Time to kill? Time to take over?
3324	3328	We have souls and minds, and we are good.
3328	3329	Then why are you hiding?
3329	3333	- We are not yet ready to meet in friendship. - Why not?
3333	3337	Because you would be horrified at the sight of us.
3339	3344	Had you fallen on our world, it might have been different.
3346	3348	We understand more.
3348	3352	All I understand is that you've taken my friends captive. And now the girl.
3352	3355	We hold her hostage, as well as the others.
3355	3360	Keep your people away, or we will destroy them.
3361	3364	How do I know that your whole mission here isn't to destroy all of us?
3364	3369	Our mission was to another world. You must believe me.
3370	3373	Only an error dragged us toward Earth.
3373	3376	- Stand out in the sun. - In time, perhaps.
3377	3378	Then I can't believe you.
3379	3383	Let us stay apart, the people of your world and ours.
3384	3387	For if we come together, there will only be destruction.
3387	3389	I've got to see you as you really are.
3389	3392	Come out, or I can't take the responsibility of protecting you.
3392	3396	Very well, then. You asked to see this.
3397	3398	So you shall.
3476	3477	Where's Ellen?
3478	3480	- She's safe. - Where?
3482	3485	- What did they do to you? - Nothing.
3486	3489	Men don't look the way you look for nothing.
3489	3493	I saw them, Matt. I saw them as they really are.
3494	3496	- Horrible. - You left Ellen with them?
3497	3499	She's safe, as long as we don't interfere.
3499	3502	Maybe that's the way you want it, but not me.
3502	3503	I want Ellen and the rest of them out now.
3504	3506	Think I would've walked off and left her, if I didn't have to?
3506	3507	They're leaving tonight.
3507	3510	They crashed here by mistake, and now they're fixing their ship to get out!
3510	3513	They can't get out. They're buried under tons of Earth. Now take me to Ellen.
3513	3515	I tell you, she's safe as long as you don't interfere!
3515	3518	Then why don't they come out in the open?
3518	3520	Because they don't trust us.
3520	3522	Because what we don't understand, we want to destroy.
3522	3524	I kill only what tries to kill me.
3527	3529	That spider...
3530	3533	why are you afraid of it? Because it has eight legs?
3534	3537	Because its mouth moves from side to side, instead of up and down?
3537	3539	If it came towards you, what would you do?
3542	3543	This.
3543	3547	Exactly as you'd destroy anything you didn't understand. Don't you see, Matt?
3547	3550	That's why they've been hiding behind other men's faces until they can clear out.
3550	3552	You're wasting time. Are you going to tell me where they are...
3552	3555	or do I form a posse and run the desert with a net until we find them?
3555	3556	Once before you wouldn't believe me.
3556	3559	When are you going to stop being a badge and become a human being?
3559	3561	That's my job. A thing is wrong, you set it right.
3561	3565	Matt, listen to me. They weren't fooling. They need a few more hours.
3565	3570	If you go to them with men now, they'll kill Ellen! Is that what you want?
3572	3574	All right, we'll wait.
3575	3578	But the responsibility is yours. Now, where are they?
3580	3582	They're in the old Excelsior mineshaft.
3583	3585	Now, come on, come on. Let's get back to town.
3671	3674	I want everyone out of the area. No exceptions.
3674	3677	Reed, make it sound like there's nothing to it.
3680	3683	I think you're making a mistake.
3683	3686	This fellow Putnam, he's done nothing but talk you out of things...
3686	3687	and get his own way.
3687	3690	He runs you ragged. Now he's got you sitting by, just waiting.
3690	3693	So far, we don't know any more than we knew at the beginning.
3693	3695	And Ellen's still missing. If I was you...
3696	3700	I'd get them rifles into the hands of some men and clean it up, whatever it is.
3700	3703	- I gave you an order, now get going! - Okay, Sheriff.
3706	3708	But I wouldn't want the responsibility.
3717	3720	Well, I'm playing it your way, right down the line.
3720	3723	Even clearing everyone away from the crater.
3726	3728	- That's the way you wanted it, right? - It's got to be right.
3728	3733	What are you doing here? I thought you were going to sweat it out at home.
3733	3737	They paid me a visit, Matt. They took some of my clothes.
3737	3740	- Why do you suppose they'd do that? - I don't know.
3740	3743	It's couldn't be that they've been lying to you, could it?
3746	3749	That old mine they've been hiding in. There were three men working it.
3749	3750	They ever tell you what happened to them?
3750	3753	What do they want with so many of us? What are they planning, Johnny?
3753	3756	- Are they telling the truth, or what? - You keep throwing these questions at me.
3756	3758	All I can do is guess.
3758	3761	Now your clothes, too. Could be any one of them.
3761	3763	Stop working yourself up, Matt.
3763	3766	It's hot enough without raising your blood pressure.
3766	3767	Yeah.
3776	3779	Did you know, Putnam, that more murders are committed at 92 degrees Fahrenheit...
3779	3780	than any other temperature?
3783	3787	I read an article once: Lower temperatures, people are easy-going.
3787	3791	Over 92, it's too hot to move. But just 92, people get irritable.
3796	3797	That clock...
3803	3804	Don't do anything.
3805	3806	Look at him. Walking around like he belongs here.
3806	3808	The sooner they finish, the sooner they'll clear out.
3808	3810	How do we know when they're really wearing our clothes...
3810	3811	or Frank's, or George's, or Ellen's?
3811	3813	We've come this far, we've got to see it through.
3813	3815	What do you mean? How do we know they're not taking over?
3815	3817	They could be all around us and I wouldn't know it.
3817	3819	- Hey you! Wait right there! - Matt!
3838	3839	Stay where you are.
3847	3851	Sorry, Matt. It was the only way I could stop you.
3860	3862	Johnny, come here. You guys in the park, over there.
3862	3865	Sir, you in the truck. I need help. All the help I can get!
3880	3882	Look, some guy's taking off in your car.
3882	3884	We'll get to him later. Come on.
3890	3892	All right, Bill, pass out those rifles, will you?
3892	3893	You head for the point at the highway...
3893	3895	and we'll cut off the truck by taking the east route.
3895	3897	- Mike, Harry, come with me. - Okay.
3897	3899	Cut out into the desert here, and set up the barricade here.
3903	3905	All right, men, follow me!
3945	3947	All right, men, spread out across the road.
3947	3950	Throw some flares up in the front, and put some in the back, there.
3950	3953	- There's his truck. - That's it, put another one over there.
3956	3958	All right. Check your guns and check your ammunition.
3958	3960	He'll be coming any minute.
3963	3964	Here he comes now!
3965	3967	Hold your fire. Get ready.
3974	3976	All right. Let him have it.
4070	4071	Who's there?
4074	4075	Ellen?
4079	4081	No, you're not Ellen.
4084	4086	You're dressed in her clothes, but you're not Ellen.
4086	4089	They're on their way here. You brought them.
4089	4090	Listen to me.
4090	4094	I came here to warn you. I tried to stop them, you don't know how I tried.
4095	4097	You've got to get out.
4098	4101	- Just a few more hours. - Listen to me.
4113	4117	You wanted me to fall into that. Why?
4118	4120	You can no longer be trusted.
4121	4124	Whoever you are, whatever you are, listen to me!
4124	4128	I'm sorry. We did not want to use violence.
4129	4131	Now there's no other way.
4252	4255	Would you kill me, too? So this is the end?
4256	4260	- The grand total of all our dreams. - I came here to help you, not to kill.
4260	4262	Stay where you are.
4272	4275	Yes, look at its power.
4275	4280	Power to drive a ship through space. Power to tear your earth apart.
4280	4285	You know how long we've worked on this? A thousand years of reaching for the stars.
4286	4289	Now, at last, we've conquered space.
4289	4292	Ah, the dreams we had of knowing other worlds.
4292	4296	- Listen to me. There's still a way. - Is there? With a mob after us?
4297	4300	All we needed was time.
4300	4303	Let the others go. I'll try and hold off the mob.
4303	4304	And if you fail?
4305	4310	No. We'd rather have it end here, than fall into their hands.
4323	4324	Wait!
4325	4328	You speak of how wonderful it was going to be to know other worlds.
4328	4330	A thousand years of work, and you're willing to see it all end...
4331	4333	here, abruptly, here on this strange planet?
4334	4337	Is that the way you want it? When there might still be a chance?
4337	4338	Then go and stop them.
4338	4341	Free the girl first. Show the mob you mean them no harm.
4341	4343	How can I trust you?
4344	4347	You can always reach out and destroy us with that.
4361	4362	Send them out.
4383	4385	Johnny!
4388	4391	- Come on, quick. - Come on.
4422	4423	There's the entrance.
4430	4432	Clear away, everybody. Clear away. Keep running, Ellen.
4432	4434	Hey! Any way to close off this entrance?
4435	4437	- There's some dynamite back there. - Get it. Quick. Get it!
4438	4441	Hurry up. We've got to keep that posse away from them.
4476	4479	- Were they in there? - Yes.
4482	4485	I guess that takes care of them.
4486	4488	Yes. That takes care of them.
4497	4498	What's that?
4498	4500	Wait. Listen.
4528	4531	- Well, they've gone. - For good, John?
4532	4537	No, just for now. It wasn't the right time for us to meet.
4538	4539	But there'll be other nights.
4540	4542	Other stars for us to watch.
4544	4545	They'll be back.
