169	171	Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor.
172	175	We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
186	188	We're doomed!
189	191	There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
194	196	What's that?
299	301	R2-D2, where are you?
317	319	At last! Where have you been?
319	322	They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?
323	325	We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
328	330	Wait a minute. Where are you going?
342	345	The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
346	348	Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
348	350	What have you done with those plans?
351	353	We intercepted no transmissions.
354	357	Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
358	362	If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
366	370	Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans
370	372	and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
385	387	There she is! Set for stun!
392	396	She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
398	400	Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted.
400	402	You'll be deactivated for sure.
404	407	Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
407	408	Now come out before somebody sees you.
411	416	Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
420	421	I'm going to regret this.
428	433	-There goes another one. -Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
434	437	That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
439	441	Are you sure this things safe?
460	462	Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold.
463	467	The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
467	471	Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
471	474	Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
474	477	I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
478	483	I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
483	486	You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor.
486	487	Take her away!
492	496	Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
497	502	I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
502	506	-She'll die before she tells you anything. -Leave that to me.
506	509	Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
510	514	ord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made.
515	519	An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
520	522	She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
522	524	Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.
525	527	There'll be no one to stop us this time.
544	547	How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how.
549	552	We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
555	558	I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
566	567	What a desolate place this is.
573	575	Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way.
576	579	It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
580	582	What makes you think there are settlements over there?
584	586	Don't get technical with me.
587	589	What mission? What are you talking about?
592	594	I've had just about enough of you!
595	599	Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
600	603	And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
618	621	No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
656	659	That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault!
659	663	He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
667	671	Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
672	673	Over here!
675	679	Help! Please, help!
896	899	Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
933	936	Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
937	939	Look, sir -- droids.
955	957	Wake up! Wake up!
964	965	We're doomed.
974	975	Do you think they'll melt us down?
989	992	Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
1042	1045	Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
1045	1047	It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
1062	1063	No, not that.
1065	1068	I suppose you are programmed for protocol.
1068	1072	Protocol. It's my primary function set...
1072	1075	-I have no need for a protocol droid. -Of course you haven't.
1075	1078	Not in an environment such as this.
1079	1082	What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
1083	1087	Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.
1088	1091	-Do you speak Bocce? -Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in Bocce...
1092	1093	All right shut up! I'll take this one.
1097	1100	Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
1100	1103	But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
1104	1106	You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
1106	1108	Now come on, get to it!
1110	1111	All right, come on!
1114	1116	And the red one, come on.
1117	1119	Well, come on, Red, let's go.
1138	1140	Uncle Owen...
1140	1143	This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
1143	1145	Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
1149	1153	Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
1153	1156	Uncle Owen! What about that one?
1157	1158	What about that one? We'll take that one.
1160	1163	I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition.
1164	1166	I've worked with him before.
1171	1172	Okay, let's go.
1173	1177	Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
1184	1188	Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good.
1189	1192	I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
1193	1197	It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
1197	1199	Is there anything I might do to help?
1200	1205	Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
1205	1209	I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
1210	1214	Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
1215	1219	Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
1219	1223	-I see, sir. -Uh, you can call me Luke.
1224	1225	I see, sir Luke.
1226	1227	Just Luke.
1228	1231	And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations,
1231	1233	and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
1237	1240	You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
1241	1245	With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
1246	1249	-You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? -That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
1252	1254	-Have you been in many battles? -Several, I think.
1254	1256	Actually, there's not much to tell.
1256	1259	I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.
1260	1262	Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
1263	1266	Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here realgood.
1267	1268	Were you on a cruiser or...
1269	1272	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
1273	1274	What's this?
1275	1277	What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?
1278	1280	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
1285	1288	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
1291	1294	Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
1295	1298	Who is she? She's beautiful.
1298	1301	-I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. -Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
1302	1305	I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
1307	1309	Is there more to this recording?
1310	1313	Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble.
1313	1316	It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
1316	1318	...You're my only hope.
1319	1323	He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
1324	1327	And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about.
1329	1330	Our last master was Captain Antilles,
1331	1334	but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
1336	1338	Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
1338	1340	I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
1341	1343	Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,
1343	1348	but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
1349	1351	I wonder who she is.
1352	1354	It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
1358	1361	He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.
1362	1365	He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
1369	1373	I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
1380	1383	Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
1384	1388	What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
1392	1394	All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
1395	1397	I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
1398	1400	Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
1404	1407	Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
1408	1410	No, I don't think he likes you at all.
1411	1412	No, I don't like you either.
1421	1424	-You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. -What makes you think that?
1425	1428	Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
1428	1430	He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1434	1438	I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about?
1439	1442	-Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. -That old man's just a crazy old man.
1445	1447	Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.
1448	1450	That'llbe the end of it. It belongs to us now.
1452	1454	But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
1454	1456	He won't,
1457	1460	I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
1461	1463	-He knew my father? -I told you to forget it.
1465	1468	Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.
1469	1471	In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
1475	1477	I think those new droids are going to work out fine.
1480	1482	I was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.
1485	1488	And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
1490	1493	-You mean the next semester before harvest? -Sure, there're more than enough droids.
1494	1496	Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season.
1496	1501	This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.
1501	1503	And then you can go to the Academy next year.
1505	1508	-You must understand I need you here, Luke. -But it's a whole 'nother year.
1508	1511	-Look, it's only one more season. -Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
1512	1515	-Where are you going? -It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
1517	1519	Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone.
1520	1525	-It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
1526	1529	Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
1531	1533	That's what I'm afraid of.
1582	1583	What are you doing hiding there?
1584	1587	It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me.
1588	1592	I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning
1601	1604	That R2 unit has always been a problem.
1604	1608	These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.
1609	1612	How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
1613	1615	Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
1616	1618	It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.
1620	1622	-Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. -All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.
1623	1626	Boy, am I gonna get it.
1626	1629	-You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. -Oh, he excels at that, sir.
1653	1655	Have you seen Luke this morning?
1655	1657	He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
1658	1661	-Did he take those two new droids with him? -I think so.
1662	1666	Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
1668	1670	There's something dead ahead on the scanner.
1670	1672	It looks like our R2-Unit...hit the accelerator.
1696	1698	Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
1699	1701	Master Luke here is your rightful owner.
1702	1703	We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...
1705	1709	And don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
1710	1712	No, it's alright.
1713	1715	What's wrong with him now?
1715	1717	He says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
1719	1721	Sandpeople! Or worst!
1722	1724	Come on, let's have a look. Come on.
1729	1732	There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a second,
1733	1735	they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
1811	1813	Hello there!
1815	1818	Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.
1820	1823	Don't worry, he'll be all right.
1829	1831	Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.
1832	1834	You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
1838	1840	Ben? Ben Kenobi!
1841	1842	Boy, am I glad to see you!
1843	1845	The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
1849	1852	Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
1852	1854	Oh, this little droid!
1856	1861	I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...
1862	1865	He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1866	1868	Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
1876	1879	Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...
1881	1883	a long time.
1884	1887	I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
1887	1889	Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.
1891	1895	-Do you know him? -Well of course, of course I know him. He's me!
1898	1901	I haven't gone bythe name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
1904	1905	Then the droid does belong to you.
1906	1908	Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
1910	1912	Very interesting...
1913	1915	I think we better get indoors.
1916	1920	The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
1935	1938	Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
1940	1942	Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
1942	1945	I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.
1946	1949	There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
1951	1953	-No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? -Quickly, son...they're on the move.
1960	1963	No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
1963	1965	That's what your uncle told you.
1966	1969	Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
1971	1973	You fought in the Clone Wars?
1973	1976	Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
1980	1983	-I wish I'd known him. -He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy,
1985	1986	and a cunning warrior.
1987	1989	I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
1991	1993	And he was a good friend.
1995	1998	Which reminds me... I have something here for you.
2001	2003	Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough,
2004	2006	but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
2007	2009	He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan
2009	2013	on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
2013	2016	-Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. -Sure, go ahead.
2020	2021	What is it?
2022	2025	Your fathers lightsaber. his is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.
2027	2030	Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
2031	2032	An elegant weapon
2033	2035	for a more civilized age.
2038	2040	For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights
2041	2044	were the guardians of peace and justicein the Old Republic.
2045	2048	Before the dark times, before the Empire.
2053	2055	How did my father die?
2057	2059	A young Jedi named Darth Vader,
2059	2061	who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil,
2062	2066	helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.
2068	2070	He betrayed and murdered your father.
2072	2074	Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
2075	2079	Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
2080	2081	The Force?
2082	2084	Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
2085	2088	It's an energy field created by all living things.
2088	2092	It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
2100	2102	Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.
2104	2105	And where you come from.
2106	2108	-I saw part of the message he was... -I seem to have found it.
2109	2113	General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
2114	2117	Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
2117	2120	I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person,
2120	2123	but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
2125	2129	I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2-unit.
2130	2132	My father will know how to retrieve it.
2132	2135	You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
2136	2139	This is our most desperate hour.
2139	2142	Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
2157	2161	You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
2162	2166	Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
2168	2170	I need your help, Luke. She needs your help.
2170	2172	I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
2178	2181	I can't get involved! I've got work to do!
2182	2185	It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now.
2188	2191	-It's such a long way from here. -That's your uncle talking.
2192	2195	Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
2195	2197	Learn about the Force, Luke.
2204	2206	Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
2207	2210	You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
2212	2214	You must do what you feel is right, of course.
2222	2226	Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.
2226	2229	The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
2229	2234	Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
2235	2239	The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
2239	2242	The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
2243	2246	I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
2247	2251	The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
2253	2255	That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
2256	2260	The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
2261	2264	Fear will keep the local systems in line.
2265	2268	-Fear of this battle station. -And what of the Rebellion?
2268	2271	If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible,
2272	2275	however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
2276	2280	The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
2280	2283	Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture,
2283	2285	no matter what technical data they've obtained.
2286	2290	This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
2291	2293	I suggest we use it!
2293	2296	Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
2297	2301	The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
2303	2306	Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
2306	2308	Your sad devotion to that ancient religion
2309	2312	has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes,
2312	2315	or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
2322	2324	I find your lack of faith disturbing.
2327	2329	Enough of this! Vader, release him!
2329	2331	As you wish.
2333	2335	This bickering is pointless.
2337	2340	Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress
2340	2342	by the time this station is operational.
2343	2346	We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
2354	2359	It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
2360	2364	They didn't. But we are meant to think they did.
2363	2365	These tracks are side by side.
2366	2369	Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
2370	2373	These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
2373	2377	And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
2378	2381	Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
2382	2384	Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
2390	2393	If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them...
2394	2396	-home! -Wait, Luke!
2397	2398	It's too dangerous.
2422	2423	Uncle Owen!
2424	2425	Aunt Beru!
2477	2479	And, now Your Highness,
2479	2483	we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
2526	2528	There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
2529	2534	You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
2536	2539	I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now.
2541	2544	I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
2559	2561	Mos Eisley Spaceport.
2562	2566	You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
2568	2569	We must be cautious.
2610	2613	-How long have you had these droids? -About three or four seasons.
2614	2615	They're for sale if you want them.
2617	2620	-Let me see your identification. -You don't need to see his identification.
2621	2623	We don't need to see his identification.
2624	2626	These are not the droids your looking for.
2627	2629	These are not the droids we're looking for.
2629	2631	He can go about his business.
2632	2634	-You can go about your business. -Move along.
2635	2637	Move along. Move along.
2654	2657	I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
2661	2665	I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
2665	2669	The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
2672	2675	Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
2676	2679	Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step.
2680	2682	This place can be a little rough.
2683	2684	I'm ready for anything.
2688	2689	Come along, Artoo.
2740	2746	-We don't serve their kind here! -What? -Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.
2747	2750	Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.
2750	2751	I heartily agree with you sir.
2798	2801	-He doesn't like you. -I'm sorry.
2802	2804	I don't like you either
2805	2807	on't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.
2808	2811	I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
2811	2814	-I'll be careful than. -You'll be dead.
2814	2816	This little one isn't worth the effort.
2817	2818	Come let me buy you something...
2845	2847	I'm alright.
2849	2853	Chewbacca here is first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
2858	2860	I don't like the look of this.
2875	2878	Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
2878	2881	Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
2882	2884	Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
2885	2888	Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
2889	2893	-Should I have? -It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
2894	2897	I've outrun Imperial starships,
2897	2901	not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
2903	2905	She's fast enough for you, old man.
2906	2909	-What's the cargo? -Only passengers.
2910	2912	Myself, the boy, two droids,
2913	2915	and no questions asked.
2917	2918	What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
2919	2923	Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
2925	2927	Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
2928	2930	And it's going to cost you something extra.
2932	2934	Ten thousand, all in advance.
2935	2936	Ten thousand?
2938	2940	We could almost buy our own ship for that!
2940	2942	But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
2943	2945	You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
2948	2953	We can pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
2954	2956	Seventeen, huh!
2959	2961	Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.
2962	2965	-We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. -Ninety-four.
2967	2971	Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
2972	2973	All right, we'll check it out.
2986	2989	Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate.
2990	2993	This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.
2994	2998	-You'll have to sell your speeder. -That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.
3000	3002	Going somewhere, Solo?
3002	3007	Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
3007	3011	It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance.
3012	3014	Jabba's put a price on your head,
3015	3017	so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
3019	3023	- I'm lucky I found you first. -Yeah, but this time I got the money.
3023	3026	If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
3027	3030	I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
3030	3032	Jabba's through with you.
3033	3037	He has no time for smugglers who drop heir shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
3038	3041	Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
3043	3046	You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
3047	3053	-Over my dead body. -That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
3054	3055	Yes, I'll bet you have.
3070	3072	Sorry about the mess.
3081	3083	Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
3083	3087	It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
3087	3090	The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational.
3090	3092	What course shall we set?
3093	3096	Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
3097	3100	-What do you mean? -I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.
3101	3104	-Set your course for Alderaan. -With pleasure.
3105	3107	Lock the door, Artoo.
3109	3111	All right, check that side of the street.
3114	3117	It's locked. Move on to the next door.
3125	3128	I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.
3129	3131	I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault..
3132	3134	You watch your language!
3136	3138	I'll take it.
3140	3143	Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.
3143	3144	It will be enough.
3163	3166	Come out of there Solo!
3168	3169	Right here, Jabba.
3171	3174	-I've been waiting for you. -Have you now?
3176	3178	You didn't think I was going to run did you?
3180	3183	Han, my boy, there are times when you surprise me.
3184	3189	Why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that, after all we're been throught together?
3190	3193	Look Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come and see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.
3195	3197	Han, Han understand, I just can't afford to make exceptions.
3197	3200	You understand I just can't make an exception.
3200	3203	Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment...
3203	3205	...at the first sign of an Imperial starship?
3206	3208	It's not good business.
3208	3211	Look Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
3213	3215	Do you think I had a choice?
3215	3218	I got a nice easy charter now. I'll pay you back...
3218	3220	...plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
3221	3223	Han, my boy, you're the best.
3224	3229	So for an extra twenty percent
3229	3231	Fifteen Jabba, don't push it.
3232	3235	Okay, fifteen percent.  But if you fail me again,
3235	3238	I'll put a price on your head
3239	3242	so big you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
3243	3246	Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
3247	3248	Let's go.
3282	3284	What a piece of junk.
3284	3286	She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.
3287	3290	She may notlook like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
3290	3292	I've added some special modifications myself.
3293	3295	We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
3302	3303	Hello, sir.
3315	3316	All right, men. Load your weapons!
3319	3320	Stop that ship! Blast 'em!
3331	3332	Chewie, get us out of here!
3334	3338	Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
3357	3359	It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
3360	3363	Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
3374	3377	Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
3377	3381	-Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. -Watch your mouth, kid
3382	3385	We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
3385	3387	Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
3392	3394	-Here's where the fun begins! -How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
3396	3399	-It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. -Are you kidding?
3400	3402	Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
3403	3405	Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star
3405	3409	or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
3410	3413	What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield.
3436	3438	We've entered the Alderaan system.
3438	3442	Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
3443	3447	I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
3448	3450	Charming to the last.
3451	3454	You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
3455	3457	I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
3458	3462	Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony
3463	3465	that will make this battle station operational.
3466	3469	No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
3470	3475	The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
3475	3478	Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
3479	3483	In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.
3484	3488	Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base,
3488	3492	I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of
3492	3493	Alderaan.
3495	3497	No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
3498	3501	You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
3504	3508	I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time.
3508	3510	Where is the Rebel base?
3514	3515	Dantooine.
3516	3518	They're on Dantooine.
3519	3521	There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable.
3522	3524	ontinue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
3524	3526	-What? -You're far too trusting.
3526	3529	Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.
3529	3533	But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
3536	3538	Commence primary ignition.
3561	3563	Are you all right? What's wrong?
3565	3567	I felt a great disturbance in the Force...
3568	3572	as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
3573	3575	I fear something terrible has happened.
3577	3580	You'd better get on with your exercises.
3582	3586	Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
3590	3592	Don't everyone thank me at once.
3593	3596	Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
3604	3606	Now be careful, Artoo.
3615	3618	He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
3618	3622	-Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. -But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
3623	3627	That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.
3628	3630	Wookiees are known to do that.
3632	3634	I see your point, sir.
3634	3637	I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
3656	3659	Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
3660	3666	-You mean it controls your actions? -Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
3670	3674	Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
3674	3676	You don't believe in the Force, do you?
3677	3679	Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
3680	3682	I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
3683	3687	but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
3688	3691	There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
3692	3695	It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
3695	3697	I suggest you try it again, Luke.
3699	3701	This time, let go your conscious self
3704	3706	and act on instinct.
3707	3710	With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
3710	3712	Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
3722	3724	Stretch out with your feelings.
3739	3741	You see, you can do it.
3742	3745	-I call it luck. -In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
3746	3751	Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.
3753	3755	Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
3758	3760	You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
3761	3765	That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.
3772	3774	Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
3774	3778	They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
3778	3782	They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
3782	3785	She lied! She lied to us!
3785	3789	I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
3790	3792	Terminate her...immediately!
3795	3798	Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.
3801	3802	What the...?
3805	3808	Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision.
3809	3811	-It's not on any of the charts. -What's going on?
3811	3814	Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!
3814	3818	-What do you mean? Where is it? -Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
3818	3820	-What? How? -Destroyed...by the Empire!
3821	3825	The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
3827	3829	-There's another ship coming in. -Maybe they know what happened.
3830	3831	It's an Imperial fighter.
3833	3836	-It followed us! -No. It's a short range fighter.
3836	3838	There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?
3841	3843	It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
3844	3848	-Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. -It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
3849	3850	Not for long...
3853	3856	A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
3857	3859	It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
3861	3863	Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
3865	3868	-Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. -I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in range.
3871	3873	That's no moon!
3873	3876	-It's a space station. -It's too big to be a space station.
3880	3883	-I have a very bad feeling about this. -Turn the ship around.
3884	3888	Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3893	3895	Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3898	3902	-Why are we still moving towards it? -We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
3902	3904	-But there's gotta be something you can do! -There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.
3905	3908	I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
3912	3916	You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
3951	3954	To you stations! Come with me.
3964	3967	We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.
3968	3971	It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
3972	3975	They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
3976	3978	She may yet be of some use to us.
3984	3987	Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
3995	3998	There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
3999	4002	It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
4003	4007	-Did you find any droids? -No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
4007	4010	Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
4012	4015	I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since...
4018	4022	Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!
4041	4044	-Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. -I use them for smuggling.
4045	4048	I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous.
4048	4052	-Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. -Leave that to me!
4052	4055	Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
4056	4059	Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
4068	4072	The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
4074	4076	All right, let's go.
4090	4092	Hey down there,
4093	4095	could you give us a hand with this?
4105	4107	TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post?
4108	4109	TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
4122	4124	Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
4142	4146	You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
4147	4150	Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
4151	4155	-We found the computer outlet, sir. -Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
4167	4170	He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here.
4171	4173	He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
4174	4177	The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
4178	4180	A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
4183	4186	I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
4186	4190	Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
4191	4194	-I want to go with you. -Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
4194	4198	They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
4199	4202	Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.
4207	4209	The Force will be with you...always!
4219	4221	Boy you said it, Chewie.
4222	4226	-Where did you dig up that old fossil? -Ben is a great man.
4227	4229	-Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. -I didn't hear you give any ideas...
4230	4234	-Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... -Who do you think...
4235	4239	-What is it? -I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
4239	4242	He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
4242	4245	-Well, who...who has he found? -Princess Leia.
4245	4247	-The princess? She's here? -Princess? What's going on?
4248	4250	Where is she?
4256	4258	Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three.
4264	4266	I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
4267	4270	Oh, no! We've got to do something.
4270	4273	The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her.
4274	4277	Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
4280	4282	-I'm not going anywhere. -They're going to execute her.
4283	4286	Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
4286	4288	Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
4289	4292	-But they're going to kill her! -Better her than me...
4300	4302	She's rich.
4304	4305	Rich?
4306	4310	Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
4310	4313	-What? -Well more wealth that you can imagine.
4314	4316	-I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! -You'll get it!
4316	4319	-You will...
4319	4321	All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.
4321	4323	-All Right -What's your plan?
4325	4327	Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
4329	4330	Okay.
4331	4333	Now, I'm going to put these on you.
4335	4337	Okay. Han, you put these on.
4338	4341	Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
4341	4343	Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...
4344	4347	but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
4347	4350	-Lock the door! -And hope they don't have blasters.
4351	4353	That isn't very reassuring.
4404	4406	I can't see a thing in this helmet.
4438	4440	-This is not going to work. -Why didn't you say so before?
4441	4442	I did say so before!
4458	4460	Where are you taking this...thing?
4461	4463	Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
4465	4467	I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
4475	4477	He's going to pull us all apart.
4502	4503	Watch out!
4513	4515	We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
4516	4519	Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.
4524	4526	Everything is under control. Situation normal.
4527	4530	-What happened? -Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction.
4531	4534	But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you.
4535	4538	-How are you? -We're sending a squad up.
4539	4542	Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now.
4543	4547	Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.
4547	4549	Who is this? What's your operating number?
4552	4555	Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!
4570	4572	Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
4573	4574	What? Oh...the uniform.
4576	4578	I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.
4578	4582	-You're who? -I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
4582	4584	-Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? -Come on!
4586	4589	-He is here... -Obi-Wan Kenobi!
4590	4593	-What makes you think so? -A tremor in the Force.
4594	4597	The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
4598	4602	-Surely he must be dead by now. -Don't underestimate the Force.
4604	4607	The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.
4608	4610	You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
4612	4615	Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three.
4617	4619	The princess! Put all sections on alert!
4619	4623	Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
4623	4626	If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
4626	4630	Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
4639	4641	Get behind me! Get behind me!
4657	4660	-Can't get out that way. -Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
4661	4663	Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
4665	4666	See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
4668	4670	We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?
4674	4675	What was that? I didn't copy!
4676	4679	I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
4680	4684	The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.
4684	4687	Open up in there!
4688	4689	Oh, no!
4690	4692	There isn't any other way out.
4696	4698	I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
4699	4702	This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
4703	4705	-He's the brains, sweetheart. -Well, I didn't...
4707	4711	-What the hell are you doing? -Somebody has to save our skins.
4713	4716	Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
4723	4723	Get in there you big furry oaf!
4725	4728	I don't care what you smell!
4729	4730	Get in there and don't worry about it.
4733	4735	Wonderful girl!
4737	4740	Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
4742	4743	Get in there!
4756	4760	Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
4760	4763	What an incredible smell you've discovered!
4766	4768	Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
4769	4770	No! wait!
4776	4779	Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
4779	4781	Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
4782	4786	Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.
4787	4789	You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
4789	4791	It could be worst...
4794	4798	-It's worst. -There's something alive in here! -That's your imagination.
4799	4801	Something just moves past my leg!
4803	4805	Look! Did you see that?
4805	4806	What?
4828	4829	Luke! Luke! Luke!
4842	4843	Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
4844	4847	-Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. -Where?
4848	4849	Anywhere! Oh!!
4857	4858	Luke! Luke!
4882	4883	Grab him!
4883	4887	-What happened? -I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
4894	4896	I've got a very bad feeling about this.
4903	4905	-The walls are moving! -Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.
4914	4915	!!!!!!!
4929	4930	Wait a minute!
4933	4935	Threepio! Come in Threepio!
4937	4939	Threepio! Where could he be?
4944	4946	Take over!
4950	4951	Look there!
4953	4957	They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
4957	4958	Follow me!
4963	4964	You stand guard.
4969	4970	Come on!
4979	4982	Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.
4982	4985	If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
4986	4987	All right.
4997	5003	Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
5003	5006	-Get to the top! -I can't
5006	5009	Where could he be? Threepio!
5010	5011	Threepio, will you come in?
5012	5014	They aren't here! Something must have happened to them.
5015	5017	See if they've been captured. Hurry!
5021	5024	One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner!
5026	5028	-Get on top of it! -I'm trying!
5035	5037	Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?
5040	5041	Use the comlink?
5042	5044	I forgot I turned it off!
5048	5051	-Are you there, sir? -Threepio!
5051	5054	-We've had some problems... -Will you shut up and listen to me?
5054	5056	Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?
5056	5060	Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
5062	5065	Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
5065	5068	No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
5084	5086	Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!
5087	5089	Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!
5091	5094	Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.
5095	5098	Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?
5099	5101	32-63-827!
5148	5151	If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
5151	5152	Well, let's get moving!
5155	5156	Where are you going?
5157	5158	No, wait. They'll hear!
5160	5161	Come here, you big coward!
5165	5167	Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from,
5168	5170	but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
5171	5173	Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!
5174	5177	I take orders from one person! Me!
5178	5179	It's a wonder you're still alive.
5179	5182	Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
5183	5185	No reward is worth this.
5195	5198	Give me regular reports.
5200	5204	-Do you know what's going on? -Maybe it's another drill.
5215	5216	What was that?
5217	5220	Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
5226	5228	-There she is. -See-Threepio, do you copy?
5229	5231	-Are you safe? -For the moment.
5232	5234	Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
5235	5237	We're right above you. Stand by.
5238	5241	-You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. -Nice! Come on!
5246	5247	It's them! Blast them!
5249	5252	-Get back to the ship! -Where are you going? Come back!
5252	5255	-He certainly has courage. -What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?
5281	5283	I think we took a wrong turn.
5288	5290	There's no lock!
5293	5296	-That oughta hold it for a while. -Quick, we've got to get across.
5296	5299	-Find the control that extends the bridge. -Oh, I think I just blasted it.
5300	5300	They're coming through!
5323	5324	Here, hold this.
5342	5343	Here they come!
5354	5355	For luck!
5381	5383	Where could they be?
5387	5388	Close the blast doors!
5396	5397	Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
5416	5420	I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last.
5422	5423	The circle is now complete.
5424	5428	When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
5428	5431	Only a master of evil, Darth.
5451	5452	Your powers are weak, old man.
5453	5456	You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down,
5456	5460	I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
5468	5470	You should not have come back.
5496	5497	Didn't we just leave this party?
5500	5502	-What kept you? -We ran into some old friends.
5503	5505	-Is the ship all right? -Seems okay, if we can get to it.
5505	5507	Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
5522	5523	Look!
5526	5528	Come on, Artoo, we're going!
5530	5531	Now's our chance! Go!
5535	5535	Ben!
5551	5552	No!
5561	5563	-Come on! -Come on!
5565	5567	-Luke, its too late! -Blast the door! Kid!
5577	5579	Run, Luke! Run!
5583	5586	I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.
5619	5621	We're coming up on the sentry ships.
5622	5624	Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
5634	5635	I can't believe he's gone.
5640	5643	-There wasn't anything you could have done. -Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
5661	5663	You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!
5675	5676	Here they come!
5693	5695	They're coming in too fast!
5703	5707	-We've lost lateral controls. -Don't worry, she'll hold together.
5709	5711	You hear me, baby? Hold together!
5733	5734	Got him! I got him!
5735	5736	Great kid! Don't get cocky.
5738	5739	There are still two more of them out there!
5774	5776	-That's it! We did it! -We did it!
5777	5780	Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.
5788	5792	-Are they away? -They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
5793	5796	You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
5797	5801	I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.
5803	5804	Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
5805	5807	You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
5808	5811	That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go.
5812	5813	It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
5814	5819	-Easy...you call that easy? -Their tracking us! -Not this ship, sister.
5820	5822	At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
5823	5824	What's so important? What's he carrying?
5825	5828	The technical readouts of that battle station.
5829	5831	I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.
5832	5835	-It's not over yet! -It is for me, sister!
5835	5839	I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
5839	5842	I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!
5842	5845	You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love,
5845	5847	then that's what you'll receive!
5850	5854	Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything
5854	5855	...or anyone.
5856	5857	I care!
5867	5870	-So...what do you think of her, Han? -I'm trying not to, kid!
5871	5872	Good...
5876	5878	Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
5881	5883	Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
5884	5885	No!
5932	5935	You're safe! We had feared the worst.
5936	5938	We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander.
5938	5941	You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.
5964	5966	-Yes. -We are approaching the planet Yavin.
5966	5968	The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
5969	5971	We are preparing to orbit the planet.
5979	5982	The battle station is heavily shielded
5983	5985	and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.
5986	5990	It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
5991	5995	A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
5998	6001	Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
6001	6005	Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat,
6006	6008	or they'd have a tighter defense.
6009	6013	An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated
6013	6016	a weakness in the battle station.
6016	6018	The approach will not be easy.
6019	6021	You are required to maneuver straight down this trench
6022	6024	and skim the surface to this point.
6025	6027	The target area is only two meters wide.
6028	6032	It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.
6033	6035	The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
6036	6040	A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
6041	6044	Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
6045	6048	The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
6048	6051	-That's impossible, even for a computer. -It's not impossible.
6052	6056	I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
6057	6060	Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
6068	6071	Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
6071	6074	The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
6075	6077	This will be a day long remembered.
6078	6080	It has seen the end of Kenobi
6080	6083	and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
6088	6089	All flight trooper, man your stations.
6092	6093	All flight troops, man your stations.
6098	6100	So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
6100	6101	That's right, yeah!
6103	6106	I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.
6106	6109	Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?
6111	6113	Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
6114	6118	Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
6119	6122	They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
6123	6125	What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
6125	6129	Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
6130	6131	It's more like suicide.
6133	6137	All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
6139	6140	Hey, Luke...
6143	6145	may the Force be with you!
6152	6155	What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.
6171	6173	-What's wrong? -Oh, it's Han!
6173	6176	I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
6176	6179	He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
6180	6183	I only wish Ben were here.
6196	6199	-Luke! -Biggs!
6199	6201	How are you?
6202	6204	I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
6205	6206	Skywalker!
6207	6209	Are you sure you can handle this ship?
6210	6212	Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
6213	6216	-You'll do better than all right. -Thank you, sir. I'll try.
6216	6219	I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
6220	6222	I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
6223	6226	It's going to be like old times, they'll never stop us.
6229	6231	This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
6232	6234	Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together.
6235	6236	You okay, Artoo?
6238	6238	Good.
6243	6246	Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.

6299	6301	Luke, the Force will be with you.
6314	6317	Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching.

6363	6364	-Look at the size of that thing! -Cut the chatter, Red Two.
6364	6366	Accelerate to attack speed.
6370	6372	-This is it, boys! -Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
6373	6374	-I copy, Gold Leader.
6375	6378	We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position.
6394	6397	Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low.
6405	6406	This is Red Five. I'm going in!
6411	6412	Luke, pull up!
6413	6416	-Are you all right? -I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
6422	6425	We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
6426	6429	We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
6432	6437	-Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. -I'm on it.
6437	6441	-I'm going in, cover me Parkins! -I'm right with you, Red 3!
6447	6448	I've go a problem here...
6449	6452	-Pull up -No, I'm alright...
6457	6460	Rebel base will be in range in seven minutes.
6464	6467	Luke, trust your feelings!
6475	6478	Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.
6479	6482	-Enemy fighters coming your way. -My scope's negative. I don't see anything.
6482	6484	-Keep up your visual scanning. -Here the come.
6487	6490	Watch it, you've got one on your tail.
6495	6496	I'm hit!
6497	6499	-You've picked one up...watch it! -I can't see it!
6502	6503	He's on me tight, I can't shake him.
6505	6506	I'll be right there.
6519	6523	Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
6529	6531	Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!
6538	6541	I'm hit, but not bad. Artoo, see what you can do with it.
6544	6546	Red Six can you see Red Five?
6546	6548	There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?
6549	6550	I can't shake him!
6554	6555	I'm on him, Luke!
6559	6560	Biggs, where are you?
6568	6569	-Thanks, Wedge. -Good shooting, Wedge!
6570	6573	Red Leader this is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run.
6575	6577	I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.
6580	6581	Stay in attack formation!
6582	6585	The exhaust post is...
6593	6597	Switch power to front deflector screens.
6602	6604	How many guns do you think, Gold Five.
6604	6606	I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers.
6607	6609	Death Star will be in range in five minutes.
6612	6614	Switching to targeting computer.
6618	6619	Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
6623	6624	The guns...they've stopped!
6626	6628	Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
6629	6631	They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.
6633	6636	-I'll take them myself! Cover me! -Yes, sir.
6651	6654	-I can't maneuver! -We're too close.
6654	6656	-We're too close. -Stay on target!
6658	6659	Loosen up!
6661	6664	Gold Five to Red Leader... Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.
6665	6667	-I copy, Gold Five. -They came from behind....
6673	6676	We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
6676	6679	-Should I have your ship standing by? -Evacuate?
6679	6682	In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
6684	6686	Rebel base, three minutes and closing.
6687	6689	Red Group, this is Red Leader.
6689	6690	Rendezvous at mark six point one.
6691	6693	-This is Red Two. Flying toward you. -Red Three, standing by.
6695	6696	Red Leader, this is Base One.
6697	6698	Keep half your group out of range for the next run.
6699	6701	Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three.
6701	6704	Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.
6714	6715	This is it!
6719	6721	We should be able to see it by now.
6723	6725	Keep your eyes open for those fighters!
6727	6729	There's too much interference! Red Five, can you see them from where you are?
6729	6731	No sign of any...wait! Coming in point three five.
6733	6734	I see them. I'm in range.
6736	6737	Target's coming up!
6740	6743	Just hold them off for a few seconds.
6744	6745	Close up formation.
6747	6748	Almost there!
6757	6761	-You'd better let her loose.
6762	6763	I can't hold them!
6772	6773	It's away!
6777	6781	-It's a hit! -Negative. Negative! It didn't go in.
6781	6783	It just impacted on the surface.
6790	6794	Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point oh-five; we'll cover for you.
6795	6797	Stay there I just lost my starboard engine.
6798	6800	Get set to make your attack run.
6813	6816	Rebel base, one minute and closing.
6817	6820	Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
6820	6823	-We're going in full throttle. -Right with you, boss.
6824	6826	Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?
6827	6828	It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
6836	6838	We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
6838	6841	My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!
6841	6843	Are you sure the computer can hit it?
6846	6849	-Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! -What about the tower?
6850	6852	You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!
6858	6862	Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down!
6882	6883	I'm hit!
6883	6886	-Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back there! -Sorry!
6888	6890	Let him go! Stay on the leader!
6893	6895	Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!
6899	6901	Artoo, try and increase the power!
6907	6908	Hurry up, Luke!
6909	6911	Wait!
6917	6920	Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.
6921	6922	I'm on the leader.
6925	6926	Hang on, Artoo!
6942	6944	Use the Force, Luke.
6948	6949	Let go, Luke.
6951	6953	The Force is strong with this one!
6954	6955	Luke, trust me.
6961	6964	His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.
6964	6967	-What's wrong? -I'm all right.
6981	6982	I've lost Artoo!
6983	6987	The Death Star has cleared the planet. The Death Star has cleared the planet.
6989	6991	Rebel base, in range.
6991	6993	You may fire when ready.
6993	6995	Commence primary ignition.
7009	7010	I have you now.
7013	7014	What?
7024	7027	You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home!
7034	7035	Stand by.
7039	7040	Stand by.
7050	7053	Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.
7054	7058	Remember, the Force will be with you...always.
7083	7085	-Hey! Hey! -I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!
7086	7087	Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
7088	7090	Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
7092	7096	Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something!
7097	7100	-You can repair him, can't you? -We'll get to work on him right away.
7100	7104	You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
7104	7108	He'll be all right.
