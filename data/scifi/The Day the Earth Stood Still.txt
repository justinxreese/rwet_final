126	128	Holy mackerel!
129	131	Call headquarters. Get the lieutenant.
138	141	Holy Christmas! That thing's doing about 4,000!
141	143	But that's incredible, sir.
143	146	That can't be aircraft. Must be a buzz bomb.
148	150	This is Luckton at Ferris to Charlie Baker.
150	156	I have a bogey at 200,000 feet. 4,000 miles an hour.
158	160	(speaks Hindustani)
164	166	(man speaking French on radio)
172	176	Reports are coming in from all over the Empire, all over the world.
176	180	The government has not yet issued a statement, but there is no question
180	182	that there actually is a large, unidentified object
182	185	circling the Earth at incredible speed.
185	187	This is Elmer Davis again.
187	192	We still don't know what it is or where it comes from, but there's something there.
192	197	It's been tracked around the Earth by radar, travelling at a rate of 4,000 miles an hour.
197	200	This is not another "flying saucer" scare.
201	204	Scientists and military men are already agreed on that.
204	206	Whatever it is, it's something real.
207	211	We interrupt this programme to give you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.
212	214	An object travelling at supersonic speed
214	217	is headed towards the East Coast of the States.
217	220	This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.
220	226	Here in the nation's capital there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic.
226	232	As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy - the beautiful spring weather,
232	236	the tourist crowds around the public monuments and other buildings.
240	242	(distant humming)
250	253	(humming crescendoes)
289	291	(screaming)
327	331	They're here!
331	334	They've landed! Over on the Mall! They've landed!
335	337	(sirens)
377	381	- Get me the Chief of Staff. - Thank you. Hold the line, please.
383	386	Hello. I want to speak to the president.
386	389	I'm sorry, but you'll have to interrupt him.
390	392	Good afternoon. This is Drew Pearson.
392	395	We bring you this special broadcast
395	399	in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon:
399	402	The arrival of a spaceship in Washington.
402	406	Government and Defense Department officials are concerned by reports of panic
406	409	in several large eastern cities.
409	415	I am authorised to assure you that, so far, there is no reasonable cause for alarm.
415	420	The rumours of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria
420	422	and are absolutely false.
422	427	I repeat, these rumours are absolutely false.
427	431	The ship, designed for travel outside the Earth's atmosphere,
431	436	landed in Washington today at 3.47pm Eastern Standard Time.
437	439	We still do not know where it came from.
440	443	The ship is now resting exactly where it landed two hours ago,
443	446	and so far there is no sign of life from inside it.
447	450	Troops have been rushed across the Potomac River from Fort Myer
451	453	and have thrown a cordon around the ship.
453	456	They are supported by tanks, artillery and machine guns.
456	460	Behind the police lines there's a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.
460	465	The army has taken every precaution to meet any emergency which may develop.
466	470	Every eye, every weapon is trained on the ship.
470	474	It's been that way for two hours, and the tension is just beginning...
475	478	Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen. I think something is happening.
541	545	We have come to visit you in peace, and with goodwill.
596	633	(screaming)
716	718	Gort! Deglet ovrosco!
738	741	It was a gift for your president.
741	744	With this, he could have studied life on the other planets.
751	752	Get that ambulance over here.
752	755	Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.
756	758	Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.
758	760	- General. - Right in there, Mr Harley.
775	779	My name is Harley, secretary to the president.
779	784	I've been told you speak our language, and that your name is Mr... Klaatu?
784	786	Just Klaatu.
786	789	The president conveys his deepest apologies for what happened.
789	791	Sit down, Mr Harley.
791	793	Thank you.
797	802	I'm sure I need hardly point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.
802	804	Had you been travelling long?
804	807	About five months. Your months.
807	809	You must have come a long way.
810	812	About 250 million of your miles.
815	818	Naturally, we are very curious to know where you come from.
818	820	From another planet.
820	822	Let's just say that we're neighbours.
822	825	It's hard for us to think of a planet as a neighbour.
825	829	In the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
829	832	- The present situation? - I mean the reason for my coming here.
832	835	We're very curious about that, too.
836	839	- Would you care to talk about it? - I'd be glad to.
840	843	Not now, of course, with you alone.
843	846	You'd rather talk personally with the president?
846	852	This is not a personal matter, Mr Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
852	855	I... I'm not sure I understand.
856	861	I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
861	864	I'm afraid that would be a little awkward.
864	866	It's completely without precedent.
866	872	And there are practical considerations - the time involved, the enormous distances.
872	875	I travelled 250 million miles.
875	877	I appreciate that, but...
878	882	I want to be frank with you, Mr... I mean Klaatu.
883	889	Our world at the moment is full of tensions and suspicions.
890	894	In the present international situation, such a meeting would be quite impossible.
894	897	What about your United Nations?
897	899	You know about the United Nations?
899	902	We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years.
903	904	That's how we learned your languages.
904	908	I'm sure you recognise from our broadcasts
908	911	the evil forces that have produced the trouble in our world. Surely...
911	915	I'm not concerned with the internal affairs of your planet.
915	918	My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles.
918	922	It concerns the existence of every last creature on Earth.
922	925	Perhaps if you could explain a little...
925	929	I intend to explain. To all the nations, at the same time.
930	933	How do we proceed, Mr Harley?
935	939	Well, we could call a special meeting of the General Assembly.
940	942	But the UN doesn't represent all the nations.
943	946	Then I suggest a meeting of all the chiefs of state.
946	950	Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down to the same table.
951	954	I don't want to resort to threats, Mr Harley.
954	958	I merely tell you that the future of your planet is at stake.
958	962	I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.
968	972	I will make that recommendation to the president.
974	978	But I must tell you in all honesty, I'm extremely dubious about the results.
979	983	Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
983	987	I have been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.
987	989	Good night, sir.
999	1003	It is now 2am, and the giant robot still hasn't moved.
1004	1007	Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir have failed to budge him,
1007	1011	and metallurgical experts have found his huge body impregnable.
1011	1016	They're now concentrating on the ship itself, so far with no results.
1032	1033	Getting anyplace, Sergeant?
1033	1036	Oh, no, sir. This beats me, sir.
1037	1039	I saw the ramp come through the side of the ship right here.
1039	1042	Now I can't even find a crack.
1044	1047	Oh, Carlson. What's the report?
1047	1052	No luck, sir. We've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.
1054	1057	- What about him? - He's made out of the same stuff.
1057	1060	- Has he moved, Sergeant? - No, sir. Not an inch.
1060	1063	This is the toughest material I ever saw, General.
1063	1066	For hardness and strength, it's out of this world.
1066	1069	I can tell you officially that's where it came from!
1071	1074	The skeletal structure's completely normal.
1075	1079	The tests show the same for major organs - the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
1079	1082	Yeah, and the lungs are the same as ours.
1082	1086	That must mean a similar atmosphere, similar pressure.
1086	1090	- How old do you think he is? - Oh, I'd say 35, 38.
1091	1094	He told me this morning while I was examining him. He's 78.
1094	1097	- Well, I don't believe it. - Life expectancy is 130.
1098	1099	How does he explain that?
1099	1102	Says their medicine's much more advanced.
1102	1107	He was very nice about it, but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
1112	1115	I removed a bullet from that man's arm yesterday.
1115	1116	Well, what about it?
1116	1119	I just examined the wound, and it's healed.
1119	1120	What does he say about it?
1120	1123	Said he put salve on it, stuff he had on him.
1124	1128	- What are you gonna do with it? - Take it downstairs and have it analysed.
1128	1133	Then I don't know whether to just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine.
1136	1139	- Afternoon, Mr Harley. - Good afternoon, gentlemen.
1146	1149	Good afternoon. I'm glad to see you up and around.
1150	1154	- Thank you. Have you any news? - Not very good news, I'm afraid.
1156	1161	The president accepted your suggestion, and cabled the invitations for a meeting.
1164	1166	Let me read you some of the replies.
1170	1173	"The premier wishes to inform the US Government
1173	1177	it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the president,
1177	1179	unless the meeting is held in Moscow."
1181	1185	"The suggestion of the president of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow
1185	1188	would be unacceptable to His Majesty's Government at present."
1189	1193	"Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."
1194	1196	Well, there you have it.
1199	1205	Now you understand more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss it with the president.
1205	1208	I will not speak with any one nation or group of nations.
1208	1212	I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies.
1212	1215	Our problems are very complex, Klaatu.
1215	1218	- You mustn't judge us too harshly. - I can judge only by what I see.
1219	1223	- Your impatience is quite understandable. - I'm impatient with stupidity.
1223	1227	- My people have learned to live without it. - I'm afraid my people haven't.
1228	1230	I am very sorry.
1230	1233	I wish it were otherwise.
1248	1252	Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people,
1253	1257	and become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
1258	1261	Under the circumstances, I'm afraid that's impossible.
1262	1265	I must ask that you don't try to leave the hospital.
1265	1267	Our military people have insisted on this.
1267	1270	I'm sure you understand.
1310	1314	- The man from the spaceship got away! - What? Get every available man.
1350	1355	(reporter) Hospital authorities refuse to comment on how he managed to escape...
1355	1358	(reporter #2) The descriptions of the creature
1358	1360	are denounced as rumour by the police chief.
1361	1364	He's not eight feet tall, as reported, nor does he have tentacles...
1365	1367	(reporter #3) There's no denying a monster is at large,
1367	1371	and we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power.
1372	1375	The public is advised to take ordinary precautions
1376	1377	and to remain calm as we await...
1377	1380	(reporter #4) Officials have concluded
1380	1383	that this ship comes from some other planet.
1384	1388	Thus far, scientists have refused to speak officially on just which planet,
1388	1390	until they've had an opportunity to study the ship.
1390	1392	They seem to agree, however,
1392	1395	that either Venus or Mars is the most likely possibility.
1396	1401	Not only are these the closest planets to Earth, but all research to date indicates
1401	1405	they are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it.
1405	1410	However, all reputable scientists warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.
1410	1413	Professor Havemeyer of MIT, for example,
1413	1417	points out it's possible, in light of our meagre knowledge.
1417	1419	The president has urged all citizens to be
1419	1422	on the alert for any information about this man,
1422	1424	and to transmit such information immediately
1424	1428	to the police, the army or the FBI.
1428	1431	While the president made no effort to minimise the crisis,
1431	1434	he urged people all over the country to remain calm.
1435	1439	And I might add, that though this man may be our bitter enemy,
1439	1442	he could be also a new-found friend.
1442	1447	- Unfortunately, the only photos we have... - Mom, do you think I could...?
1447	1450	- Hey, who's that? ...do not show the man's face.
1450	1455	The president said the entire facilities of the FBI and every other federal agency
1455	1456	are being brought to bear.
1457	1461	He pointed out, however, that this is no ordinary manhunt.
1461	1467	He warned "We may be up against powers that are beyond our control..."
1475	1480	- What is it you want? - My name is Carpenter. I need a room.
1480	1483	- Oh, I see. - Are you an FBI man?
1484	1486	No, I'm afraid not.
1486	1488	I'll bet he is. He's looking for the spaceman.
1488	1491	We've all been hearing too much about spacemen.
1491	1494	- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter. - How do you do?
1494	1496	And little Bobby.
1496	1500	- Mr and Mrs Barley. And Mr Krull. - How do you do?
1500	1502	And I'm Mrs Crockett.
1503	1508	I have a very nice room on the second floor. It gets the sun all day long.
1509	1512	Can I help you look for the spaceman? I know what he looks like.
1512	1514	He's got a big square head with three eyes.
1514	1518	That's enough, Bobby. It's late. Excuse me.
1518	1522	We mustn't annoy Mr Carpenter, or he won't want to stay here.
1522	1526	He's really a dear little boy, and quiet as a mouse.
1527	1531	- You're a long way from home, aren't you? - How did you know?
1531	1534	Oh. I can tell a New England accent a mile away.
1538	1542	(radio) Now we take you to Miami Beach, Florida, for a report from Gabriel Heatter.
1542	1544	Mr Heatter?
1544	1547	(Heatter) And now on this Sunday morning we ask some questions
1547	1551	that have been haunting the entire nation for two whole days.
1551	1556	This creature: Where is he? What is he up to?
1556	1559	If he can build a spaceship that can fly to Earth,
1559	1563	and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns,
1563	1566	what other terrors can he unleash at will?
1567	1570	Obviously, the monster must be found.
1570	1572	He must be tracked down like a wild animal.
1572	1574	He must be destroyed.
1574	1577	But where would such a creature hide?
1577	1580	Would he disappear into the north woods?
1580	1584	Would he crawl into the sewers of some great city?
1584	1588	Everybody agrees there is grave danger.
1588	1592	The question remains: What can we do to protect ourselves?
1592	1597	What measures can we take to neutralise this menace from another world?
1597	1600	Destroy it? Of course, but how?
1601	1605	And if we do destroy it, what do we face in retaliation?
1606	1608	- It's not a simple problem... - George, turn it off.
1608	1610	I'm trying to concentrate.
1610	1613	Why doesn't the government do something?
1613	1616	What can they do? They're only people, like us.
1616	1618	People, my foot! They're Democrats.
1618	1620	It gives you the shakes.
1620	1624	He's got that robot standing there, just waiting for orders to destroy us.
1624	1629	This spaceman, or whatever he is. We automatically assume he's a menace.
1630	1632	- Maybe he isn't at all. - Then what's he hiding for?
1632	1636	- Why doesn't he come out in the open? - Like Heatter says, "What's he up to?"
1636	1639	- Maybe he's afraid. - He's afraid!
1639	1643	Well, after all, he was shot the minute he landed here.
1644	1648	- I was just wondering what I would do. - Perhaps before deciding on any action,
1649	1653	you'd want to know more about the people, to orient yourself in a strange environment.
1653	1657	There's nothing strange about Washington.
1657	1659	A person from another planet may disagree.
1659	1663	If you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth.
1663	1665	And you know where I mean.
1666	1669	They wouldn't come in a spaceship. Only planes.
1669	1671	I wouldn't be too sure about that.
1672	1675	That fellow wants something, otherwise he wouldn't be here.
1675	1677	That right, Mr Carpenter?
1677	1680	I'm a little confused.
1680	1683	Oh, Mrs Benson, Mr Stevens is here to see you.
1683	1685	Oh, thank you. Excuse me.
1685	1689	George, finish your coffee. I promised the Carsons I'd be there at 11.
1691	1694	- Good morning. - Good morning.
1694	1699	We're set. I put gas in the car and the radio's broken,
1699	1700	so we can forget about the spaceman.
1700	1703	There's one thing. I haven't anyone to stay with Bobby.
1704	1705	I don't suppose we could take him with us?
1705	1708	Well... Well, we could.
1708	1711	There's always someone here, but today they've all got plans.
1711	1713	I haven't any plans.
1714	1717	I'd be happy to spend the day with him, if you'd let me.
1717	1720	Say, that would be great. Wouldn't it?
1721	1723	It's awfully nice of you to suggest it.
1723	1727	- Sorry. Mr Carpenter, this is Tom Stevens. - How do you do, Mr Carpenter?
1727	1729	Hello.
1729	1731	Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday afternoon.
1731	1733	We talked and listened to the radio.
1734	1737	I thought today he might like to show me around the city.
1738	1739	Well...
1739	1741	Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?
1742	1743	Fine.
1745	1747	- You think it's all right? - Sure.
1761	1764	That's my father. He was killed at Anzio.
1782	1784	Did all those people die in wars?
1784	1787	Most of 'em. Didn't you ever hear of the Arlington Cemetery?
1788	1789	No, I'm afraid not.
1789	1792	You don't seem to know much of anything.
1792	1797	Well, I'll tell you, Bobby, I've been away a long time. Very far away.
1797	1800	Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
1800	1803	They have cemeteries, but not like this one.
1803	1806	You see, they don't have any wars.
1806	1808	Gee, that's a good idea.
1809	1812	- What would you like to do? - Go to the movies.
1812	1814	- All right. - No fooling?
1814	1816	No fooling.
1817	1821	Bobby, tell me, do you have to have money to go there?
1821	1826	- I've got two dollars. Mom gave it to me. - No. I want to take you to the movie.
1827	1829	Do you think they'd accept these?
1831	1833	Gee, they look like diamonds!
1833	1836	In some places, those are what people use for money.
1836	1838	They're easier to carry and don't wear out.
1838	1840	I'll bet they're worth a million dollars.
1841	1843	Would you give me your $2 for two of these?
1843	1845	Well...
1845	1846	Sure.
1847	1848	OK.
1850	1853	Let's not say anything to Mom about this, though.
1853	1857	- Why not, Bobby? - She doesn't like me to steal from people.
1881	1883	Those are great words.
1885	1888	- He must have been a great man. - Well, sure.
1901	1904	That's the kind of man I'd like to talk to.
1906	1909	Bobby, who's the greatest man in America today?
1909	1911	I don't know. The spaceman, I guess.
1912	1917	No, I was speaking of earthmen. I meant the greatest philosopher or thinker.
1917	1920	- You mean the smartest man in the world? - Yes, that would do nicely.
1921	1924	Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist.
1924	1928	- He lives here in Washington, doesn't he? - Near where Mom works.
1928	1929	- Where's that? - Department of Commerce.
1929	1931	She's a secretary.
1931	1935	That man they call the secretary isn't at all. My mom's a real secretary.
1936	1939	Mr Carpenter, now can we go see the spaceship?
1940	1942	If you like.
1956	1959	I'll bet that iron guy's strong and could knock down a whole building.
1960	1962	I shouldn't be at all surprised.
1962	1967	I'd like to get inside that ship, see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
1967	1971	A highly developed form of atomic power, I should imagine.
1971	1973	I thought that was only for bombs.
1973	1976	No. No, it's for lots of other things, too.
1976	1979	Do you think it can go faster than the F-86?
1979	1980	Yes, I should think so.
1980	1984	- About 1,000 miles an hour? - Maybe 4,000 miles an hour.
1984	1987	And outside the Earth's atmosphere, a good deal faster.
1988	1990	How could they make a landing?
1990	1992	There are several ways to reduce landing speed.
1993	1997	You see, the basic problem is to overcome the inertia...
1997	1999	Keep going, mister. He was fallin' for it!
2005	2006	Thank you, Mrs Robinson.
2006	2009	I'm sure we've all shared your fears during the past few days.
2009	2014	I see a gentleman here with his little boy. What do you think of the spaceship, son?
2014	2017	It's the biggest spaceship I ever saw.
2017	2021	- And you, sir. Mind telling us your name? - My name is Carpenter.
2021	2026	Care to say a few words? I suppose you're just as scared as the rest of us.
2026	2027	In a different way, perhaps.
2027	2032	I am fearful when I see people substituting fear for reason. In fact, I would...
2032	2035	Uh, thank you, Mr Carpenter. Thank you very much.
2035	2037	I see another gentleman in the crowd...
2037	2041	Extra! Extra! Spaceman eludes police! Army put in charge.
2041	2044	Read all about it! Spaceman eludes police!
2044	2046	Extra! Extra!
2048	2051	Get your paper here. Army put in charge.
2051	2053	Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
2053	2055	You think they'll ever find him?
2055	2059	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
2059	2062	Mr Carpenter, what is inertia?
2062	2065	The property of matter by which it remains in uniform motion
2065	2068	unless acted upon by external force.
2068	2069	Oh.
2069	2073	I'll bet that's just the way Professor Barnhardt talks.
2073	2075	Bobby, I have an idea.
2076	2080	- Let's go and find out how Barnhardt talks. - You're kidding!
2081	2085	- Wouldn't you like to meet him? - Sure I would, but I bet you'd be scared.
2085	2088	Maybe we can scare him more than he can scare us.
2089	2092	I like you, Mr Carpenter. You're a real screwball.
2095	2098	(newsboy) Extra! Extra! Spaceman still at large.
2099	2103	Extra! Read all about it. Get your paper here.
2113	2115	Maybe he isn't home.
2122	2124	Gee, I'll bet you this is where he works.
2146	2148	What's that stuff on the blackboard mean?
2149	2151	It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
2151	2154	I'll bet he's the only one that knows the answer.
2154	2157	He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
2161	2164	We probably couldn't get to see him even if he was home.
2167	2169	(door opens)
2170	2172	Hey, where are you going?
2172	2175	If he's that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.
2191	2192	Did he do it wrong?
2193	2195	He just needs a little help.
2209	2211	What are you doing in here?
2213	2216	How dare you write on that blackboard!
2216	2220	Do you realise the professor's worked on that problem for weeks?
2220	2222	He'll solve it in no time now.
2223	2226	- How did you get in? What do you want? - To see Professor Barnhardt.
2226	2230	Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.
2235	2237	I think you'd better leave now.
2244	2247	Would you give this to the professor?
2247	2249	I think he'll want to talk to me.
2262	2265	I wouldn't erase that. The professor needs it very badly.
2292	2294	(rings doorbell)
2298	2301	- Mr Carpenter come home yet? - Yeah, he's inside.
2301	2304	- Tell him I'd like to see him. - OK. Come on in.
2308	2311	- Your name Carpenter? - Yes.
2311	2315	- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me? - I've been looking for you all afternoon.
2323	2325	Thank you.
2328	2332	- It was a wonderful day. - You still haven't answered my question.
2332	2337	You know how I feel, Tom, but I just want to think it over.
2338	2340	Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow.
2340	2343	If I could tell him I was marrying and had dependants...
2343	2347	You're a good salesman, but I've got to think about it.
2347	2352	A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think about it.
2353	2356	- Good night. - Night.
2364	2366	- Hiya, Mom. - Hello, darling.
2366	2369	- Good evening, Mr Carpenter. - Good evening.
2369	2373	- Uh, Mrs Benson, this is Mr Brady. - How do you do?
2373	2375	Mr Brady's a government agent!
2378	2381	- Have a nice day, dear? - We had a swell time, didn't we?
2381	2382	Yes.
2382	2386	We went to the movies and had ice-cream cones, and then we went to see Daddy.
2387	2390	- I don't know how to thank you. - I enjoyed every minute of it.
2391	2393	We better get going, Mr Carpenter.
2395	2397	Aw, gee, you didn't finish your story.
2398	2400	I'll finish it tomorrow. Good night, Bobby.
2400	2402	- Good night. - Good night.
2411	2413	Come on, dear. Time to go to bed.
2415	2418	Why did Mr Carpenter have to go with Mr Brady?
2418	2420	I don't know. Maybe it was a mistake.
2420	2422	Oh.
2423	2426	We sure had fun today. We saw the spaceship
2426	2428	and we went to see Professor Barnhardt.
2428	2430	- Professor Barnhardt? - Yeah, sure.
2430	2434	Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
2434	2435	Yes, of course, dear.
2435	2438	Gee. I was hoping I could go out with Mr Carpenter again.
2442	2444	(doorbell)
2447	2449	Oh, come in. The professor's in his study.
2449	2451	Thank you.
2456	2459	(knocks)
2460	2463	This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.
2463	2466	- Thank you, Captain. - I'll wait outside.
2468	2472	- You wrote this? - It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.
2472	2475	But I understand you're a difficult man to see.
2475	2479	- I thought you'd have the solution by now. - Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
2479	2483	All you have to do now is to substitute this expression at this point.
2483	2486	That will reproduce the first-order term.
2486	2488	But what about the effect of the other terms?
2488	2492	Almost negligible. With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
2492	2496	How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
2497	2501	I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.
2504	2506	I am Klaatu.
2508	2512	I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.
2512	2515	My doctor's name was Major White.
2516	2520	If you're not interested or if you intend to turn me over to your army,
2520	2522	we needn't waste any more time.
2532	2535	You may go now, Captain. Please thank General Cutler,
2535	2538	and tell him... tell him that I know this gentleman.
2541	2543	You have faith.
2543	2547	It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr Klaatu. It's curiosity.
2547	2549	Sit down, please.
2549	2554	There are several thousand questions I'd like to ask you.
2555	2557	I'd like to explain something of my mission.
2557	2559	That was my first question.
2559	2562	We know from observation that your planet
2562	2565	has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.
2565	2568	And that you're experimenting with rockets.
2568	2570	Yes, that is true.
2571	2573	While you were limited to fighting among yourselves
2573	2576	with primitive tanks and aircraft,
2576	2578	we were unconcerned.
2578	2582	But soon one of your nations will apply atomic energy to spaceships.
2582	2587	That will create a threat to the peace and security of other planets.
2587	2589	That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
2589	2592	What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr Klaatu?
2593	2596	I came here to warn you that by threatening danger,
2596	2600	your planet faces danger, very grave danger.
2600	2605	- I'm prepared, however, to offer a solution. - Would you care to be more specific?
2605	2608	What I have to say must be said to all concerned.
2609	2613	It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
2619	2622	I gather that your efforts on the official level were not successful.
2622	2627	I come to you as a last resort, and I confess my patience is wearing thin.
2627	2630	Must I take drastic action to get a hearing?
2630	2633	What... what sort of action do you mean?
2633	2637	Violent action, since that seems to be the only thing your people understand.
2637	2642	Levelling New York City perhaps, or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.
2650	2653	Would you meet with the group of scientists I'm calling together?
2653	2656	You could explain your mission to them
2656	2658	and they, in turn, could present it to their peoples.
2658	2661	That's why I came to see you.
2661	2663	It is not enough to have men of science.
2664	2667	We scientists are too often ignored or misunderstood.
2668	2672	We must get leaders from every field - the finest minds in the world.
2672	2674	I leave that in your hands.
2676	2678	One thing, Mr Klaatu.
2678	2683	Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
2683	2686	I'm afraid there is no alternative.
2686	2689	In such a case, the planet Earth would have to be...
2689	2691	eliminated.
2691	2694	Such power exists?
2694	2697	I assure you, such power exists.
2699	2703	The people who come to the meeting must be made to realise this.
2703	2705	They must understand what is at stake.
2707	2709	- You mentioned a demonstration of force. - Yes.
2710	2712	Would one be possible before the meeting?
2712	2713	Yes, of course.
2713	2718	Something to dramatise for them and their people the seriousness of the situation.
2718	2722	- Something to affect the entire planet. - That can easily be arranged.
2722	2725	I wouldn't want you to harm anybody or destroy anything.
2725	2728	Leave it to me. I'll think of something.
2728	2731	Maybe a little demonstration.
2732	2735	Something dramatic, but not destructive.
2737	2739	That's quite an interesting problem.
2739	2743	Would the day after tomorrow be all right, say about noon?
2752	2754	(radio) There are no further developments,
2754	2756	but police and the FBI are tracing
2756	2759	every possible clue and rounding up all suspects...
2759	2761	- Rummy! - Oh, my.
2761	2763	Did it again!
2763	2767	- Take a hand, Mr Carpenter? - Take a...? Oh.
2767	2770	No, thanks. We don't... No, thanks.
2771	2774	- Are you going out, dear? - Yes. Tom's picking me up.
2774	2778	Personally, I wouldn't go out after dark these days.
2778	2781	But then I'm not courting, am I?
2785	2786	Oh!
2787	2789	Oh, Mr Carpenter.
2795	2797	Everyone seems so...
2798	2800	"Jittery" is the word.
2802	2805	Bobby's the only person I know who isn't... jittery.
2805	2808	He has his homework to keep him occupied.
2808	2812	- He's a fine boy, Mrs Benson. - Naturally, I think so.
2812	2814	Warm, friendly, intelligent.
2816	2818	Mr Carpenter...
2818	2823	This is none of my business, but why did that man come here last night?
2823	2825	Theyjust wanted to ask me a few questions.
2826	2830	Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon. He wasn't in.
2830	2834	Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
2834	2836	(doorbell)
2836	2838	Excuse me.
2843	2845	(tinkling melody)
2847	2849	- Hello. - Hello. Are you ready?
2849	2852	- In a minute. - The picture starts at 8.50.
2852	2855	- I was with Mr Carpenter. - I hope he won't think I'm intruding.
2856	2857	- Sh! - What...
2858	2862	Good evening. Excuse me, I was just going up to my room.
2862	2866	- Good night, Mr Carpenter. - Have a good time, both of you.
2866	2868	(both) Thank you.
2868	2872	Why don't you wait in here while I get my things? Tom, that was awful.
2872	2874	I'm just tired of hearing
2874	2875	- about Mr Carpenter. - Tom!
2876	2878	I don't like how he's attached himself to you and Bobby.
2878	2880	What do you know about him?
2882	2884	I'll go get my things.
2899	2903	All you have to remember is first find the common denominator, and then divide.
2903	2905	Thanks, Mr Carpenter.
2907	2910	- I'll say good night again. - Mr Carpenter...
2910	2912	I...
2913	2916	- Good night. - Good night, Mrs Benson.
2918	2920	Bed now. You can finish that in the morning.
2920	2921	OK.
2925	2927	Bobby.
2928	2932	I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr Carpenter.
2933	2937	Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend, and he's awful good in arithmetic.
2937	2939	He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
2940	2942	Did you really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
2942	2945	Sure we did. He wasn't there, but we went to see him.
2945	2948	And Mr Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
2950	2954	Mom, is something wrong with Mr Carpenter?
2954	2956	- What do you mean, dear? - On account of last night.
2957	2960	You think he's a bank robber, or a gangster maybe?
2960	2964	No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man.
2965	2968	I just think that he might prefer to be left alone, that's all.
2968	2971	Now you go to bed and forget about it.
2971	2973	- Good night, darling. - Good night.
2975	2977	Mom?
2978	2980	Why would he wanna be left alone?
2981	2983	Don't forget to brush your teeth.
3006	3009	(train whistle blows)
3011	3014	- Bobby, have you a flashlight? - Yeah.
3018	3020	- It's a real Boy Scout one. - Fine.
3023	3026	- Here. All you gotta do is push up on it. - Oh.
3026	3030	- What do you need it for? - I've, uh... The light in my room went out.
3030	3031	Oh.
3031	3035	I must tell you sometime about a kind of train that doesn't need any tracks.
3035	3037	- Really? - Really.
3037	3040	- Remind me in the morning to tell you. - OK.
3051	3053	No tracks.
3298	3300	Gort! Baringa!
3403	3406	(alien language)
3420	3422	(Mrs Benson) Come in for a minute.
3423	3427	- Bobby, what are you doing up? - I couldn't sleep. I had to tell you.
3427	3430	- Tell me what? - After you left, I followed Mr Carpenter,
3430	3433	and where do you think he went? Right into the spaceship!
3433	3436	- Now, Bobby, wait a minute. - Honest, Mom. I saw him.
3436	3441	It opened up and he walked in. That big iron fella was walking around, too.
3441	3444	- Bobby, you've been dreaming again. - No, I haven't, Mom.
3444	3446	Honest. I promise you, I saw him!
3447	3451	- Where'd you see all this? - On the lawn down at the Mall.
3451	3455	- In that place with the soldiers out in front. - Where were the soldiers?
3455	3457	That big iron guy grabbed 'em and knocked 'em out.
3458	3461	I like Mr Carpenter, Mom, but I'm kinda scared.
3461	3463	Don't be frightened. It was only a bad dream.
3464	3465	Here, we'll prove it to you.
3465	3468	- Tom, ask Mr Carpenter to come down. - Sure.
3468	3470	- He's in the room next to mine. - OK.
3472	3475	Think back. You didn't follow Mr Carpenter at all, did you?
3475	3477	You haven't even been outside.
3477	3479	- Yes, I have! - You didn't really see a spaceship,
3479	3483	- but you thought you did. - I'd never call you a liar.
3531	3535	He's not there, but look what I found in his room.
3535	3538	- Is it real? - It looks real to me.
3538	3542	Mr Carpenter's got lots of diamonds. He gave me a couple of 'em.
3543	3546	- He gave these to you? - Well, not exactly.
3546	3549	I gave him two dollars.
3549	3552	This doesn't make sense.
3552	3557	- I think he's a crook. I never did trust him. - Gee, you think he's a diamond smuggler?
3557	3560	- You're going to bed now. - I wonder if we...
3560	3563	Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
3563	3567	- Do you think it's all right to stay here? - I've got a good lock on my door.
3567	3572	Bobby's gonna sleep in my room tonight. Come on now, up to bed with you.
3572	3574	Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
3574	3576	Yeah. The grass was kinda wet.
3584	3586	- I'm going now, Helen. - All right.
3599	3602	- Hello. - May I see you for a minute?
3602	3605	- Well, I'm just going to lunch. - May I walk out with you?
3605	3607	- Well... - (phone rings)
3612	3614	Mrs Benson speaking.
3615	3616	Oh, hello.
3616	3620	I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond. Can we lunch together?
3620	3622	Can I talk to you later?
3622	3625	Oh, that'll be fine. Bye.
3637	3639	I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school.
3639	3640	Yes?
3640	3642	I'd like to know what he told you last night.
3643	3647	I really didn't pay much attention. Bobby has such an active imagination.
3647	3648	Did you believe what he told you?
3650	3653	I have a reason for asking this. A very important reason.
3656	3659	There's another elevator we can use.
3670	3674	- What is it you want? - Before I ask you to be honest with me,
3674	3677	perhaps I should be completely honest with you.
3678	3680	- What happened? - What time is it?
3683	3684	Just 12.00.
3685	3688	We shall be here for a little while. About 30 minutes.
3690	3693	- We can try pushing the other buttons. - They won't work.
3695	3696	Why not?
3696	3699	You see, the electricity's been neutralised...
3699	3701	all over the world.
3702	3705	Bobby was telling the truth, wasn't he?
3705	3707	Yes.
3735	3738	It's that spaceman. That's what it is.
3743	3745	(mutters in French)
3749	3751	(mutters in Russian)
3806	3809	You should see it! You should go out and see it for yourself!
3809	3812	Thanks. I am enjoying it right here.
3812	3815	The city has stopped. People are running around like ants.
3815	3818	What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
3819	3823	The people who are coming to the meeting tonight, have they arrived?
3823	3827	Yes. I talked to them on the phone. They're all very curious about the meeting.
3828	3830	Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr Carpenter?
3830	3832	He'll be there at 8.30.
3833	3838	Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you? Does it make you feel insecure?
3838	3842	- Yes, sir. It certainly does. - That's good, Hilda.
3842	3844	I'm glad.
3846	3850	As far as we can tell, power's been cut off everywhere, with a few exceptions.
3850	3852	And even these exceptions are remarkable -
3852	3854	hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.
3855	3859	I wish I could tell you more but, as you know, all communications are out -
3859	3863	telephones, radio, cable, everything.
3865	3871	I can tell you the president is prepared to declare a state of national emergency.
3878	3883	- Eleanor, did you call the electrician? - I tried, but the phone doesn't work either.
3883	3887	- Well, call the phone company. - But the phone doesn't work!
3890	3892	Is it worth anything?
3892	3894	I have never seen such a stone in all my life.
3894	3898	- Will you tell me where it came from? - That's what I want you to tell me.
3898	3902	But there are no diamonds like this anyplace in the world that I know of.
3902	3906	- Are you sure of that? - Uh, would you like to sell it?
3906	3908	No. No, thanks.
3908	3911	- I'd give you a very good price. - Thank you, no.
3913	3915	I've told you more than I told Barnhardt
3915	3919	because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.
3919	3925	I thought if you knew the facts, you'd see the importance of the meeting tonight.
3925	3928	Of course. Of course I do.
3929	3933	- You hold great hope for this meeting. - I can see no other hope for your planet.
3934	3938	If this meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
3939	3941	It must be 12.30.
3943	3945	Yes.
3945	3947	Just exactly.
3950	3952	(horns blaring)
3968	3971	- Where are you going now? - The boarding house.
3971	3974	I'll be safe there for today. I can watch Bobby.
3974	3976	He's the only other person who knows...
3976	3978	- No, wait. There's someone else. - Who?
3978	3981	Tom. He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
3981	3983	Do you think he'd tell anyone?
3983	3986	I think he'd talk to me first anyway, before...
3988	3993	Well, we can't take any chance. I'll get in touch with him right away to make sure.
3995	3999	But I've got to talk to him. It's important. When is he coming back?
3999	4001	I don't know, Mrs Benson.
4001	4004	He left before noon, before that awful electric business.
4004	4007	I'm scared to death, Mrs Benson. I...
4007	4010	No, he wouldn't tell me where he was going.
4010	4012	He said it was something personal.
4012	4015	Well, please ask him to call me the minute he gets in.
4015	4017	Thanks.
4020	4025	Before we discuss plans, I want a report from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot?
4025	4028	When it was discovered that the robot had moved,
4028	4031	I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilising him.
4032	4036	We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of KL93,
4036	4039	a new plastic material stronger than steel.
4039	4042	- Isn't it possible he's broken out? - No, sir. We just checked on that.
4043	4044	He's locked up tight as a drum.
4044	4047	All right. Now we concentrate on the man.
4047	4051	Up till now we've agreed upon the desirability of capturing this man alive.
4051	4054	We can no longer afford to be so particular.
4054	4058	We'll get him, alive if possible, but we must get him.
4058	4061	- Is that clear? - (all) Yes, sir.
4097	4099	Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't sit still.
4099	4104	I'd like to run someplace, but I don't know where to go. Bye now.
4104	4108	Margaret, call the Pentagon. Find out who's in charge of this spaceman business.
4108	4110	Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.
4110	4113	Mrs Benson called. She says it's important.
4113	4115	Get this other call first.
4120	4123	- Oh, Mrs Benson, he just walked in. - Fine.
4123	4125	- Are you nervous, too? - Yes, I am.
4125	4129	- Helen, come on in. - I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
4130	4133	I have some terrific news about Mr Carpenter.
4133	4135	- What about him? - He's the spaceman.
4135	4140	I had that diamond checked at three places. Nobody's ever seen a stone like that.
4140	4143	After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me.
4143	4146	Why is it nobody knows about him? Why hasn't he got money?
4146	4149	All right, Tom, it's true. I know it's true.
4149	4152	- You... How do you know? - Never mind about that.
4152	4154	Promise you won't say a word to anybody.
4154	4156	After what happened today?
4156	4160	- You don't realise how important this is. - Of course it's important.
4160	4161	And we can do something about it.
4161	4164	That's what I'm saying. We must do nothing.
4165	4166	Believe me.
4166	4168	He's a menace. It's our duty to turn him in.
4168	4172	But he isn't a menace. He told me why he came here.
4172	4174	He told... He told you?
4175	4178	Oh, don't be silly, honey, just because you like the guy.
4178	4180	You realise what this'd mean to us?
4180	4185	- I'd be the biggest man in the country. - Is that what you're thinking about?
4185	4187	- Somebody has to get rid of him. - (phone)
4188	4189	I won't let you do it.
4189	4191	- Yes? - This is important...
4191	4193	What's his name, Margaret?
4193	4196	General Cutler. Yes. Oh, all right, I'll hold on.
4196	4198	You mustn't.
4198	4200	It isn't just you and Mr Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved.
4200	4203	I don't care about the rest of the world.
4206	4209	You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
4209	4213	- I feel different now. - You wait. You're gonna marry a big hero.
4213	4217	- I'm not going to marry anybody. - Helen, I... Hello, General Cutler?
4217	4220	No, I don't want to speak to his aide. I want to speak to the general.
4221	4223	Tell him it's about the spaceman.
4232	4235	That's right. That's where he's staying.
4235	4238	- Yes, of course I'm sure. - Thank you, Mr Stevens.
4238	4241	I'll want to talk to you further, but I haven't time now.
4241	4245	Deploy all Zone Five units according to Plan B. Immediately!
4293	4295	- Hello, Mrs Benson. - Hello, Sammy.
4304	4308	Attention, all units. Attention, all units.
4308	4310	When deployed according to Plan Baker,
4310	4315	maintain station and remain on radio alert until further orders.
4366	4369	I'm sure Barnhardt can hide me until the meeting.
4369	4372	- Where's the meeting going to be? - At the ship.
4374	4378	Yeah, they got in a taxicab and went off down that street.
4378	4380	Thank you, son.
4382	4385	Attention, Zone Five. Attention, Zone Five.
4385	4389	Yellow cab moving north on 14th Street from Harvard Street.
4389	4392	Man and woman in back seat. Get licence number and report.
4401	4403	That's the one!
4406	4413	Right. Attention, Zone Five. Licence number of target vehicle is H0012.
4413	4416	Hey. Looks like something big's going on.
4427	4432	Attention, Zone Five. Report when target vehicle passes your position.
4448	4452	- It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's. - I'm worried about Gort.
4452	4456	I'm afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me.
4456	4460	Gort? But he's a robot. Without you, what could he do?
4460	4462	There's no limit to what he could do.
4462	4464	He could destroy the Earth.
4467	4471	If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort.
4471	4472	You must say these words:
4473	4476	Klaatu barada nikto.
4476	4478	Please repeat that.
4479	4481	Klaatu...
4481	4483	barada nikto.
4483	4485	You must remember those words.
4487	4489	(murmurs) Klaatu
4489	4491	barada
4491	4492	nikto.
4496	4502	Yellow cab, licence number H0012, heading west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.
4508	4511	The target vehicle is turning west into Massachusetts Avenue.
4515	4517	Yellow cab at Columbia Road and Connecticut.
4517	4521	Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.
4522	4525	Attention, all units, northwest area, Zone Five.
4525	4528	Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut Avenue
4528	4531	on a line from Wisconsin to the park.
4531	4533	All vehicles close in.
4533	4534	Let's go.
4572	4575	Say, what's going on here?
4576	4578	Drive...
4593	4597	Get that message to Gort... right away.
4619	4622	- Captain, hold these people back. - Yes, sir.
4622	4626	See if they have a stretcher at the police station. Take him there.
4791	4792	Gort.
4792	4802	Klaatu barada nikto.
4933	4937	Yes, sir. Yes, we have the body here now, locked in a cell.
4938	4941	There's no question about it, General. He's dead all right.
4942	4945	I understand. I'll be right there, sir.
4946	4949	Bring in a squad of men. Place a guard around that cell.
4949	4952	- Captain, don't let anyone in or out of here. - Yes, sir.
4952	4954	Come along.
5076	5078	- Professor Barnhardt? - Yes.
5078	5081	I'm very sorry, but I have to ask you to call off this meeting.
5081	5084	Call it off? But I had permission from the army.
5084	5088	I know, sir, but the robot's on the loose, and it's not safe.
5088	5090	You have to get your people out.
5090	5092	(electronic humming)
5106	5108	(humming crescendoes)
5134	5137	(humming stops)
5184	5186	Hello.
5187	5188	I...
5188	5191	I thought you were...
5191	5193	I was.
5195	5197	You mean...
5198	5200	he has the power of life and death?
5200	5204	No. That power is reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
5204	5208	This technique, in some cases, can restore life for a limited period.
5208	5210	But... how long?
5210	5212	You mean, how long will I live?
5213	5215	That, no one can tell.
5229	5235	Under the circumstances, the army people have asked us to leave.
5236	5240	And, since their concern is for our safety,
5240	5244	I can do nothing but suggest that we comply.
5278	5282	I am leaving soon, and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.
5284	5287	The universe grows smaller every day,
5287	5293	and the threat of aggression by any group anywhere can no longer be tolerated.
5293	5298	There must be security for all, or no one is secure.
5299	5305	This does not mean giving up any freedom, except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
5306	5310	Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves,
5311	5313	and hired policemen to enforce them.
5313	5318	We of the other planets have long accepted this principle.
5318	5323	We have an organisation for the mutual protection of all planets,
5323	5326	and for the complete elimination of aggression.
5327	5333	The test of any such higher authority is, of course, the police force that supports it.
5333	5337	For our policemen, we created a race of robots.
5338	5342	Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one,
5343	5345	and preserve the peace.
5345	5350	In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.
5350	5353	This power cannot be revoked.
5353	5358	At the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor.
5359	5363	The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.
5365	5368	The result is, we live in peace,
5368	5369	without arms or armies,
5370	5373	secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war,
5374	5377	free to pursue more profitable enterprises.
5378	5382	We do not pretend to have achieved perfection,
5382	5385	but we do have a system, and it works.
5387	5389	I came here to give you these facts.
5390	5394	It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
5394	5398	But if you threaten to extend your violence,
5398	5402	this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.
5405	5407	Your choice is simple.
5407	5410	Join us and live in peace,
5410	5414	or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
5416	5419	We shall be waiting for your answer.
5419	5422	The decision rests with you.
5442	5444	Gort! Baringa.
5471	5473	(murmurs of confusion)
5473	5475	(screaming)
