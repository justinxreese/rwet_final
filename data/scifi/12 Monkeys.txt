735	738	Of course, they figured he's stoned out of his mind.
738	740	Some kind of psychotic episode.
740	743	He's been tested for drugs? Negative for drugs.
743	747	But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.
747	750	No drugs. You believe that? He's in restraints.
751	756	Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? l've got two police officers in the hospital!
756	761	The medic gave him enough Stelazine to kill a horse. Look at him. Rarin' to go.

823	825	Do you think you can do that, James?
827	828	May l call you James?

864	868	You don't remember assaulting a police officer?
868	871	Why am l chained? Why are these chains on me?

910	912	1006.

1038	1041	How much you gonna pay me? How much? l'd be doin' yourjob.
1041	1043	Five thousand dollars, my man. That enough?

1095	1097	Learn your drugs. Know your doses. lt's elementary.
1097	1101	l need to make a telephone call. A telephone call?
1101	1103	That's communication with the outside world.

1146	1148	We're not productive anymore. Don't make things anymore.

1152	1155	Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
1155	1158	But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, what are you then?
1158	1161	What? You're mentally ill!
1161	1162	Fact, Jim. Fact.
1162	1165	lf you don't buy things: toilet paper, new cars,
1165	1167	electrically operated sexual devices,
1167	1169	stereo systems with brain-implanted headphones,
1170	1172	screwdrivers with miniature built-in radar devices,

1173	1177	Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.

1183	1184	(EXCLAIMS)
1185	1189	lf you want to watch a particular television program, like All My Children,
1189	1192	you can go to the charge nurse and tell her the day,
1192	1193	the time the show you wanna see is on.
1193	1195	But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on.
1196	1199	There was this guy and he was always requesting shows that had already played.
1199	1202	Yes. No. You have to tell her before.
1202	1204	He couldn't quite grasp the idea
1204	1206	that the charge nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.
1206	1208	She couldn't turn back time! Thank you, Einstein.
1208	1212	Now he, he was nuts. He was a fruitcake, Jim.
1212	1214	Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.
1214	1216	You're going to get a shot.
1216	1217	l warned you.

1259	1264	But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way,
1265	1269	nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche.
1270	1273	l am mentally divergent

1337	1339	They, they paint this.
1339	1341	They stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere.
1342	1343	Have you seen this?
1343	1345	Mr. Cole? Have you seen this?
1345	1347	Why don't you take your time
1347	1350	and try to explain this from the beginning?

2718	2721	this man appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge
2722	2723	in April of 1362.
2724	2727	Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent,
2727	2730	the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence
2730	2734	which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years.
2735	2739	Obviously, this plague-doomsday scenario is more compelling
2739	2741	when reality supports it with a virulent disease,
2741	2744	whether it's the bubonic plague, smallpox or AIDS.
2745	2748	Now we have technological horrors, such as chemical warfare,
2748	2750	which first reared its ugly head
2750	2752	during the deadly mustard gas attacks of World War l.
2752	2756	During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1017,
2756	2758	we have an account of this soldier,
2758	2760	who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel
2760	2763	and hospitalized, apparently in a state of hysteria.
2764	2767	Doctors found that he had lost all comprehension of French,
2767	2769	but that he spoke English fluently,
2769	2772	albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize.
2772	2776	The man, though physically unaffected by the gas,
2776	2778	was beside himself.
2778	2781	He claimed that he had come from the future,
2781	2784	that he was looking for a pure germ
2784	2786	that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth
2787	2790	starting in the year 1006.

2805	2808	Cassandra in Greek legend was condemned to know the future,

4409	4412	l get it. l see what you're up to. lt's your old plan, isn't it?
4412	4414	What plan? Your plan. Remember?
4414	4416	l don't know what you're talking about.
4416	4419	Yes, you do. We were in the dayroom, watching television
4419	4422	and you were upset about the desecration of the planet, which l understand.
4422	4423	Then you said to me,
4423	4425	"Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or virus
4425	4428	"that would wipe out all of mankind and leave the animals and trees?"
4428	4430	You're trying to confuse me. You were so funny.
4430	4432	l told you my father was this famous virologist.
4432	4435	And you said, "He could make a germ and we could steal it."
4435	4437	Coo-coo-ka-roo, you were.
4437	4440	They mutate! We live underground!
4440	4442	The world belongs to the dogs and cats.
4442	4444	We live like worms.
4445	4447	l just need the information. Take it easy.
4447	4452	You are a total nut-case! Completely deranged! Delusional, paranoid.
4452	4454	Your processor is all fucked up.
4455	4458	Your information tray is jammed, man!
4458	4460	Do you know what it is, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
4460	4463	A collection of space-case do-gooders saving rain forests.
4463	4465	l have nothing to do with those bozos.
4465	4469	l quit being the rich kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!
4469	4472	So much for your grand plot, asshole!
4472	4475	Father's been warning people about the dangers of experimentation
4475	4477	with D.N.A. viruses for years.
4477	4479	You've processed that information
4479	4481	through your addled, paranoid infrastructure.
4481	4484	Lo and behold, a nonprofit organization
4484	4486	becomes some sinister, revolutionary cabal!
4486	4489	This man is complete bat shit!
4489	4493	Ladies and gentlemen, do you realize where he thinks he comes from?
4496	4499	ANNOUNCER: Captain Dan Miller, the man in charge of the rescue operation,
4499	4503	says he has consulted with experts, and they assure us...
4503	4507	lf you ask me, the monkey's going to eat that goddamn sandwich himself.
4507	4510	Did a man just come running through here?
4510	4513	...saying his primary responsibility was to the missing boy.
4515	4519	Police say that the body of a woman found strangled in Knutson State Park
4519	4523	could be kidnapping victim Dr. Kathryn Railly.
4526	4528	Anybody see someone come through here?
4529	4532	...discovered less than an hour ago by hikers.
4532	4535	But we have an unconfirmed report that the victim,
4535	4539	a woman in her late twenties or early thirties, was savagely mutilated.
4539	4543	Earlier in the day, police located Railly's abandoned car.
4543	4544	lt was found not far...
4545	4547	(SCREAMS)
4547	4549	Any sign of him?
4550	4551	Nothing.
4553	4554	He can't just disappear.
4558	4559	(PANTING)
4575	4576	You bastard!
4579	4582	l could've died in there! You son of a bitch!
4582	4583	(CRYING)
4584	4585	What were you thinking of,
4585	4588	you twisted sack of shit?
4589	4592	COLE: l'm sorry. Sorry l locked you in the trunk.
4593	4595	(KATHRYN CRYING) l'm sick of you!
4602	4604	What have you done?
4604	4607	Did you kill somebody? Yes.
4607	4609	A million people. Five billion people.
4609	4610	What?
4611	4615	Jeffrey Goines said it was my idea about the virus.
4616	4620	We were in the institution. lt was all so fuzzy and the drugs and all.
4621	4623	Do you think it was my idea?
4624	4626	Do you think maybe l've wiped out the human race?
4626	4629	Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race.
4630	4632	Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.
4633	4636	You've created something in your mind. A... Oh.
4636	4639	Mentally divergent? A... Whatever!
4639	4641	A substitute reality,
4642	4645	because you don't want to deal with anything.
4646	4646	(LAUGHS)
4647	4648	l would love it if that was true.
4650	4654	lt can be dealt with, but only if you want to. l can help you.
4654	4656	(MEN YELLING)
4657	4659	They're after me. We have to get outta here.
4659	4660	Who is after you?
4661	4664	l think there were some policemen at that party.
4665	4668	Party? You went to a par...
4668	4670	Never mind.
4670	4673	lt's important you surrender instead of their catching you running.
4673	4674	Wouldn't it be great if l was crazy?
4675	4676	The world would be okay. l wouldn't have to live underground.
4676	4677	Gimme the gun. l lost the gun.
4677	4680	Where is the gun? l could live right here.
4680	4684	You got water, air, stars.
4684	4686	l'm gonna attract their attention... Debris.
4686	4688	...so they know where we are.
4688	4690	(HORN HONKING)
4690	4691	(LAUGHING)
4691	4692	Oh, l love this world!
4693	4695	They're gonna tell you to put your hands on your head. Do what they say.
4695	4697	l love the frogs, the spiders.
4697	4701	Remember, l'll be with you. l'll help you. l won't let them...
4709	4710	(DOGS BARKING)
4713	4717	Then l said something about cooperating, and he said he would do that. So, l...
4717	4719	l got in the car.
4720	4722	Thanks. And when l...
4723	4727	l started honking the horn. Then when l got out, he was gone.
4727	4729	l'll tell you somethin'. You lucked out.
4730	4733	For a while, we thought you were a body they found down state, mutilated.
4733	4736	He wouldn't do that. This the man he attacked?
4740	4742	l wanna be clear about this, okay?
4742	4745	This man and the other one were severely beating us.
4746	4749	James Cole didn't start it. ln fact, he saved me.
4750	4751	(CHUCKLES)
4751	4754	Funny thing, Doctor. Maybe you can help explain it to me,
4754	4757	you being a psychiatrist and all.
4757	4759	Why is it that kidnap victims
4759	4762	always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em?
4762	4765	And they try to make us understand
4765	4768	how kind these bastards really were?
4769	4772	lt's a normal reaction to a life-threatening situation.
4775	4777	He's sick. Okay?
4778	4780	He thinks he comes from the future.
4780	4783	He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world,
4783	4786	and that world is starting to disintegrate. He needs help.
4791	4792	Okay.
4794	4798	REPORTER: Exhausted but apparently unharmed by her thirty-hour ordeal,
4798	4802	Dr. Railly returned to Baltimore this morning without making a public statement.
4802	4806	The author and psychiatrist is currently in seclusion at her home.
4806	4810	Meantime, police have pieced together a scenario of the series of events
4810	4813	that began with escaped mental patient James Cole...
4813	4814	Sorry.
4814	4818	No, it's okay. l'm just hyperalert. l can't sleep.
4819	4820	Did you take your sedative?
4820	4823	l hate those things. They mess my head up.
4824	4826	...where he went on a rampage of violence.
4827	4829	With the kidnapping of the Baltimore woman,
4829	4831	James Cole is now also wanted in connection with
4831	4835	the brutal slaying of Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore.
4835	4838	(SIREN WAILING) His body was discovered in an abandoned theater
4838	4842	not far from where Cole leи three animal rights activists bound and gagged
4842	4844	in their Second Avenue headquarters.
4844	4848	Do they really believe he's going to show up here? Please.
4848	4851	And in Fresno, California, the cornfield that was jammed with spectators...
4852	4854	He's dead, isn't he, that little boy?
4854	4857	He's fine. lt was just a prank he and his friends pulled.
4857	4860	The dramatic attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman from an abandoned mineshaft
4861	4863	ended abruptly when playmates confessed
4863	4866	that Neuman's disappearance was merely a prank.
4866	4870	And that, in fact, the missing child was hiding in a nearby barn.
4878	4881	SCIENTISTS: l found my thrill
4882	4886	On Blueberry Hill
4886	4890	On Blueberry Hill
4890	4892	When l found you
4893	4894	Congratulations, Cole!
4894	4897	Well done. Well done! Congratulations.
4897	4900	BOTANIST: During your interview, while under the influence,
4900	4901	you told us that you liked music.
4901	4903	This isn't a prison. This is a hospital.
4903	4905	Until you recover your equilibrium.
4905	4906	You're still disoriented.
4906	4909	lt is a stressful thing. Time travel.
4909	4911	You stood up very well, considering.
4911	4912	You connected the Army of the Twelve Monkeys
4912	4914	with a famous virologist and his son.
4914	4915	Others will take over now.
4915	4917	We'll be back on service in months.
4917	4918	We'll retake the planet.
4918	4920	This is it, James. What you've been working for.
4920	4921	A full pardon.
4921	4923	You'll be out of here in no time.
4923	4925	Women will want to know you.
4925	4927	l don't want your women! l want to get well!
4933	4935	And you will be well, James.
4936	4937	Soon.
4937	4938	(LAUGHING)
4942	4944	You know, you people don't exist. You're not real.
4946	4948	We can't travel back in time.
4948	4949	Whoop! Whoop! Uh-uh.
4950	4951	You're not here.
4952	4953	You can't trick me.
4953	4954	(LAUGHING)
4955	4957	You're in my mind.
4957	4958	(LAUGHING)

4960	4963	l am insane. And you are my insanity.
4963	4964	(LAUGHING)
4974	4978	He not only used the word "prank," he said the boy was hiding in a barn.
4978	4982	Kathryn, Kathryn. He kidnapped you.
4983	4985	You saw him murder somebody,
4985	4989	and you knew there was a real possibility that he could kill you too.
4990	4992	You're under tremendous emotional stress.
4992	4994	For God's sake, Owen, listen to me.
4995	4997	He knew about the boy in Fresno, and he says
4997	4999	five billion people are gonna die.
4999	5002	No way he could possibly know that!
5002	5003	Kathryn!
5004	5007	You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.
5008	5011	You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
5011	5014	What we say is the truth, is what everybody accepts. Right?
5014	5016	Psychiatry, it's the latest religion.
5016	5020	We decide what's right and wrong. We decide who's crazy or not.
5023	5024	l'm in trouble here.
5024	5026	l'm losing my faith.
5028	5031	MAN WITH RASPY VOICE: You sure fucked up, Bob.
5031	5033	But l can understand.
5033	5036	You don't want your mistakes pointed out to you.
5036	5039	l can relate to that, old Bob.
5040	5042	Hey, l know what you're thinkin'.
5043	5047	You're thinkin' l don't exist except in your head.
5048	5050	l see that point of view.
5050	5053	But you could still talk to me, couldn't ya?
5053	5058	l saw you in 1006 in the real world.
5059	5060	You pulled out your teeth.
5060	5065	Why would l pull out my teeth? That's a no-no.
5065	5068	And when did you say you saw me?
5068	5070	ln 1и72?
5070	5071	Leave me alone!
5071	5074	Yellin' won't get you what you want.
5075	5079	You have to be smart to get what you want.
5081	5083	And what do l want?
5083	5085	You don't know what you want?
5085	5088	Sure you do, Bob.
5088	5091	You know what you want.
5091	5094	You tell me. You tell me what l want.
5094	5098	To see the sky and the ocean.
5099	5100	To be topside.
5101	5103	Breathe the air.
5104	5107	To be with her.
5107	5109	lsn't that right?
5110	5112	lsn't that what you want?
5113	5114	Bob?
5123	5124	(MOANING)
5125	5126	(RINGING)
5130	5131	Hello.
5132	5136	Dr. Railly, Jim Halperin, Philly P.D. Sorry to call you so early this mornin'.
5137	5138	You found him?
5139	5140	ls he okay?
5140	5142	No, no, au contraire, Doctor.
5143	5144	No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper.
5144	5147	However, the plot does thicken.
5147	5149	l've got a ballistics report on my desk.
5149	5152	lt says the bullet you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's thigh
5152	5154	is, in fact, an antique.
5154	5159	HALPERIN: And all indications are it was fired sometime prior to the 192иs.
5160	5161	How 'bout l take a spin down there?
5161	5162	This can't be.
5162	5164	Maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
5164	5167	Maybe you could revise or amplify your statement.
5168	5169	Dr. Railly?
5196	5197	No!
5202	5205	You can't trick us, you know. lt wouldn't work.
5207	5208	COLE: No, sir.
5209	5214	You haven't become addicted, have you, Cole, to that dying world?
5214	5215	No, sir.
5216	5218	l just want to do my part
5218	5221	to get us back on top, in charge of the planet.
5221	5225	And l have the experience. l know the people involved.
5226	5228	He really is the most qualified.
5228	5230	But all of that behavior.
5231	5233	You said we weren't real, Cole.
5234	5237	l don't think the human mind is meant to exist
5238	5240	in two different,
5240	5242	whatever you called it, dimensions?
5242	5245	lt's just too stressful. You said that yourself.
5245	5248	lt's very confusing, you don't know what's real and what's not.
5248	5251	MICROBIOLOGIST: But you know what's real now.
5252	5254	Yes, sir. l do.
5256	5258	DR. GOINES: No, no. l don't know anything about
5258	5261	a monkey army, Doctor.
5261	5263	No, no. Nothing whatsoever.
5264	5267	Good Lord, if my son was ever involved in something like that...
5268	5270	(MICE SQUEAKING)
5271	5276	Well, l'm sorry. l think it is doubly inappropriate to discuss
5276	5281	security matters with you, Dr. Railly.
5281	5284	But if it will ease your mind,
5285	5287	rest assured that neither my son
5287	5290	nor any other unauthorized person has access
5290	5294	to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory.
5294	5298	ls that clear to you now? Thank you so much for your concern.
5303	5306	(WHISPERING) Women psychiatrists!
5309	5311	l attended a lecture of hers once.
5312	5314	"Apocalyptic Visions."
5316	5317	Yes. She was
5318	5322	suddenly struck by the most preposterous notion
5322	5323	about Jeffrey.
5325	5327	Has she succumbed to her own
5328	5331	"theoretical" Cassandra disease?
5334	5338	Maybe we ought to review our security procedures.
5340	5341	Yeah. Perhaps upgrade 'em, you know?
5342	5344	Beef them up?
5349	5352	BOTANIST: Let's consider again our current information.
5352	5355	lf the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia
5355	5359	on December 27, 1006, that makes us know that...
5359	5363	lt was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1006.
5363	5366	And was seen sequentially after that in...
5366	5368	San Francisco, New Orleans,
5369	5370	Rio de Janeiro,
5371	5374	Rome, Kinshasa,
5374	5376	Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
5379	5382	That was very well done, Cole.

5392	5395	ls somebody in there? lf you're in there, l have to talk to you.
5396	5397	lt's the kidnap woman. Hello?
5397	5400	The one who was with the guy who tied us up.
5400	5402	Turn off the lights. Turn off the light!
5403	5405	What's she doin'? She's drawing attention to us, that's what.
5405	5408	l don't know what you're up to this time, Goines,
5408	5410	but you're going to get us in deep shit.

5441	5443	l have to contact James.
5443	5447	lt's very, very important that he's really careful when he reaches me.
5447	5448	Do you understand that?
5448	5450	Yeah. Yeah. Good.
5450	5451	Who's James?
5451	5452	He was with me.
5453	5456	He spoke to you several weeks ago.
5456	5459	He said that you were from the future and that you were watching him.
5466	5469	Bolt cutters. Bolt cutters. Did you get the bolt cutters?
5470	5472	One dozen. They're in the van.
5472	5473	Got the plans for the security system?
5473	5475	Right here. Committed to memory.
5475	5478	Hey! Hey! You know what she's doing out there?
5479	5481	What's it say? l don't know. l can't see it.
5481	5485	Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand.

5488	5491	Did you just say your psychiatrist?

5567	5571	No problem. lt's probably just another kidnapping
5571	5574	featuring Jeffrey's shrink. Pardon me. Make that ex-shrink.

5593	5594	lmpossible!
5594	5596	Do you know why? Do you know why?
5596	5599	Because, you pathetically ineffectual
5599	5602	and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals, l'll tell you why.
5602	5605	When l had anything to do with her six years ago,
5605	5607	there was no such thing, l hadn't thought of it yet.
5607	5609	Then how come she knows what's goin' on?
5610	5612	Here's my theory on that.
5612	5614	When l was institutionalized,
5614	5617	my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
5617	5620	l was interrogated, x-rayed. l was examined thoroughly.
5621	5622	(COUGHS)
5622	5625	They took everything about me and put it into a computer
5625	5628	where they created this model of my mind. Yes!
5628	5631	Using that model, they managed to generate
5631	5635	every thought l could possibly have in the next ten years,
5635	5639	which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind
5639	5643	to determine everything l was gonna do in that period.
5643	5646	So you see, she knew l was gonna lead
5646	5648	the Army of the Twelve Monkeys into history
5648	5650	before it even occurred to me.
5650	5653	She knows everything l'm ever gonna do before l know it myself.
5654	5655	How's that?
5658	5660	Kweskin, you finish here. l'll meet you there.
5660	5664	And if you forget one thing, l will have you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.
