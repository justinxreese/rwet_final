91	94	In the final decade of the 21st century...
94	97	men and women in rocket ships landed on the moon.
98	102	By 2200 A.D., they had reached the other planets of our solar system.
102	105	Almost at once there followed the discovery of hyper-drive...
106	108	through which the speed of light was first attained...
108	110	and later greatly surpassed.
110	114	And so at last, mankind began the conquest...
114	116	and colonization of deep space.
116	120	United Planets cruiser C-57-D...
120	123	now more than a year out from Earth base on a special mission...
123	127	to the planetary system of the great main sequence star, Altair.
135	139	- When do we get a D.C. fix, Jerry? - Half a minute, Skipper.
142	145	Ship on course, sir. We'll reach D.C. point at 1701.
145	148	That's less than three minutes now.
149	152	- All right, take it away. - Aye, aye, sir.
153	156	Chief, we'll drop back below light speed in about three minutes.
156	158	- Got your breakable gear stowed? - Aye, aye, sir.
158	160	All right. Good.
163	165	D.C. set and punched on, Skipper.
165	170	All right, attention. Captain to crew. All hands squared away to decelerate.
170	173	Ship's beeper will, as usual, sound ten times after lights dim.
173	175	- Come on, Doc. D.C., Bosun. - Aye, aye, sir.
175	179	D.C. stations, on the double.
180	182	Wanna bounce through this one?
256	260	All right, we're down to.3896 of light speed.
264	266	It's a little warm in here, Skipper.
284	287	There's Altair right on the nose, Skipper.
301	304	Meanwhile, this ship arranges its own eclipses.
310	314	Okay, Jerry, punch out an orbit on the fourth planet.
314	316	Aye, aye, Skipper.
318	322	Ship in approach, Skipper. Helical vector oriented.
322	325	Attention. Captain to crew. Attention.
325	329	Our destination, Altair-4, is now visible on the main view-plate.
331	335	As you'll recollect from your briefing lectures, this is an Earth-type planet.
335	338	Twenty years ago, the spacecraft Belerephon landed here...
338	340	with a prospecting party of scientists.
340	344	Our mission is to search for survivors. That is all.
361	364	The Lord sure makes some beautiful worlds.
364	367	How do these continents check with the old charts?
367	371	Be able to tell you better in a while, Skipper. It's time for brakes.
371	373	Okay, take it away.
373	376	Astrogator to crew. Stand by to change flux.
403	406	Another one of them new worlds.
406	409	No beer, no women, no pool parlors, nothing.
409	413	Nothing to do but throw rocks at tin cans, and we gotta bring our own cans.
413	415	Attention. Captain to crew.
415	419	We are now entering the atmosphere of Altair-4.
419	421	No survival suits will be required upon landing.
421	426	Oxygen content: 4.7 richer than Earth standard.
426	428	Gravity, only.897.
429	431	Adjust your equipment accordingly. That is all.
431	434	All hands, check equipment.
445	448	Not even any short-range radio signals yet?
448	450	Not so far, sir.
455	457	Can you make out anything down there?
457	460	I may be missing some individual structures...
460	463	but there are no cities, ports, roads, bridges, dams.
464	465	There's just no sign of civilization.
469	471	Sir, we're being radar-scanned.
472	474	- Can you zero on it? - No, sir.
474	477	It seems to emanate from an area of about 20 miles square.
477	479	Twenty miles square?
481	483	Bosun, pass the alert.
483	486	Combat stations. Blaster men, activate your scopes.
486	488	Radio contact, sir. There's a voice.
489	491	- Human? - It sounds like it.
491	493	Boost it.
494	498	Spaceship, identify yourself. You're being tracked.
498	500	Cut me in, Quinn.
500	505	United Planets Cruiser C-57-D, J.J. Adams commanding.
505	508	- Who are you? - Morbius of theBelerephon.
509	512	- Who? - Edward Morbius.
514	518	Here it is. "Morbius, E. Ph.D., Lit.D. Expedition philologist."
519	522	- Philologist? - What do you wish here, cruiser?
522	527	You don't understand. We're your relief. We're glad to find you alive.
527	529	I, of course, appreciate your concern...
529	533	but absolutely no assistance of any sort is required.
533	536	The red carpet treatment, huh?
536	540	Dr. Morbius, my orders are to survey the situation on Altair-4.
540	544	Let me repeat: I'm in no sort of difficulty here.
544	548	Your best procedure will be to turn back at once without landing.
548	549	Sorry, sir.
550	552	If you set down on this planet, I warn you...
552	557	that I cannot be answerable for the safety of your ship or your crew.
557	561	If you'll just supply me with landing coordinates.
562	566	Dr. Morbius, I require landing coordinates.
566	570	Very well, but I wash my hands of all responsibility.
570	574	- You have standard charts? - Yes, sir.
574	579	You may come in at 83-17-4 north...
579	583	148-21 west.
583	585	Thank you.
587	589	It's right back there in the desert.
589	593	Commander, I urge you to reconsider. Please permit me to recommend...
594	597	Something funny down there, Skipper.
600	603	Okay, Jerry, I'll take her in.
603	604	Right.
607	610	Attention. Captain to crew. Stand by to reverse polarity.
610	614	Standard class "A" security will be maintained upon landing...
614	617	and until further notice, all hands will wear side arms.
617	620	That is all.
620	622	- Artificial gravity off. - Grav. off.
622	623	- Half flux. - Half flux.
623	626	- Cut primary coils. - Primaries cut, sir.
692	694	All clear, sir.
702	704	Look at the color of that sky.
704	706	Yeah, but I'll still take blue.
706	709	I don't know. I think a man could get used to this...
709	711	and grow to love it.
711	714	Bosun, you can assemble the tractor.
714	716	Better check the command mike.
716	719	- The command mike, sir. - Oh, good idea.
719	720	- Chief? - Sir?
721	723	You're in command now, Quinn. You keep right at those instruments.
723	726	- Aye, aye, sir. - Hey, what's this dust coming?
741	743	Looks like we're being met.
743	745	Bosun.
745	747	Hold the tractor.
749	753	- Quite a vehicle, huh? - That driver must be a madman.
754	756	What driver?
787	790	Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.
790	794	I am to transport you to the residence.
796	799	If you do not speak English...
799	802	I am at your disposal with 187 other languages...
802	805	along with their various dialects and sub-tongues.
805	809	Colloquial English will do fine, thank you.
809	813	This is no offense, but you are a robot, aren't you?
815	817	That is correct, sir.
817	822	For your convenience, I am monitored to respond to the name "Robby."
822	826	Nice climate you have here.
826	828	High oxygen content.
828	832	I rarely use it myself, sir. It promotes rust.
833	836	Hey, Doc, is it a male or a female?
839	843	In my case, sir, the question is totally without meaning.
843	845	Will you get in, gentlemen?
854	858	Quinn, tractors if I blink red.
858	861	- I'll bring a tractor in a hurry, sir. - Right.
880	884	Passengers will please fasten their seat belts.
888	890	Looks after us like a mother.
910	914	If you gentlemen will go in, you're expected.
927	930	- I am Morbius. - I am Commander Adams.
930	932	This is Lieutenant Farman, my executive...
932	935	and Lieutenant Ostrow, our ship's doctor.
938	942	How ironic that a simple scholar with no ambition...
942	945	beyond a modest measure of seclusion, should, out of a clear sky...
945	949	find himself besieged by an army of fellow creatures...
949	952	all grimly determined to be of service to him.
952	957	I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome, but we do have our orders.
957	959	But you must stay for lunch, gentlemen...
959	962	and do forgive the ill manners of an old recluse.
962	964	Won't you come in?
974	978	Whatever that lunch was, it was certainly delicious.
978	980	Simply some of Robby's synthetics.
980	985	- He's your cook too? - Even manufactures the raw materials.
985	987	Come around here, Robby.
987	990	I'll show you how this works.
994	998	One introduces a sample of human food through this aperture.
998	1001	Here there's a small built-in chemical laboratory where he analyzes it.
1001	1005	Later he can reproduce identical molecules in any shape or quantity.
1005	1008	Why, it's a housewife's dream.
1008	1011	Plus absolute selfless obedience.
1011	1014	Activate the dispose-all unit.
1024	1027	A household disintegrator beam.
1028	1030	Put your arm in there.
1032	1035	Order cancelled.
1035	1037	Don't attribute feeling to him, gentlemen.
1037	1040	Robby is simply a tool. Tremendously strong, of course.
1040	1044	He could quite easily topple this house off its foundation.
1044	1047	In the wrong hands, mightn't such a tool become a deadly weapon?
1048	1052	No, Doctor, not even though I were the mad scientist of the tape thrillers...
1052	1055	because, you see, there happens to be a built-in safety factor.
1055	1059	Commander, may I borrow that formidable-Iooking side arm of yours?
1065	1066	Thank you.
1066	1071	Robby, point this thing at that althaea frutex out there on the terrace.
1073	1076	Fire.
1080	1082	You understand the mechanism?
1082	1087	Yes, Morbius. A simple blaster.
1087	1090	All right. Now turn around here.
1092	1094	Point it at the commander.
1100	1101	Aim right between the eyes.
1106	1107	Fire.
1115	1117	You see, he's helpless...
1117	1121	Iocked in a sub-electronic dilemma between my direct orders...
1121	1124	and his basic inhibitions against harming rational beings.
1124	1126	Cancelled.
1127	1129	If I were to allow that to continue...
1129	1132	he would blow every circuit in his body.
1134	1137	Doctor, how did you come by such a mechanism?
1137	1141	Uh, I didn't "come by" him, Doctor...
1141	1146	I tinkered him together during my first months up here.
1146	1149	- Coffee is ready, sir. - Gentlemen.
1149	1154	Doctor, do you mean that you made this gentleman?
1154	1157	A useful enough toy, Lieutenant...
1157	1161	but nowadays I have no time for such things.
1162	1167	Dr. Morbius, you're a philologist, an expert in words and languages...
1167	1169	their origins and meanings.
1169	1172	Yet this robot of yours is beyond the combined resources...
1172	1175	of all Earth's physical science.
1175	1178	My dear Commander, maybe you overestimate...
1178	1180	both Robby and myself.
1181	1184	Gentlemen, let me show you another bit of parlor magic.
1193	1196	Forgive me. I didn't mean to alarm you, gentlemen.
1196	1198	I had Robby install the steel shutters...
1198	1201	before I realized how altogether safe I am here.
1208	1211	Well, gentlemen, this has been very pleasant.
1211	1213	You've seen how comfortable I am here...
1213	1217	no hardships, no special difficulties...
1217	1220	and no need at all for military assistance.
1220	1223	Now I daresay you're impatient to get back to base.
1223	1226	Yes, the moment we've interviewed the other members of the Belerephon party.
1228	1231	Others. But there are no others, Commander.
1231	1235	Before the first year was out, they had all, every man and woman...
1235	1239	succumbed to a... to a sort of a planetary force here...
1239	1243	some dark, terrible, incomprehensible force.
1243	1245	Only my wife and I were immune.
1246	1249	And just how do you account for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?
1249	1253	We differed from the others only in our special love for this world...
1253	1257	in our boundless longing to make a home here...
1257	1260	far from the scurry and strife of humankind.
1261	1265	I remember how, when the vote was taken to return to Earth...
1265	1269	she and I were utterly heartbroken.
1269	1273	How could we have foreseen the extinction of coworkers and friends?
1274	1278	Skipper, there is no record of any wife in the Belerephon rolls.
1278	1281	Lieutenant, look under "biochemistry," Julia Marsin.
1282	1284	She and I were married by the skipper on the voyage here.
1284	1286	I have the certificate.
1286	1291	I thought Robby had managed some very charming feminine touches.
1291	1293	I take it Mrs. Morbius isn't at home today?
1294	1297	My dear wife died a few months after the others.
1297	1300	Only in her case, it was of natural causes.
1300	1302	I'm very sorry.
1303	1305	Dr. Morbius, just what were the symptoms...
1305	1308	of all those other deaths, the unnatural ones?
1308	1311	The symptoms were striking, Commander.
1311	1313	One by one, in spite of every safeguard...
1313	1316	my coworkers were torn literally limb from limb.
1316	1317	By what?
1317	1320	By some devilish thing that never once showed itself.
1320	1322	- And the Belerephon? - Vaporized...
1322	1325	as the three remaining survivors tried to take her off.
1327	1330	And yet, in all these 19 years...
1330	1335	you personally have never again been bothered by this planetary force?
1336	1340	Only in nightmares of those times.
1340	1342	And yet, always in my mind...
1342	1346	I seem to feel the creature is lurking somewhere close at hand...
1346	1350	sly and irresistible, and only waiting to be re-invoked for murder.
1352	1355	Father?
1357	1359	Alta!
1359	1362	Alta, I specifically asked you...
1362	1364	not to join us for lunch.
1364	1366	But, Father, lunch is over.
1366	1369	I'm sure you never said a word about not coming in for coffee.
1369	1372	Well, did you or did you?
1372	1374	This is Commander Adams...
1374	1378	Dr. Ostrow and, uh, Lieutenant Farman.
1378	1379	- My daughter. - How do you do?
1380	1384	I've always so terribly wanted to meet a young man, and now three at once.
1384	1387	- That's very kind of you. - You're lovely, Doctor.
1389	1392	Of course, the two end ones are unbelievable.
1393	1396	Could this end one get you some coffee?
1396	1399	I'm quite able to get it, thank you.
1407	1408	Thank you.
1409	1412	Of course, you must make allowances for my daughter, gentlemen.
1412	1416	She's never known any human being except her father.
1416	1419	I hope you'll make allowances too, sir.
1419	1423	We young men have been shut up in hyperspace for well over a year now...
1423	1426	and right from here, the view looks just like heaven.
1426	1427	Sugar?
1427	1431	But you keep helping me. After all, you're not Robby.
1431	1434	I wouldn't mind being Robby in certain ways.
1434	1437	That's only in certain ways, of course.
1437	1441	I can see that was probably very clever, but I don't seem to understand it.
1442	1445	Well, there's... There's no rush.
1448	1452	I suppose one day I shall be obliged to make the trip to Earth with her...
1452	1456	for the sake of her natural development.
1456	1458	I should say fairly soon too.
1459	1463	Your father wasn't too happy at first about your meeting us, was he?
1463	1466	Well, naturally not. You're from Earth.
1466	1469	- What's wrong with Earth? - How lucky I am, though.
1469	1473	All three of you are such very fine exceptions.
1473	1477	- You are exceptions, aren't you? - Oh, sure, sure.
1477	1479	That is, I am, anyway.
1479	1482	Old dependable Jerry.
1482	1486	Of course, the doc can be trusted too, in the daytime.
1488	1491	What about the commander?
1491	1494	Well, I hate to tell you this, Alta, but...
1494	1499	that man is notorious throughout seven planetary systems.
1499	1502	Oh, dear. What does he do?
1502	1505	Well, I don't feel free to discuss...
1505	1509	the shortcomings of a fellow officer, but...
1509	1513	any girl or woman who lets him get her alone, anywhere...
1522	1524	Yes, I can see it now.
1524	1528	There, just then when he looked at me, his eyes almost had fire in them.
1529	1533	I'm so glad you don't have any fire in your eyes, Lieutenant.
1533	1535	Well, I'm not that harmless.
1535	1539	- Alta? - Yes, Father?
1541	1544	These gentlemen have expressed a very kindly concern...
1544	1547	- over the amount of liberty you have. - Liberty?
1547	1551	I told them that you have my permission to visit Earth whenever you choose.
1551	1553	Earth? I?
1553	1556	Then my little girl never feels Ionely or confined?
1557	1561	Why, I don't know. I have you and Robby and all my friends.
1561	1562	Friends?
1566	1569	- Perhaps you'd better call them, dear. - All right.
1569	1571	Come, gentlemen.
1577	1581	I felt something go right through my head.
1581	1585	Alta's whistle is above the pitch of human hearing. I often feel it myself.
1608	1610	- What's up? - Look.
1615	1617	No. Watch.
1625	1627	Why, he's as tame as a kitten.
1627	1631	Outside of the range of my daughter's influence, it's still a deadly beast.
1642	1645	Just a routine checkup from the ship.
1645	1647	- What, Chief? - Everything okay, Commander?
1647	1650	- No problem. - Would you mind activating the viewer?
1654	1658	As you can see, we're under no restraint whatsoever.
1660	1662	Knock that off, Quinn.
1662	1666	If I can be of any help to you in your preparations for the homeward voyage...
1666	1671	Thank you, sir, but unfortunately circumstances may keep us here a while.
1671	1673	- Circumstances? - You see, my orders...
1673	1675	don't quite seem to cover the Belerephon fatalities.
1676	1680	I am forced now to contact base for new instructions.
1680	1683	But, Commander, suppose these new instructions...
1683	1686	require my return to Earth for questioning...
1686	1689	two years or more away from my work here?
1689	1694	Tell me, just what is involved in your making contact with Earth base?
1694	1696	Fundamentally, it's a question of crude power...
1696	1700	how to short-circuit the continuum on a five or six parsec level.
1700	1702	Of course, a transmitter like that isn't standard equipment.
1702	1704	- No. - To build one...
1704	1708	we'd cannibalize about two-thirds of the ship's electronic gear...
1708	1710	and then unship the main drive to juice it.
1710	1715	Just to construct a bunker to house the core would take about ten days.
1715	1718	Disabled here for ten days and nights?
1718	1721	Tell me, would two-inch lead shielding do as well?
1721	1724	It'd be better if we happened to be carrying 100 square yards of the stuff.
1724	1727	Then I'll have Robby run it off for you...
1727	1729	and you'll get it not later than tomorrow noon.
1729	1732	That's very obliging of you, sir.
1732	1734	Obliging?
1734	1737	Look out there, Commander, the Belerephon party.
1737	1740	Nineteen years ago I dug those graves with my own hands...
1741	1744	and I have, believe me, no wish to repeat that experience.
1759	1762	We'll see you again soon, Alta, I hope.
1762	1766	- Thank you very much, Doctor. - Excellent lunch, Doctor.
1766	1769	To tell the truth, I sometimes still miss the conversation...
1769	1773	of such gentlemen as yourself, Doctor.
1773	1776	Well, thank you for your courtesy and concern, sir.
1787	1790	Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
1816	1819	Easy with this core. Our M.G. coils won't take us home without it.
1819	1822	Come on, Cookie, out of the way. You wanna get run over?
1822	1825	Handle it gently. It has to get us home.
1829	1832	- Is it far enough away from the ship? - Sure. No interference there.
1832	1836	- What about the magnetic pull? - Bosun, drop the thing down over there.
1836	1838	Aye, aye, sir.
1845	1848	Where do you wish the shielding stacked, sir?
1848	1852	You can just put it right over there by the core, thank you.
1852	1855	Wait a minute. That's solid lead he's carrying.
1855	1858	Common lead would have crushed the vehicle, sir.
1858	1862	This is my morning's run of isotope 217.
1862	1865	The whole thing hardly comes to ten tons.
1866	1868	Hello, Alta.
1868	1871	Does your father know you're here?
1871	1874	He did tell me not to go near the ship, but this isn't very near.
1876	1878	- Cookie, out of here. - Aye, aye, sir.
1878	1880	Yes, sir.
1892	1896	Commander, put me down, sir!
1897	1899	- Commander. - What is it, Chief?
1899	1901	If you'd like to check my assembly...
1901	1904	for the monitor unit of the Klystron transmitter...
1904	1907	- What, already? - Yes, sir.
1907	1908	Excellent.
1913	1916	Are... are these condensers out of my accelerator circuits?
1916	1920	Yes, sir. I borrowed some solenoids from your gyrostabilizers too.
1920	1922	Here's the big deal, sir.
1922	1925	I'll bet any quantum mechanic would give his life...
1925	1927	for a chance to fool around with this gadget.
1927	1929	Get this in the ship by dark.
1929	1933	It won't do any good to have some fool fall on it before we transmit tomorrow.
1933	1935	- Good work, Quinn. - Thank you, sir.
1941	1943	Come here. Over here.
1951	1953	Can I be of service, sir?
1953	1956	Never mind the "sir," but I'm a stranger in this so-called planet...
1956	1959	and I was just wondering if you could tell me...
1959	1962	where I could get hold of some of the real stuff.
1962	1966	- "Real stuff"? - Just for cooking purposes.
1966	1969	I take a big pride in my duties.
1969	1972	Pardon me, sir. "Stuff"?
1980	1984	Just about one jolt left. Oh, genuine Ancient Rocket bourbon.
1984	1987	See here? Hey!
1989	1993	You low-living contraption! I oughta take a can opener to you!
1993	1996	Quiet, please. I am analyzing.
2000	2005	Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules with traces of fusel oil.
2007	2011	Would 60 gallons be sufficient?
2011	2013	Gallons?
2013	2016	I've been from here to there in this galaxy, and I want you to know...
2016	2020	you're the most understanding soul I ever met up with.
2025	2028	It's nothing really personal, just a kiss.
2028	2032	Hmm. But why should people want to kiss each other?
2032	2034	It's an old custom.
2034	2036	All the really high civilizations go in for it.
2036	2039	- But it's so silly. - But it's good for you, though.
2039	2042	It stimulates the whole system.
2042	2045	As a matter of fact, you can't be in tip-top health without it.
2045	2048	Really? I didn't know that.
2048	2050	I'd be only too happy to show you.
2050	2053	Well, thank you very much, Lieutenant.
2053	2055	No trouble at all.
2064	2065	Is that all there is to it?
2067	2070	Well, you've sort of got to stick with it.
2080	2082	Just once more, do you mind?
2082	2084	Not at all.
2091	2093	There must be something seriously the matter with me...
2093	2096	because I haven't noticed the least bit of stimulation.
2097	2101	Honey, let's do this thing right. Now, here.
2115	2118	Are you giving me the treatment? Are you?
2120	2121	Lieutenant Farman.
2122	2124	Don't say a word, sir.
2124	2127	I know there are lots of pressing duties waiting for me back at the ship...
2127	2131	and rank doth have its little privileges, hmm, sir?
2131	2134	And you can depend on it that those privileges won't be stretched...
2134	2136	into taking your kind of advantages.
2137	2139	- But l... - Dismissed.
2145	2149	What's the matter with him? Why did you both act so funny?
2149	2152	Well, what'd you expect?
2152	2155	Don't you understand, Alta?
2155	2158	No? Well, look at yourself.
2158	2163	You can't dress like that around men, especially not a space wolf like Farman.
2163	2167	So for Pete's sake, go home and put on something that'Il...
2168	2168	Anything.
2172	2175	What's wrong with my clothes? I designed them myself.
2179	2181	Stop looking at me that way. I don't think I like it.
2183	2185	What do you mean?
2185	2188	We were just trying to get some healthy stimulation...
2188	2191	from hugging and kissing, that's all.
2191	2194	Oh, that's all? It's so easy for you, isn't it?
2194	2198	There's no feelings, no emotions. You, uh...
2199	2201	Nothing human would ever enter your mind.
2201	2205	It so happens that I'm in command of 18 competitively selected...
2205	2207	super-perfect physical specimens...
2207	2210	with an average age of 24.6...
2210	2215	who have been locked up in hyperspace for 378 days!
2215	2219	It would have served you right if I hadn't have... and he...
2220	2223	Get out of here before I have you run out of the area under guard...
2224	2227	and then I'll put more guards on the guards!
2237	2240	"And then I'll put more guards on the guards!"
2241	2244	I don't like him. I just don't like him.
2245	2248	The way he kept looking at me. Then he shouted.
2248	2251	- What about? - I don't know, really.
2251	2253	It was awful.
2253	2257	I was only trying to be nice about kissing the lieutenant.
2259	2262	- How did the commander react to that? - He was furious.
2262	2265	He seemed to think that all that about biology had something to do with me.
2265	2269	Personally, I mean. I've never been so nervous in my life.
2269	2273	I hope I don't see him again if I live to be 400 million!
2273	2276	Well, I daresay you won't have to.
2276	2278	The best thing you can do is to go to bed.
2278	2281	I still have some work to do in my study.
2281	2283	- Good night, my dear. - Good night.
2306	2310	Where have you been? I've beamed and beamed.
2310	2312	Sorry, miss.
2312	2314	I was giving myself an oil job.
2314	2317	And what is it you require this time, Miss Alta?
2318	2322	Robby, I must have a new dress, right away.
2322	2324	- Again? - But this one must be different.
2324	2328	Absolutely nothing must show... below, above or through.
2329	2331	Radiation-proof?
2331	2334	No, just eye-proof will do.
2334	2336	- Thick and heavy? - Oh, no, Robby.
2336	2340	It must be the loveliest, softest thing you've ever made for me...
2340	2343	and fit in all the right places, with lots and lots of star sapphires.
2345	2348	Star sapphires take a week to crystallize properly.
2348	2351	Would diamonds or emeralds do?
2351	2353	Well, if they're large enough.
2353	2357	Five, ten and fifteen carats, and on hand.
2358	2361	I will run the dress up for you in time for breakfast.
2364	2367	- Sleep well, miss. - Thank you, Robby.
2368	2370	I don't really care now whether I do or not.
2382	2385	Funny to see two moons in the sky, isn't it?
2386	2388	Funny how quick a guy gets used to it.
2394	2397	- Joe. - What?
2397	2400	- Do you hear something? - Like what?
2400	2403	Like a sort of big breathing.
2406	2410	That's funny. I did.
2453	2457	Strong and Grey, last night during your watch this ship was entered...
2457	2460	and valuable government property was sabotaged.
2460	2464	The two of you claim to have been at your posts and awake.
2464	2467	Yet this ship was entered, the heavy-duty hatch was raised...
2467	2471	and latched back, and neither of you saw or heard anything.
2471	2474	Except you, Grey. You heard breathing.
2475	2478	And, Youngerford, let me see, you were asleep in your bunk...
2479	2483	and you think you had a dream.
2484	2486	A dream!
2488	2491	Pending more evidence, you're deprived of space pay and all privileges.
2491	2495	- Me too, sir? - No, you'll stand 20 extra watches.
2495	2497	I'll have less dreaming aboard this ship!
2499	2501	Dismissed!
2505	2509	Half of this gear we can replace and the rest we can patch up somehow...
2509	2512	except this special Klystron frequency modulator.
2512	2516	With every facility of the ship, I think I might be able to rebuild it...
2516	2519	but frankly, the book says no.
2519	2521	It came packed in liquid boron in a suspended grav...
2521	2524	All right, so it's impossible. How long will it take?
2524	2527	Well, if I don't stop for breakfast...
2531	2533	- Get on it, Quinn. - Thank you, sir.
2540	2541	The tractor's ready, sir.
2541	2545	- Wait. I'll put on a clean uniform. - You'd better stay as you are.
2545	2547	- I'm leaving you in command here. - Oh, I see.
2548	2551	Establish a standard perimeter and set up a class "A" alert by sundown.
2551	2553	Aye, aye, sir.
2603	2606	Good morning, gentlemen.
2606	2609	We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.
2609	2611	Morbius is in his study, sir...
2611	2614	never to be disturbed while that door is closed.
2616	2618	All right, we'll wait.
2623	2626	Is there any other way out of there?
2626	2628	This is the only door.
2628	2632	In case you require anything, gentlemen, use the beamer.
2639	2642	How could he have slipped past two sentries?
2647	2649	Nothing important, Skipper.
2649	2653	Doc, you stay right there where you are and keep your eye on that door.
2653	2657	Okay, Skipper. If Morbius comes out, we'll call you from right here.
2672	2673	Good morning.
2673	2675	Good morning.
2683	2686	- Come on in. - Didn't bring my bathing suit.
2686	2689	What's a bathing suit?
2689	2691	Oh, murder.
2691	2694	Never mind. I'm coming out.
2696	2698	Alta, listen. You mustn't...
2698	2702	You just wait right there. It'll only take me a second to get dry.
2705	2709	- I'll just turn my back here. - lf that's the way you feel about it.
2712	2715	Don't worry. You're not gonna have to look at me anymore.
2716	2718	You'll see.
2719	2723	- See what? - You'll see what.
2724	2728	Now wait a minute, Alta. If you're planning on...
2729	2733	I sure didn't expect to see you today after the way you spoke to me yesterday.
2736	2739	I'm very sorry about the way I spoke to you yesterday.
2739	2741	I was sort of bothered.
2748	2751	All right, you can look now.
2759	2761	Nothing shows through, does it?
2764	2767	I had it made especially for you.
2767	2771	Oh, I thought you weren't expecting me today.
2771	2773	I wasn't.
2775	2779	I guess there's just something about me personally you don't like.
2782	2785	You always look just beautiful.
2786	2788	Then why don't you kiss me like everybody else does?
2789	2790	Everybody?
2791	2793	Hasn't your father taught you anything?
2793	2796	Well, he says I'm terribly ignorant...
2796	2799	but I have had poetry and mathematics...
2799	2802	Iogic, physics, geology and bi...
2802	2803	Ology?
2803	2807	Of course, that's mostly on the theoretical side.
2807	2809	Well, so far.
2811	2813	What's wrong with theory?
2823	2824	This.
2852	2855	It's all right. He's my friend.
2872	2876	I'm sorry, Alta. I had to do that.
2876	2878	He didn't recognize me.
2878	2881	He would've killed me. Why?
2883	2887	- You really don't know, do you? - No, I don't.
2902	2905	- Is he still in there? - Hasn't come out.
2907	2911	Wait a minute, Skipper. After all, it is his house.
2912	2914	What's the matter?
2916	2918	Doc, something new has been added.
2923	2926	That's gonna complicate things a bit.
2943	2945	Not even a window.
2945	2949	The robot lied. Morbius hasn't been in here.
2949	2951	Doc, he's up to something.
2951	2953	Look at this, Skipper.
2955	2958	- Hieroglyphics? - Maybe.
2958	2962	But it doesn't look like Egyptian or cuneiform...
2962	2963	or Chinese.
2967	2969	You'll find the household silver in the dining room...
2969	2972	and my daughter's jewelry on her dressing table.
2973	2975	Dr. Morbius...
2976	2980	last night our Klystron monitor was sabotaged.
2981	2984	And you suspect me?
2984	2987	Then the time has come for clarification.
2987	2989	Sit down.
2999	3001	In times long past...
3001	3005	this planet was the home of a mighty and noble race of beings...
3005	3008	which called themselves the Krell.
3008	3011	Ethically, as well as technologically...
3011	3014	they were a million years ahead of humankind...
3014	3017	for in unlocking the mysteries of nature...
3017	3020	they had conquered even their baser selves...
3020	3023	and when, in the course of eons, they had abolished sickness...
3023	3026	and insanity and crime and all injustice...
3026	3028	they turned, still with high benevolence...
3028	3031	outward toward space.
3031	3035	Long before the dawn of man's history, they had walked our Earth...
3035	3037	and brought back many biological specimens.
3037	3041	I see. That explains the tiger and the deer.
3043	3045	The heights they had reached...
3045	3049	but then, seemingly on the threshold of some supreme accomplishment...
3050	3053	which was to have crowned their entire history...
3053	3057	this all but divine race perished in a single night.
3059	3062	In the 2,000 centuries since that unexplained catastrophe...
3062	3065	even their cloud-piercing towers...
3065	3067	of glass and porcelain and adamantine steel...
3067	3070	have crumbled back into the soil of Altair-4...
3070	3075	and nothing, absolutely nothing remains above ground.
3075	3077	What were they like?
3077	3081	No record of their physical nature has survived...
3081	3085	except, perhaps, in the form of this characteristic arch.
3085	3088	I suggest you consider it in comparison to one of our...
3088	3091	functionally designed human doorways.
3107	3111	That recording was made by Krell musicians a half a million years ago.
3113	3118	If you will follow me, I will show you some of their other remaining artifacts.
3134	3137	Krell metal. Try your blaster there, Commander.
3153	3154	This spot should be molten.
3154	3159	It's not even warm, and no trace of radioactivity.
3159	3162	The molecules are many times more densely interlocked...
3162	3164	than in earthly steel...
3164	3166	yet it drinks up energy like a sponge.
3185	3188	This is just one of their laboratories.
3188	3191	You will notice that much of the equipment is familiar...
3191	3193	though designed for nonhuman technicians.
3201	3203	What's this?
3205	3207	On this screen may be projected...
3207	3210	the total scientific knowledge of the Krell...
3210	3213	from its primitive beginning to the day of its annihilation...
3213	3217	a sheer bulk surpassing many million earthly libraries.
3217	3220	- You're able to read this? - A little. It's my profession.
3221	3224	Twenty years ago, I began here with...
3224	3226	this page of geometrical theorems.
3226	3230	Eventually I was able to deduce most of their huge, logical alphabet.
3230	3231	I began to learn.
3231	3234	The first practical result was my robot...
3234	3237	which you gentlemen appear to find so remarkable.
3237	3239	Child's play.
3239	3241	I've come here every day now for two decades...
3241	3246	painfully picking up a few of the least difficult fragments of their knowledge.
3246	3249	A thing like this, it's too big to evaluate.
3249	3251	Think what a discovery of this kind...
3251	3254	what is this device over here?
3254	3257	I call it their "plastic educator."
3257	3261	As far as I can make out, they used it to condition and test their young...
3262	3265	in much the same way as we once employed finger-painting...
3265	3266	among our kindergarten children.
3266	3269	I often play with it myself for relaxation...
3269	3272	although working here, I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...
3272	3274	with multiple arms and legs.
3275	3277	Now, you can see that this headset...
3277	3281	was designed for something much bulkier than my human cranium.
3286	3289	Now, over here you see...
3289	3291	the electromagnetic waves of my brain...
3291	3294	sending that indicator up about halfway.
3295	3299	I gather that one of their own young...
3299	3301	comparable to a seven-year-old child...
3301	3304	was normally expected to send that all the way to the top...
3304	3307	which by Krell standards classifies me as a low-grade moron.
3308	3311	Yet I have an officially recorded IQ of 183.
3312	3314	Now then, for the primary function.
3317	3319	Actually, to operate...
3319	3324	Well, I'll choose a familiar subject to start with to save time.
3331	3333	There now, gentlemen.
3338	3340	What's that?
3340	3341	What's happening there?
3347	3348	A statue.
3354	3355	That's Altaira.
3355	3358	Simply a three-dimensional image, Commander.
3358	3359	But it's alive!
3359	3364	Because my daughter is alive in my brain from microsecond to microsecond...
3364	3366	while I manipulate.
3367	3369	There.
3370	3372	Something of a strain.
3373	3376	Aladdin's lamp in a physics laboratory.
3376	3379	Would you gentlemen care to take the Krell test of your intelligence?
3379	3382	- Yes, very much. - You may be disappointed, Commander.
3382	3385	Suppose we start with the good doctor.
3385	3387	- What do I do? - Just sit down there, and I'Il...
3389	3391	Move forward.
3391	3392	There now.
3392	3396	Now, Doctor, you can read it here.
3396	3397	There's something wrong here.
3398	3401	I have an IQ of 161...
3401	3404	yet I don't register a third what you did.
3404	3406	Now the commander.
3420	3424	It's all right, sir. A commanding officer doesn't need brains.
3424	3426	Just a good loud voice, huh?
3426	3428	Do I pull this switch to make an image?
3428	3429	Stop! You'd never survive.
3430	3435	Our Belerephon skipper tried it, and it was instantly fatal to him.
3435	3439	Oh, I see. So you're immune to this too?
3439	3442	In my first attempt at creating an image here...
3442	3445	my brain pattern there was scarcely any larger than yours.
3445	3448	Afterwards, I lay unconscious for a day and a night.
3449	3451	Yet you came back for a second go at it.
3452	3455	It was a question of science, Doctor...
3455	3458	but you can imagine my joy when I discovered that the shock...
3458	3463	had permanently doubled my intellectual capacity.
3463	3467	Otherwise, my researches here would have come to nothing...
3467	3469	poor as they have been.
3471	3475	Recently I have turned up some rather puzzling indications...
3475	3478	that in those final days before their annihilation...
3478	3481	the Krell had been applying their entire racial energies...
3481	3483	to a new project...
3483	3485	one which they actually seemed to hope...
3485	3488	might somehow free them once and for all...
3488	3492	from any dependence on physical instrumentalities.
3492	3494	A civilization without instrumentalities?
3494	3495	Incredible.
3496	3499	Dr. Morbius, everything here is new.
3499	3502	Not a sign of age or wear on any of it.
3502	3507	Young man, these devices, self-serviced, self-maintained...
3507	3511	have stood exactly as you see them for 2,000 centuries.
3511	3513	2,000 centuries?
3513	3516	And during all this time, what was their power source?
3516	3518	That's a good question.
3518	3521	May I draw your attention to these gauges...
3521	3523	all around here, gentlemen?
3524	3526	Their calibrations appear to indicate...
3526	3528	that they are set in decimal series...
3528	3531	each division recording exactly ten times as many amperes...
3531	3533	as the one preceding it.
3533	3535	Ten times ten times ten times ten...
3535	3538	times ten times ten, on and on and on...
3538	3541	row after row, gauge after gauge.
3541	3545	But there is no direct wiring that I can discover.
3546	3548	However, when I activate this machine...
3548	3550	it registers infinitesimally, you see...
3550	3553	down there in the lower left-hand corner.
3553	3555	And then...
3555	3559	when I activate the educator here...
3561	3563	it registers a little more.
3563	3566	But this much is negligible.
3567	3570	The total potential here must be nothing less than astronomical.
3570	3572	Nothing less.
3572	3575	The number ten raised almost literally...
3575	3577	to the power of infinity.
3579	3583	Gentlemen, would you care to see some more of the Krell wonders?
3583	3585	- Indeed, yes. - Yes.
3585	3588	If you will, step in this shuttle car.
3602	3605	How often the Krell technicians have ridden in this little vehicle.
3607	3610	What now, Dr. Morbius?
3610	3612	Prepare your minds for a new scale...
3612	3614	of physical scientific values, gentlemen.
3663	3665	Twenty miles.
3666	3668	Twenty miles.
3670	3671	Listen.
3673	3674	Circuits opening and closing.
3674	3678	And they never rest. This is one of their ventilator shafts.
3678	3682	You can feel the warm air rising. Look down here.
3682	3684	Look down, gentlemen. Are you afraid?
3696	3698	7,800 levels.
3706	3710	And 400 other shafts like this one.
3744	3746	Yes, a single machine.
3746	3750	A cube 20 miles on each side.
3750	3754	For 2,000 centuries it has waited patiently here...
3754	3758	tuning and lubricating itself, replacing worn parts.
3758	3760	I have reason to believe that 16 years ago...
3760	3762	a minor alteration was performed...
3762	3766	throughout the entire 8,000 cubic miles of its own fabric.
3769	3771	But what's it all for?
3771	3774	Sometimes the gauges register a little...
3774	3777	when the buck deer fight in the autumn or when birds fly over in the spring...
3777	3779	and nearly a whole dial became active...
3779	3782	when your ship first approached from deep space.
3783	3785	I'll show you a section of one of the power units.
3788	3791	These units are sunk in the body of the planet...
3791	3794	fifty miles right below our feet.
3794	3797	Now, be sure and look only in the mirror.
3797	3800	Man does not behold the face of the Gorgon and live.
3809	3812	9,200 thermonuclear reactors in tandem.
3813	3817	The harnessed power of an exploding planetary system.
3825	3828	All hands, stand clear of fence area.
3828	3830	All right, Quinn, turn it on.
3832	3834	- Have you tested it yet, Bosun? - Right away, sir.
3844	3846	- There you are, sir. - Very good.
3851	3855	Lieutenant? Having completed my washing-up duties after chow...
3855	3858	I request the lieutenant's permission to take a walk...
3858	3860	outside the perimeter, sir.
3860	3862	- There's nothing out there. - But there is, sir.
3862	3866	I mean... well, I thought it might brighten the boys' mess up a bit...
3866	3871	if I could find a few wild radishes or something.
3871	3874	I don't know what you're lying about, but you better get back...
3874	3876	before the skipper does, or we'll both be skinned.
3876	3879	Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
3879	3882	Quinn, this is Farman. Kill the power on the fence.
3885	3887	All right, put it back on.
3906	3908	480 pints...
3908	3910	as you requested.
3911	3914	Total: 60 gallons.
3914	3916	Genuine Kansas City bourbon!
3922	3923	It's smooth too.
3932	3934	Robby, I ain't never gonna forget this.
3934	3937	Any time you're hard up for lube oil, let me know.
3944	3946	What's up? Somebody coming this way?
3948	3951	No, sir. Nothing coming this way.
3958	3959	The fence is shorting!
3965	3967	Shall I shut down the current, sir?
3967	3970	No. It's stopped now.
3970	3972	Check over the whole system in the morning.
3973	3974	Aye, sir.
4016	4019	It's strange how that fence just shorted out.
4030	4032	You're too arbitrary, Commander.
4032	4035	Perhaps I do not choose to be dictated to in my own world.
4035	4038	Dr. Morbius, a scientific find of this magnitude...
4038	4041	has got to be taken under United Planet supervision.
4041	4043	No one man can be allowed to monopolize it.
4043	4045	For the past two hours I've been expecting you...
4045	4047	to make exactly that asinine statement.
4047	4049	Just one moment, Commander.
4049	4051	For close on 20 years now I've been constantly...
4052	4055	and I hope dispassionately, considering this very problem...
4055	4057	and I have come to the unalterable conclusion...
4057	4060	that man is unfit as yet to receive such knowledge...
4060	4063	such almost limitless power.
4063	4066	Whereas Morbius, with his artificially expanded intellect...
4067	4070	is now ideally suited to administer this power for the whole human race.
4070	4072	Precisely, Doctor.
4072	4074	Such portions then of the Krell science...
4074	4076	as I may, from time to time, deem suitable and safe...
4076	4078	I shall dispense to Earth.
4078	4080	Other portions, I shall withhold.
4080	4083	And in this, I shall be answerable exclusively...
4083	4085	to my own conscience and judgment.
4086	4088	Dr. Morbius, in the absence of special instructions...
4088	4090	you leave me in a very awkward position.
4092	4094	- Commander Adams. - Speaking, Lieutenant.
4095	4096	Skipper, the chief's been murdered.
4098	4099	Quinn? Murdered?
4099	4101	Yes, he was alone, working on the monitor.
4101	4104	The rest of us were outside on guard duty. l...
4104	4106	- How was it done? - "Done"?
4106	4109	Skipper, his body is plastered all over the communications room.
4110	4112	Leave everything as it is. We're on our way.
4131	4133	It's started again.
4141	4142	Is that it?
4142	4146	I tried to make a plaster model from the footprints we found.
4151	4153	37 inches by 19.
4155	4157	Why, it's fantastic.
4160	4161	Doc, I don't understand.
4161	4165	Whatever walks on this would be quite an opponent for a man with a club...
4165	4167	but with our weapons, Quinn could have...
4167	4172	No. This thing runs counter to every known law of adaptive evolution.
4172	4174	What do you mean?
4175	4177	Notice this structure here.
4178	4181	Characteristic of a four-footed animal.
4181	4184	Yet our visitor last night left the tracks of a biped.
4185	4188	Primarily a ground animal too.
4188	4191	Yet this claw could only belong to an arboreal creature...
4191	4195	like some impossible tree sloth.
4195	4198	Just doesn't fit into normal nature anywhere in the galaxy.
4198	4199	This is a nightmare.
4199	4201	Is that what you made out of that footprint?
4201	4203	I think it's fairly close.
4205	4208	Pardon me, Commander. Are you ready to hold discipline on the cook, sir?
4208	4210	Yeah, let's have him.
4214	4218	I'm obliged to remind you that I gave him permission to go out last night.
4218	4220	Did you give him permission to get falling-down drunk?
4220	4222	Drunk, sir? Me, sir?
4222	4224	Ask Dr. Ostrow, sir.
4224	4227	Four pints of 120 proof bourbon without a trace of hangover in it.
4227	4229	That ain't natural.
4229	4233	Besides, why did that Robert argue me into drinking all that whiskey?
4233	4235	You were with the robot last night?
4235	4237	Yes, sir.
4237	4240	Him and me, we kind of got to toasting each other's good health...
4240	4243	just for cordial interplanetary relations, you understand.
4243	4247	Now, that's all the time? Even while the chief was being killed?
4247	4249	Certainly, sir.
4249	4252	I hope you don't think I got that stiff in five minutes.
4255	4256	All right. Dismissed.
4262	4265	I guess that kind of washes the robot up.
4265	4267	Where does that leave us for suspects?
4267	4269	Maybe it leaves us with the same one.
4269	4272	Maybe we should drop over to that Krell laboratory...
4272	4274	and get our IQs boosted a couple of hundred percent.
4274	4276	Sir, burial detail is ready.
4279	4282	Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
4286	4288	- Dismissed. - Company, dismissed.
4299	4300	Fine technician.
4302	4304	Good shipmate.
4304	4306	That's a good epitaph for any man.
4313	4315	Good day, Dr. Morbius.
4315	4318	I daresay neither of us slept any last night.
4318	4321	That's a pretty close guess.
4321	4324	I warned you while your ship was still in space.
4324	4326	I begged you not to land on this planet.
4327	4330	Believe me, Commander, that is only a foretaste.
4330	4333	The Belerephon pattern is being woven again.
4334	4338	Remain here and the next attack on your party...
4338	4343	will be more deadly and general.
4343	4345	How do you know that?
4347	4349	Know? l...
4349	4352	I seem to visualize it.
4355	4357	If you wish, call it...
4358	4360	a premonition.
4375	4377	What do you make of that, Skipper?
4377	4379	I'd say it sounded like an ultimatum.
4380	4382	- Bosun. - Aye, sir.
4386	4389	Bosun. I want a clear field of fire in all directions.
4389	4391	- Aye, aye, sir. - Randall?
4391	4393	How soon will radar be operational?
4393	4396	- Operating right now, sir. - Good. Keep on it yourself.
4396	4398	- Aye, aye, sir. - The M.A. alert is completed?
4399	4401	- Aye, aye, sir. - Fine.
4401	4403	Activate main batteries.
4409	4411	Alarm for test.
4419	4420	Fire!
4432	4434	Check good.
4439	4441	Lieutenant, you got your trouble squad in hand?
4441	4443	Yes, sir, but they're a little trigger-happy.
4443	4446	They're sort of edgy to see whatever's out there.
4448	4449	Oh, Jerry.
4453	4456	This may be a big deal coming up.
4457	4459	I'm sorry if I've leaned on you...
4460	4463	Stop knocking yourself out, Skipper. She picked the right man.
4467	4470	- What is it, Randall? - Radar just picked up something.
4470	4472	- Where away? - At the head of the arroyo.
4472	4474	- Moving? - This way. Slowly.
4481	4482	Automatic control.
4488	4490	Batteries, fire!
4495	4496	Batteries, hold fire.
4498	4500	Do you see anything out there?
4501	4502	Nothing.
4504	4506	Batteries, fire!
4511	4513	Batteries, cease fire.
4514	4516	- Randall. - Dead on target, sir.
4516	4518	Good.
4518	4520	- Give me audio-com. - Aye, aye, sir.
4520	4522	Attention!
4522	4525	This may have been a ruse to divert us from some other part of the perimeter.
4525	4527	Continue watching on your own immediate fronts.
4527	4529	That is all.
4535	4537	What?
4537	4539	It just stopped at the foot of the pass.
4539	4541	Are you sure you've got a real blip there?
4541	4544	Big as a house, and we were on target with both bursts.
4544	4546	It's coming on again!
4546	4548	- Straight across? - It shows here.
4549	4550	It's still coming!
4550	4552	Gray, Strong, set up a cross fire on those rocks.
4587	4589	Fire!
4591	4593	The blasted thing's invisible!
4638	4640	Jerry! Hold fire!
4649	4651	Fire!
4675	4677	Father!
4677	4679	Alta!
4684	4685	- Alta, where are you? - Father!
4686	4687	What is it? What's the matter?
4688	4690	I just had a terrible dream!
4690	4692	There was blood and fire and thunder...
4692	4696	and something awful was moving in the middle of it.
4696	4698	I could hear it roar and bellow.
4699	4701	Now, now. You know a dream can't hurt you.
4701	4704	Not me. Not us.
4704	4706	The thing I saw was trying to break in the camp.
4706	4708	It was gonna kill...
4708	4712	You'll take care of him for me, won't you? You'll protect him.
4712	4717	My darling, I'm completely helpless as long as he remains here so willfully.
4717	4718	Come now.
4728	4730	- Bosun. - Yes, sir?
4733	4735	Get those graves dug. Keep the men busy.
4735	4737	- The busier the better. - Randall?
4739	4740	Give me audio-com.
4742	4746	Well, men, whatever it was, our main battery stopped it.
4748	4749	You believe that?
4751	4753	No, it just went away for some reason. It'll be back.
4755	4758	Doc, an invisible being...
4758	4761	that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.
4762	4766	No, Skipper. That is a scientific impossibility.
4766	4768	Hypnotic illusions don't tear people apart.
4768	4770	That's true enough...
4770	4774	but any organism dense enough to survive three billion electron volts...
4774	4779	would have to be made of solid nuclear material.
4779	4781	It would sink of its own weight to the center of this planet.
4781	4784	You saw it yourself standing there in those neutron beams.
4784	4785	There's your answer.
4785	4787	It must have been renewing its molecular structure...
4788	4790	from one microsecond to the next.
4794	4797	- Bosun! I want the tractor. - Ready, sir.
4797	4800	We pick up the girl and her father whether they like it or not.
4800	4802	Section 86A:
4802	4804	"Evacuate all civilians from disaster areas."
4804	4807	You left out two very important words.
4807	4809	"Where feasible."
4809	4812	If you remember the Belerephon expedition...
4812	4814	their ship was vaporized trying to lift off.
4814	4817	Which makes it a gilt-edged priority that one of us...
4817	4820	gets into that Krell lab and takes that brain boost.
4822	4824	- Bosun. - Aye, sir?
4826	4828	I'm leaving you in command. Get the ship operational.
4828	4831	Do your best to wait it out for me and the doctor...
4831	4834	but the second that fence starts to short again, lift off...
4834	4838	and report back to Earth base on conditions in this sector.
4838	4839	Right, Skipper.
4851	4855	All right. Get everything aboard ship. We're pullin' out!
4878	4880	No lights showing.
4884	4888	Look, Doc, in case we make it into that lab...
4888	4890	I'll take the first go at the IQ booster.
4892	4893	You hear me?
4893	4895	I hear you.
4911	4914	I am monitored to admit no one at this hour.
4917	4919	That sounded final.
4922	4924	Maybe if we reasoned with him.
4930	4933	My beams are focused on your blasters, gentlemen.
4943	4947	Hasn't he got a built-in rule against wringing our necks for us?
4948	4950	That is true, sir.
4950	4953	Yet I am monitored to admit no one.
4957	4960	- Let them in. - This is your father's order.
4960	4962	- Get out of the way. - Quiet.
4964	4967	Emergency cancellation Archimedes.
4973	4975	Why are you here?
4977	4979	We were attacked.
4979	4981	Three more men dead, including Jerry Farman.
4990	4992	I don't know. It was...
4992	4996	just some kind of big outline in the disintegrator beams.
4997	4999	And you can't explain it?
5002	5004	Well, anyway, we fought it, and we lost.
5004	5007	- I figure it'll be back. - You must leave, now.
5008	5009	I'm not going without you.
5009	5012	But I can't possibly leave him alone. I just can't.
5013	5015	- Then we'll take him. - By force?
5015	5017	I can't agree to that either.
5017	5020	Can't you? You don't realize what's loose on this planet!
5020	5022	But I'm immune, like both my parents.
5022	5024	That's what he says. Nothing could be immune to that thing...
5024	5027	Oh, darling, please go.
5033	5035	Oh, please. If you love me, go.
5035	5040	Alta. Doc, will you talk some sense to this girl?
5040	5042	I'm in over my head. Doc?
5043	5044	Doc?
5049	5051	On the sofa, Robby.
5062	5064	So you took the brain boost, huh?
5065	5067	You oughta see my new mind.
5069	5072	Up there in lights. Bigger than his now.
5074	5076	Easy, Doc.
5076	5079	Morbius was too close to the problem.
5080	5083	The Krell had completed their project.
5084	5085	That big machine.
5086	5087	No instrumentalities.
5088	5090	True creation.
5091	5092	Doc, let's have it.
5093	5095	- But the Krell forgot one thing. - Yes, what?
5097	5098	Monsters, John.
5099	5101	Monsters from the Id.
5101	5103	The Id? What's that?
5104	5105	Talk, Doc.
5110	5111	Doc?
5133	5135	How romantic!
5140	5142	The fool! The meddling idiot!
5142	5146	As though his ape's brain could contain the secrets of the Krell.
5147	5150	Father, he's dead.
5150	5153	He was warned, and now he's paid.
5153	5156	Let him be buried with the other victims of human greed and folly.
5162	5166	Morbius, you wanted me to make a choice.
5167	5169	Now you've chosen for me.
5170	5172	I'm ready to go with you, darling.
5174	5176	I will place him in the tractor, sir.
5176	5178	Thank you.
5179	5181	She mustn't do this. She must be prevented.
5181	5183	Morbius, what is the Id?
5183	5187	My daughter is planning a very foolish action, and she'll be terribly punished.
5187	5189	- What is the Id? - Id! Id! Id!
5192	5194	It's an obsolete term...
5195	5197	I'm afraid, once used to describe...
5197	5201	the elementary basis of the subconscious mind.
5204	5206	Monsters from the Id.
5208	5211	Monsters from the subconscious.
5213	5216	Of course. That's what Doc meant.
5219	5222	The big machine... 8,000 cubic miles of Klystron relays...
5222	5224	enough power for a whole population of creative geniuses...
5224	5227	operated by remote control.
5227	5230	Morbius, operated by the electromagnetic impulses...
5230	5232	of individual Krell brains.
5232	5234	To what purpose?
5234	5237	In return, that machine would instantaneously project solid matter...
5237	5240	to any point on the planet, in any shape or color they might imagine...
5240	5242	for any purpose, Morbius!
5243	5245	Creation by mere thought.
5245	5248	Why haven't I seen this all along?
5249	5252	Like you, the Krell forgot one deadly danger...
5252	5256	their own subconscious hate and lust for destruction.
5257	5259	The beast. The mindless primitive.
5261	5264	Even the Krell must have evolved from that beginning.
5265	5268	And so those mindless beasts of the subconscious...
5268	5271	had access to a machine that could never be shut down.
5271	5274	The secret devil of every soul on the planet...
5274	5277	all set free at once to loot and maim...
5278	5280	and take revenge and kill!
5282	5284	My poor Krell!
5288	5291	After a million years of shining sanity...
5294	5297	they could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.
5302	5303	Yes, young man.
5305	5309	All very convincing but for one obvious fallacy.
5311	5315	The last Krell died 2,000 centuries ago...
5315	5317	but today, as we all know...
5317	5320	there is still at large on this planet a living monster.
5322	5326	Your mind refuses to face a conclusion.
5326	5327	What do you mean?
5327	5327	What do you mean?
5332	5333	- Morbius! - What?
5334	5336	Something is approaching from the southwest.
5336	5338	It is now quite close.
5351	5353	- Could Robby be wrong? - No, never.
5357	5359	There it comes.
5371	5374	I feel sorry for you, young man.
5374	5376	Feel sorry for your daughter, Morbius.
5380	5381	It's listening.
5387	5390	- Alta, go into my study. - You still refuse to face the truth.
5390	5393	- What truth? - Morbius, that thing out there.
5394	5395	- It's you. - You're insane!
5396	5398	You have led it here where Alta must see you torn to pieces!
5398	5401	You think she's immune? She's joined herself to me!
5401	5403	- Yes, and whatever comes, forever. - Say it's a lie.
5404	5406	Let it hear you! Tell it you don't love this man!
5406	5409	Not even if I could.
5413	5416	Stop it, Robby! Don't let it in! Kill it!
5427	5429	It's no use.
5429	5431	He knows it's your other self.
5461	5462	We're safe.
5463	5466	Why did you jumble that combination?
5466	5469	Whatever you know in here, your twin self in the tunnel knows too.
5469	5471	I'm not a monster, you...
5473	5476	We're all part monsters in our subconscious!
5476	5479	- So we have laws and religion. - Let me go!
5479	5482	You've got to listen. We don't have much time.
5485	5487	Here's where your mind was artificially enlarged.
5487	5491	Consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine...
5491	5493	but your subconscious had been made strong enough!
5493	5496	- I won't hear you! - You've got to listen!
5496	5499	Twenty years ago, when your comrades voted to return to Earth...
5499	5503	you sent your secret Id out to murder them!
5507	5511	Not quite realizing it, of course, except maybe in your dreams.
5512	5515	What man can remember his own dreams?
5515	5519	At least when we approached from space, you remembered enough to warn us off.
5519	5523	But when you thought we were a threat to your little egomaniac empire...
5523	5527	your subconscious sent its Id monster out again!
5527	5530	More deaths, Morbius. More murder!
5530	5533	And now this too? Harm my own daughter?
5534	5536	But now she's defying you, Morbius...
5536	5539	and even in you, the loving father, there still exists...
5539	5540	the mindless primitive...
5541	5544	more enraged and more inflamed with each new frustration.
5544	5547	So now you're whistling up your monster again...
5547	5549	to punish her for her disloyalty and disobedience!
5551	5554	And if you don't do something about it soon...
5554	5557	it's going to be coming right through that door.
5562	5566	Solid Krell metal, 26 inches thick.
5566	5569	Look at your gauges. Look!
5569	5571	That machine is going to supply your monster...
5571	5574	with whatever amount of power it requires to reach us.
5575	5577	Look now!
5586	5589	Red-hot. Soon it'll be white-hot.
5589	5591	Then it'll soften and melt.
5602	5606	Alta, say you don't believe this of me! Tell me you don't!
5618	5620	Then it must be true.
5621	5623	Yes, I must be guilty!
5623	5625	Then help us, darling!
5625	5629	I've known you great and noble like the Krell.
5646	5648	Guilty! Guilty!
5648	5653	My evil self is at that door, and I have no power to stop it!
5684	5687	Stop! No further! I deny you! I give you up!
5708	5711	Father. Oh, Father.
5715	5716	Son...
5718	5719	turn that disc.
5727	5729	The switch. Throw it.
5738	5740	In 24 hours...
5741	5746	you must be 100 million miles out in space.
5749	5752	The Krell furnaces...
5752	5754	Chain reaction...
5754	5756	They cannot be reversed. Alta!
5773	5776	98.6 million. We're clear now.
5779	5781	Quite an astrogator.
5782	5785	A genuine privilege, Commander.
5785	5787	Activate main view-plate.
5787	5789	Aye, aye, Skipper.
5791	5795	That's Altair-4, the bright speck below the star.
5797	5799	Fifteen seconds.
5803	5807	Yes, Alta, your father, my shipmates...
5807	5809	all the stored knowledge of the Krell.
5810	5813	Five seconds, four...
5813	5816	three, two, one...
5827	5833	Alta, about a million years from now the human race...
5833	5836	will have crawled up to where the Krell stood...
5836	5840	in their great moment of triumph and tragedy.
5846	5849	And your father's name will shine again...
5849	5851	like a beacon in the galaxy.
5853	5857	It's true, it will remind us...
5858	5860	that we are, after all, not God.
