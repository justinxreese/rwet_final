19	21	Central Services
21	25	We do the work, you do the pleasure
26	29	Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.
29	32	Do your ducts seem old-fashioned...
32	34	out-of-date?
34	37	Central Services' new duct designs...
37	40	are now available in hundreds of different colors...
40	42	to suit your individual taste.
43	48	Hurry now, while stocks last, to your nearest Central Services showroom.
49	52	Designer colors to suit your demanding taste.
72	75	We have here from the Ministry of Information...
75	78	Deputy Minister Eugene Helpmann.
78	80	Good evening, David.
80	84	What d'you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
84	86	Bad sportsmanship.
86	88	A ruthless minority of people...
88	92	seems to have forgotten certain good old-fashioned virtues.
92	96	They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win.
96	98	If these people would just play the game...
98	100	they'd get a lot more out of life.
100	103	Nevertheless, there are those who maintain...
103	107	that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy.
107	109	In free society, information is the name of the game.
110	112	You can't win the game if you're a man short.
112	116	The cost of it all, seven percent of the gross national product.
116	120	I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayers.
120	123	People want value for money. That is why we always insist...
123	127	on the principle of Information Retrieval Charges.
128	130	It's absolutely right and fair...
130	133	that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention...
134	138	and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation.
138	142	Do you believe the government is winning against terrorists?
142	143	Oh, yes.
145	148	We're fielding all their strokes, running all of them out...
148	151	and pretty consistently knocking them for six.
153	156	I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
163	167	HELPMANN: Have to subsidize.
167	171	Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year.
171	173	Beginner's luck.
174	176	Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
176	180	Thank you, David. And a very merry Christmas to you all.
183	185	"Scrooge was better than his word.
185	188	"He did it all, and infinitely more.
188	191	"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die...
191	194	"he became a second father.
194	198	"He became as good a friend, in the good old world.
198	201	"And so, as Tiny Tim observed...
202	204	"God bless us, everyone."
209	211	Are you boys giving me the runaround?
211	214	Now, I have to say, "Hey, hey."
214	216	Don't throw that. That's only for long distance.
217	220	I'm sorry, we haven't any vacancies. No vacancies?
220	222	We've got plenty of rooms...
233	235	Who's there?
238	239	Who is that?
240	243	Father Christmas can't come if we haven't got a chimney.
244	245	You'll see.
293	295	"I hereby inform you, under powers entrusted to me...
295	299	"under Section 47, Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number 438476...
299	303	"that Mr. Buttle, Archibald, residing in 412 North Tower, Shangri-La Towers...
303	306	"is invited to assist the Ministry of Information with inquiries.
306	310	"And that he is liable to financial obligations as specified in...
310	314	"Council Order RBICZl907IX."
314	316	Sign here, please.
318	320	Where are you taking him?
321	322	There.
324	325	Thank you.
325	327	Same again, please.
328	330	Press harder this time. Good.
331	333	What is this all about?
334	336	That is your receipt for your husband. Thank you.
336	339	This is my receipt for your receipt.
339	341	Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?
345	348	We're Department of Works! Department of Works up here.
349	352	Careful with those bloody things. Sure.
352	354	Don't take any notice of them.
354	356	Don't touch me! Why don't you just get out of here.
357	359	Don't you worry. We'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.
360	361	Nothing to worry about.
361	364	It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.
364	367	Tuttle? His name's Buttle. There must be some mistake.
367	370	Mistake? We don't make mistakes.
373	376	Bloody typical. They've gone back to metric without telling us.
377	379	Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?
379	380	Yes...
467	469	Buttle.
472	474	Buttle, Archibald.
482	483	Oh, shit!
486	487	Mister...
489	492	Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.
527	529	Has anybody seen Lowry?
532	535	Has anybody seen...
535	537	Sam Lowry?
571	572	Sam.
608	610	Hello? Sam. Where are you?
610	611	Hello? It's 11:00.
612	614	- What? - It's 11:00.
614	616	Mr. Kurtzmann.
617	619	You're up late.
620	621	Is it?
626	629	- The electrics here are up the spout. - Yeah, I know.
629	631	- Yours, too? - Yes.
632	635	I'll be there as soon as I can. Yes, thanks. 'Bye.
695	697	This is not the only statue.
699	700	What's this gun for?
701	704	This one, Sister, is a nine millimeter submachine gun...
704	708	used for close-quarter combat fighting. Very effective weapon.
708	710	Would you like to see it?
738	739	Sam!
741	742	Jack!
744	746	Long time no see.
748	749	What are you doing here?
749	751	Didn't expect to see you slumming it in Records.
751	753	- What's the problem? - Problem? No problem.
754	755	Everything's fine. Marvelous.
755	758	Alison's in great shape, kids are fine. I'm on Security Level 5...
759	762	so Mr. Helpmann relies on me more and more. It's been a great year.
762	764	You sound worried.
764	767	Worried? Me? If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.
768	770	Sam, whatever happened to you?
770	772	Records...
783	784	Sam?
787	790	Jack, it's great to see you. I'm going to be late.
790	793	Sam, let a friend tell you your life is going wrong.
793	797	Records is a dead-end department. No security that's worth a damn.
797	800	- It's impossible to get noticed. - I know. Wonderful.
800	802	Marvelous. Perfect.
802	805	See you, Jack. Give my regards to Alison and the twins.
805	807	- Triplets. - Triplets?
807	810	God, how time flies.
812	816	A very clear delineation of picture, is it not? Mobile.
816	817	Next!
822	824	I want to report a wrongful arrest.
824	827	You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
827	830	I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here.
830	833	They said you have a form I need to fill out.
833	836	- Have you got an arrest receipt? - Yeah.
837	839	Is it stamped?
840	841	Stamped?
843	845	No, there's no stamp on it, you see.
846	849	I can't let you have the form until this is stamped.
849	851	Where do I get it stamped?
851	853	Information Adjustments.
865	867	It's nothing.
870	873	It keeps picking up old films. That can't be right, can it?
873	875	Perhaps the machine's on the blink.
875	879	It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers.
879	883	Tuttle should've had £31.06 debited against his account, not Buttle.
884	886	- My God, a mistake! - At least it's not ours.
887	889	Isn't it? Whose is it?
889	891	- Information Retrieval. - Good.
891	894	Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of...
894	897	Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.
897	901	But Security has invoiced Admin. For Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.
901	904	What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.
905	906	Thanks.
908	910	I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
910	914	- God, don't worry about that. - But if they did promote you...
916	918	I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
918	920	- Would you, really? - Really.
922	923	You've been promoted.
927	930	It's your mother, isn't it? Pulling strings again.
935	938	Sam, it's time for you to grow up and accept responsibility.
939	942	Your poor father would be appalled at your lack of promotion.
943	946	Mother, I just wish you would stop interfering.
947	950	I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
950	953	No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.
953	956	He doesn't have your brains, but he's got the ambition.
956	961	You haven't got the ambition. Luckily, you've got me and the Deputy Minister.
961	966	- Mr. Helpmann was very close to your father. - Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.
966	969	Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception. You're giving her wrinkles.
969	971	- You see? - God!
971	973	Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.
974	976	I'll make you 20 years younger.
976	979	Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.
979	981	Would you like to be Surgeon General?
981	984	I know simply everybody.
984	987	They won't know you when I've finished with you.
988	990	First...
990	992	we remove the excess derma.
995	998	Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes and forehead.
1002	1005	Now, I lift...
1006	1008	the wrinkles and the worry lines...
1008	1011	right up into the wig, into the hairline.
1013	1015	Now the template.
1017	1020	Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ca!
1021	1024	Already she's twice as beautiful as she was before.
1024	1025	Voila!
1027	1029	Mr. Helpmann was very close to your poor father.
1029	1032	He was close to me. He still is.
1034	1038	He'll take you under his wing when you get to Information Retrieval.
1038	1040	You'll like it there.
1040	1043	You're not listening to me, Mother.
1047	1049	SECURITY GUARD: What the hell is this, lady?
1049	1052	It's a present for my son. Really!
1052	1055	I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
1057	1059	What on earth is it?
1059	1062	Something for an executive.
1065	1069	Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today. Merry Christmas.
1069	1071	Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
1072	1075	- You remember my son, Samuel? - Of course.
1075	1076	We're joining Mrs. Terrain.
1077	1078	Yes, they're waiting.
1085	1088	- Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk. - We will.
1088	1092	Ida! She's got what's-her-name with her.
1094	1097	Well, Alma, how are you?
1097	1099	You look wonderful.
1099	1101	Hello, Shirley.
1101	1103	Thank you, Spiro.
1104	1105	- Salt? - Not yet.
1106	1109	Sam, Happy Christmas.
1111	1113	So sorry we're late. Thanks.
1113	1115	Now, Alma...
1115	1117	what are you going to have?
1117	1120	I can't make up my mind whether to have the number one or the number two.
1120	1122	What do you recommend, Spiro?
1122	1124	Between you and me, madame...
1124	1127	- today the number two. - Thank you, Spiro.
1127	1129	Shirley, what are you going to have?
1129	1133	Between you and me, mademoiselle, today the number one.
1133	1135	Madam Lowry?
1135	1139	To hell with the diet! I'm going to have a number eight, please.
1139	1142	- A most perceptive choice, if I may say so. - Oh, Ida...
1142	1144	- Monsieur? - Steak, please, rare. Mother...
1144	1147	- Monsieur, quel numero? - I don't know which number.
1147	1149	- Mother, please... - That one. There.
1149	1151	Thanks. Mother, will you...
1151	1155	Alma! You wicked girl. You've started your treatments.
1155	1157	- Say the number, please. - You noticed.
1157	1160	- You have to say the number! - Go away!
1160	1161	I must tell you all about it.
1162	1163	Number three.
1165	1169	- Mother, will you listen to me? - Numero huit.
1170	1174	Braised veal in wine sauce.
1176	1181	It's too exciting. I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
1181	1183	MAITRE D': Numero deux, duck a I'orange.
1183	1185	MOTHER: Chapman? MAITRE D': Excusez-moi.
1185	1188	The acid man?
1188	1191	Really, Ida. Just because his techniques are revolutionary.
1191	1194	I don't go around calling Dr. Jaffe the knife man.
1194	1197	MAITRE D': Numero un, crevettes a la mayonnaise.
1197	1199	I am sorry, Alma.
1199	1202	- I didn't mean to... - It's all right, Ida.
1202	1204	Steak. Numero trois!
1206	1208	Mesdames, monsieur...
1209	1211	bon appetit!
1211	1213	- Merci! - Merci!
1213	1217	Acid, on the other hand, can be used for such wonderfully subtle shading...
1218	1220	such delicate nuances.
1220	1223	Like a Rembrandt etching. And it is so much quicker.
1223	1227	If it wasn't for this complication, it could've happened to anybody...
1227	1230	I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.
1231	1232	Shirley.
1233	1234	Salt?
1257	1258	What were we saying?
1258	1260	God, this isn't rare.
1260	1265	By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemist's.
1265	1268	Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
1268	1269	That sounds marvelous!
1270	1273	It's good at any doctor's and most of the major hospitals.
1273	1277	It's also accepted for gynecological examinations...
1277	1279	including Caesarian sections.
1279	1282	- Spiro. - Madam, I don't know what to say.
1282	1286	This never happens to us. I'm going to do something about it straightaway.
1286	1290	Sam, can't you do something about these terrorists?
1290	1292	It's my lunch hour.
1293	1295	Besides, it's not my department.
1295	1299	Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I've been dying to tell you.
1300	1304	Sam's being promoted to Information Retrieval.
1304	1308	Why, that's wonderful! Congratulations, Sam.
1308	1312	Stop it! I'm not being promoted. I'm not going to Information Retrieval.
1312	1316	If I wanted to upset you, Mother, I'd tell you where to stick it.
1319	1320	Pepper?
1323	1324	I've got to go.
1324	1326	You haven't had your dessert.
1326	1329	I don't want dessert, promotion or anything!
1329	1333	Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?
1333	1336	No, nothing. Not even dreams.
1346	1347	Sam.
1379	1380	Sam!
1419	1421	Oh, God!
1443	1445	Hello. Central Services?
1445	1448	I'm at 579B, Block 19, Northwestern Section D.
1448	1451	Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover.
1451	1455	I've got trouble with my air conditioning. It's an emergency.
1455	1458	Thanks for calling Central Services. I'm sorry, due to staff shortages...
1459	1463	Central Services cannot take service calls between 2300 and 0900 hours.
1463	1465	Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.
1465	1467	This is an emergency!
1467	1471	- Thank you for calling Central Services... - Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.
1472	1474	- Thank you for calling Central Services. - Oh, shit!
1498	1499	Hello.
1509	1510	Hello. Hello.
1520	1521	Hello, Mr. Lowry.
1521	1523	Yes, who is this?
1524	1526	Put the phone down and raise your hands.
1527	1529	What? Who is this?
1532	1534	Nice and easy, now.
1540	1542	Just keep your hands where I can see them.
1567	1569	What are you doing?
1572	1576	Harry Tuttle, heating engineer, at your service.
1579	1580	Tuttle?
1582	1584	Are you from Central Services?
1590	1591	I called Central Services.
1591	1593	They're overworked these days.
1593	1596	Luckily, I intercepted your call.
1597	1598	You did...
1599	1602	Just a minute. What was that business with the gun?
1603	1605	Just a precaution, sir.
1607	1609	I've had traps set for me before now.
1610	1614	Plenty of people in Central Services would love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
1616	1619	Are you telling me that this is illegal?
1625	1626	Well, yes and no.
1626	1628	Officially, only Central Services can touch this stuff.
1628	1630	Would you hold this, please?
1630	1633	But nowadays, with all the new rules and regulations...
1633	1635	they can't get decent staff anymore.
1635	1637	They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.
1637	1641	But if they could prove that I've been working on their equipment...
1641	1643	that's a plate of a different color.
1643	1645	- Wouldn't it be simpler just to... - Hold this, please.
1645	1647	Sorry, yes.
1647	1650	I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler to work with Central Services?
1650	1652	I couldn't stand the...
1654	1656	- It's getting warm. - You couldn't stand the what?
1656	1658	I couldn't stand the paperwork.
1658	1659	Listen...
1659	1663	this system of yours could be on fire, and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap...
1663	1665	without filling out a 27Bl6.
1666	1667	Bloody paperwork.
1668	1670	I suppose one has to expect a certain amount.
1670	1673	Why? I came into this for the action, the excitement.
1673	1677	Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out, wherever there's trouble. A man alone.
1679	1683	They've got the whole country sectioned off. Can't make a move without a form.
1698	1700	Found it. There's your problem.
1701	1703	- Can you fix it? - No, I can't.
1703	1706	But I can bypass it with one of these.
1708	1710	Fine by me.
1715	1717	- Are you expecting anyone? - No.
1722	1723	Wait here. Wait.
1730	1732	The flashlight.
1735	1737	- Central Services. - Central Services.
1737	1740	- Yes. - You rang, sir.
1740	1742	Trouble with your air conditioning?
1743	1744	No, it's all right.
1747	1748	It's fixed.
1749	1750	It's fixed?
1750	1754	Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.
1754	1755	Fixed itself, did it?
1757	1758	Yes.
1759	1761	Machines don't fix themselves.
1763	1765	He's tampered with it.
1766	1769	Sorry you had a wasted journey.
1770	1772	I think we ought to have a look.
1775	1777	Have you got a 27Bl6?
1777	1778	A 27Bl6?
1786	1789	Now look what you've done to him.
1790	1792	Have you got a 27Bl6?
1792	1794	Not as such.
1796	1798	But we'll get one.
1799	1801	It's all right, it's all right.
1801	1804	Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.
1804	1807	Where would we be if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?
1807	1809	We'll be back.
1810	1811	We'll be back!
1816	1818	Thanks for coming.
1818	1820	We'll be back, you clever bastard!
1820	1823	Thank you. SPOOR: We'll show you.
1830	1833	Thanks, Lowry. You're a good man in a tight corner.
1842	1844	I just happen to work at the Ministry of Information.
1844	1845	What?
1847	1849	I just happen to know that...
1850	1853	Information Retrieval are looking for an Archibald Tuttle...
1854	1855	heating engineer.
1858	1861	You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?
1863	1865	My good friends call me Harry.
1867	1869	Information Retrieval?
1869	1871	The big boys.
1876	1878	What do they want you for?
1883	1885	Time to go.
1885	1887	How's that?
1892	1895	You really must let me give you something.
1898	1901	How much will it be for the work?
1903	1906	Come on. You did me a favor. Just check the corridor.
1909	1910	Thanks.
1911	1913	Listen, kid. We're all in this together.
1913	1915	Go on.
1928	1929	All clear.
1957	1960	I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.
1963	1965	What's playing today?
1965	1967	Casablanca.
1967	1970	Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.
1973	1974	Lowry!
1976	1978	Now, Mr. Lowry!
1990	1993	Thank God you're here. We're in terrible trouble.
2001	2002	Look at this.
2002	2005	- It's a check. - It's the refund for Tuttle.
2005	2006	Tuttle?
2008	2010	Buttle. I mean Buttle.
2010	2012	It's been confusion from the word go.
2012	2015	He was overcharged for Information Retrieval procedures.
2015	2018	And someone, somewhere, is trying to make us carry the can.
2018	2021	Can I have a look? I've never seen a refund check before.
2021	2023	I'll bet it's Jeffries.
2025	2026	Yes.
2027	2030	He believes that people should pay more for their interrogation.
2030	2032	And B: He loathes me.
2032	2034	We've got to get rid of it.
2034	2037	Send it to somebody else. Better still, send it to Buttle.
2037	2038	After all, it's his check.
2038	2041	I've tried that. Look at this.
2041	2042	You see?
2042	2045	The population census has got him down as dormanted.
2045	2049	The Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted.
2049	2052	- Hang on. - Information Retrieval's got him inoperative.
2052	2055	Security has got him down as excised.
2055	2058	- Administration's got him as completed. - He's dead.
2060	2061	Dead?
2063	2065	Well, that's awful.
2069	2072	We'll never get rid of the damn thing now.
2073	2075	What are we going to do, Sam?
2075	2077	Could try the next of kin.
2084	2087	There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."
2087	2088	Veronica?
2089	2091	What's the number on the check?
2091	2095	27156789...
2097	2100	l074328K.
2103	2105	Right into memory.
2106	2108	Central Banking.
2109	2111	Veronica Buttle...
2112	2113	Mrs.
2114	2115	Deposit.
2130	2131	Thank God for that.
2132	2134	Would you like some tea?
2143	2145	There's a problem.
2145	2147	She doesn't have a bank account.
2151	2153	Well, that's it then.
2154	2157	I might just as well go and hang myself now.
2159	2164	This could never have happened before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.
2164	2165	That's Simmons' doing.
2166	2168	He and Jeffries always sit together at lunch.
2168	2169	Bastards!
2175	2179	Perhaps we could lose the thing behind a filing cabinet or something...
2179	2183	- or burn it, eat it... - Look. There is one solution.
2183	2185	- What? - Drive out to Mrs. Buttle...
2185	2189	let her sign at the back of the check. She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.
2190	2192	That's brilliant, Sam.
2192	2194	I'll even do it for you.
2194	2196	Here, authorize the check. What's the address?
2196	2198	Everything's in here.
2201	2203	What shall I do next?
2205	2206	Pink and blue receipts.
2206	2210	Sign there, there and there. And sign the check there.
2215	2218	I think I've broken a bone.
2218	2222	My wrist is all limp. What a pathetic creature I am!
2224	2226	I'll do it for you.
2244	2246	Right. I'll be on my way.
2249	2250	Sam?
2253	2256	You are good to me, you know.
2256	2259	Here's looking at you, kid. Here's looking at you.
2263	2266	Brazil
2266	2271	Where hearts were entertained in June
2271	2276	We stood beneath that amber moon
2276	2280	We interrupt this program to bring you news of a terrorist bombing...
2280	2281	at the Blue Lagoon...
2284	2289	And clung together, then
2290	2294	Tomorrow was another day
2296	2300	The morning found me miles away
2300	2305	With still a million things to say
2306	2310	And now
2310	2314	when twilight beams the sky above
2320	2323	Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...
2323	2324	Piss off!
2329	2330	Hello.
2332	2333	I'll never confess!
2339	2342	BOY 2: Come on, you've got to interrogate me.
2367	2368	Mrs. Buttle?
2372	2374	Mrs. Buttle?
2382	2384	Are you Mrs. Buttle?
2391	2393	My name is Lowry.
2395	2396	Sam Lowry.
2399	2401	I'm from the Ministry of Information.
2404	2406	I've come to give you a check.
2411	2414	It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.
2415	2416	Mistake?
2416	2420	Yes. Not my department, of course. I'm only Records.
2422	2427	I'll tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval.
2427	2430	They don't usually make mistakes...
2431	2433	but I suppose we're all human.
2437	2439	What happened to the...
2444	2446	Actually, my coming here is rather unorthodox.
2446	2451	Bringing you this check. Any payments are normally made through Central Computer...
2451	2453	but as there were certain...
2454	2457	difficulties, we thought, rather than cause delay...
2458	2460	we'd let you have it now.
2460	2462	It being Christmas and all.
2463	2466	My husband's dead, isn't he?
2468	2472	I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle, the Ministry is very scrupulous...
2472	2474	about following up and eradicating any error.
2474	2477	But if you do have any complaints you wish to make...
2477	2481	I'd be only too happy to send you the appropriate forms.
2481	2484	What have you done with his body?
2490	2494	I don't know anything about that. I'm really just...
2494	2496	delivering the check. So if...
2496	2500	Look, if you wouldn't mind just signing these two receipts...
2501	2504	I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.
2505	2507	He hadn't done anything.
2507	2508	He was good!
2510	2514	What have you done with his body?
2521	2524	It isn't being very helpful, is it?
2531	2534	I didn't have to come here, you know, Mrs. Buttle.
2535	2537	I'll kill you, you bastard!
2539	2541	Stop it!
2551	2553	Are you all right?
2554	2556	Are you all right?
2560	2562	Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?
2562	2564	It's you.
2564	2566	Wait, stop! Don't go!
2636	2639	Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!
2639	2641	Stop!
2646	2648	YOUNG GIRL: He's coming back!
2663	2665	- Go away. - Her name's Jill.
2666	2667	What?
2667	2669	Jill?
2669	2670	Jill who?
2671	2672	Jill who?
2673	2674	Layton.
2676	2678	Jill Layton.
2679	2681	You're a very good little girl.
2681	2684	- What are you doing here? - Waiting for my daddy.
2684	2687	He will be pleased when he gets home.
2730	2734	Sam, I've just had the transport pool onto me.
2734	2737	You don't know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing, do you?
2737	2739	Personnel transporter?
2739	2740	What?
2741	2743	The pranets, I had a personal transporter.
2743	2746	I'll do the paperwork in the morning.
2747	2750	Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...
2750	2752	Buttle's check?
2753	2754	- Can I forget it? - Yeah.
2755	2758	What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.
2761	2762	Damn! Blast!
2763	2765	What's the matter?
2765	2768	You don't happen to know how to get round an IRQl3, do you?
2769	2772	All information on third level suspects is classified.
2772	2776	All inquiries through Information Retrieval. That's hopeless, they'll tell you nothing.
2776	2779	Come the time they want something from us, yes.
2779	2781	There's one way I could get round it.
2781	2784	- I could accept my mother's promotion. - Yes.
2786	2787	No!
2788	2790	You can't. You turned it down.
2791	2792	I didn't sign the form.
2793	2795	I did it for you.
2796	2798	- You didn't? - I did.
2799	2801	You didn't!
2801	2802	I did.
2803	2806	- Why did you do that? - That's what you wanted, isn't it?
2808	2809	I don't know.
2810	2812	I don't know what I want.
2813	2816	Come on, before they turn the lights out.
2832	2834	There is one way around it.
2834	2837	I could accept promotion to Information Retrieval.
2876	2877	Sam.
2970	2972	What are you doing?
2972	2974	My God, what's going on?
2974	2976	Emergency procedures.
2977	2979	I haven't got an emergency.
2979	2981	This is an emergency.
2981	2984	Have a nice day. This has not been a recording.
2986	2987	SPOOR: Here. Sign that.
2989	2990	What is it?
2990	2993	It's a 27Bl6. What do you think it is? Where is he?
2994	2996	DOWSER: Spoor, come here. I found it.
2997	2999	Spoor, come here!
2999	3003	Look there, a bypass valve on the transformer.
3015	3017	You've had that scab Tuttle here.
3018	3020	What are you talking about?
3020	3022	Who fixed your ducts?
3023	3025	I told you before, they fixed themselves.
3026	3029	Where did this come from, out of your nostril?
3034	3036	Central Services.
3038	3041	They don't take kindly to sabotage.
3045	3047	This place is in a terrible state.
3048	3051	Just a minute. You're not gonna leave it like this, are you?
3051	3052	Why not?
3052	3056	All you got to do is blow your nose and it's fixed, isn't it?
3093	3096	MRS. BUTTLE: What have you done with his body?
3286	3289	Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure of your company
3290	3292	at her apartment tonight from 8:30
3295	3297	to midnight
3297	3299	To celebrate the completion
3300	3302	of her recent cosmetic
3302	3305	surgery
3323	3325	Thanks.
3325	3326	It's reply paid.
3327	3328	Is it?
3332	3333	Two, three.
3334	3337	Mother, I'm sorry but I am unable to come to your party
3337	3339	You don't have to sing it.
3339	3340	I don't?
3347	3350	Aren't you a bit late? The party started an hour ago.
3350	3353	Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.
3353	3355	Was it all right otherwise?
3364	3368	Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen to get into Information Retrieval.
3368	3371	Mr. Helpmann, I'm dying to get at this woman.
3380	3382	LIVERIED FLUNKY: Where's your invitation?
3382	3384	Don't shoot! Mother!
3386	3389	Sam, I'm so glad you came.
3391	3392	Come in.
3393	3394	Mother?
3396	3398	Oh, God, Mother, is that you?
3399	3401	Of course. Isn't it wonderful?
3402	3404	The bandages came off just this afternoon.
3405	3407	Come on, darling, join in the fun.
3407	3409	Simply everybody's here.
3409	3412	- Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving! - He is.
3412	3415	Mr. Helpmann is here, and he wants to talk to you.
3415	3417	Good. I want to talk to him.
3418	3421	MOTHER: He says you're the first person ever to refuse a promotion.
3421	3425	- He thinks you should see a doctor. - Actually, Mother, I've decided...
3426	3428	Louis, you know Sam.
3428	3430	Can you believe it?
3430	3433	It's just me and my little knife.
3433	3434	Snip.
3434	3436	Slice.
3436	3439	- Can you believe it? - Congratulations.
3439	3441	- But this is just the beginning. - Really?
3442	3444	Of course, yes. You've seen her with her clothes off.
3444	3447	Faces are a doddle compared to tits and ass.
3447	3450	- No hairlines. - Really, Louis!
3452	3454	I've been looking for you everywhere.
3459	3461	Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.
3462	3464	- You stupid sod. - Dear boy...
3465	3467	what do you think of your mother now?
3468	3469	CHAPMAN: It will never last.
3472	3473	Excuse me.
3473	3475	Dr. Chapman, did you say something?
3475	3478	That technique, I've tried it.
3478	3481	A nice effect, but highly unstable.
3482	3485	In six months, she'll look like Grandma Moses.
3485	3487	See here, Chapman.
3487	3491	At least mine don't end up looking like they've been mugged.
3496	3500	What have you done with his body?
3504	3507	- What happened to you? - There's a little complication.
3507	3512	Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine.
3512	3514	Nothing to worry about.
3514	3518	He's promised these bandages will be off in a jiffy.
3518	3521	- Actually, there's someone I want to meet. - I know.
3525	3526	Here we are.
3528	3531	I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
3533	3534	Hello, Shirley.
3536	3538	Come on.
3538	3540	Do you want a drink?
3546	3547	MOTHER: Chase those years away.
3548	3549	Listen, Shirley.
3550	3553	Look, your mother and my mother have the idea that...
3554	3556	Look, I'm very flattered.
3556	3559	And, well, I just don't want you to be under any false impressions.
3559	3561	It's all right.
3561	3563	I don't like you, either.
3566	3567	Sam!
3568	3570	Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.
3571	3573	I'm sorry.
3576	3578	- Do you remember Alison? - Good evening.
3578	3580	Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.
3580	3582	Alison, yes, of course.
3583	3585	- You look different. - I'm two years older.
3586	3589	And she's been to Dr. Jaffe. She doesn't like me telling people.
3589	3591	But, in fact, she's really pleased.
3591	3594	- I knew there was something different. - Remember how they used to stick out?
3594	3596	What?
3596	3598	Yes, well, rather.
3598	3602	- I always used to wonder if they were real. - What, my ears?
3605	3608	- Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back. - Yes, that's...
3609	3611	I always wondered if she wore falsies.
3611	3613	Mr. Helpmann.
3614	3615	False ears.
3616	3619	- Hello, Jack. - You remember my wife, Alison?
3619	3622	Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?
3622	3625	Barbara's very well. How are you?
3625	3626	- Fine, thanks. - Good.
3626	3630	Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here. Have you got a minute?
3631	3632	Would you excuse us?
3633	3636	Of course. Come on, Alison... Barbara.
3638	3639	Sam...
3643	3645	I need your help.
3667	3668	Thanks very much.
3668	3671	Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.
3671	3673	And if I can help you...
3679	3681	Your father and I were very close.
3682	3686	Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me, but we were close friends.
3686	3688	Especially after the bombing.
3689	3693	And now I keep his name alive at the office every day.
3694	3697	It's as though he's there still speaking to me.
3697	3698	"'Ere I am...
3700	3701	"J.H."
3704	3706	The ghost in the machine.
3708	3711	I know he would've wanted me to help you.
3714	3716	And I promised your mother...
3716	3720	that I'd take you onto the team at Information Retrieval.
3720	3723	- But I gather that you... - Well...
3724	3727	actually, Mr. Helpmann, I've changed my mind.
3727	3730	I've decided I'd accept the transfer.
3731	3733	If I'm not too late.
3734	3735	Too late?
3735	3737	That's for me to say.
3738	3740	Well, then I am...
3743	3745	Welcome to Information Retrieval.
3777	3779	My name's Lowry.
3780	3781	Sam Lowry.
3782	3785	I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.
3786	3788	Thirtieth floor, sir.
3788	3789	You're expected.
3793	3796	- Don't you want to search me? - No, sir.
3798	3801	- Want to see my ID? - No need, sir.
3803	3806	- But I could be anybody. - No, you couldn't, sir.
3806	3808	This is Information Retrieval.
3810	3812	The lift's arrived, sir.
3915	3918	WARRENN: Half as terrorists, rest as victims.
3919	3920	Definitely, no.
3920	3923	My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn. Sam Lowry.
3923	3926	Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.
3927	3929	Glad to have you on board.
3931	3933	Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.
3934	3935	Yes.
3935	3938	You'll like it up here.
3938	3941	We've got a crack team of... Are they kidding?...decision makers.
3941	3945	In triplicate. I'm expecting big things... Two copies to Finance!...of you.
3949	3951	Between you and me, Lowry...
3951	3954	this department is about to be upgraded.
3957	3958	Here we are.
3958	3961	Your very own number on your very own door.
3961	3964	And behind that door, your very own office.
3964	3967	Congratulations, DZl015.
3967	3969	Welcome to the team.
3969	3971	Yes. No. Cancel that.
3972	3974	Send two copies to Finance.
4064	4068	You can't borrow any more chairs! There's only one left in here now...
4068	4071	- and I need that to sit on! - What?
4073	4075	Sorry.
4076	4077	Who are you?
4078	4080	My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.
4080	4083	Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.
4084	4087	My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.
4087	4089	Welcome to Expediting.
4089	4092	Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
4093	4095	I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.
4095	4098	You want to take my console into your office?
4099	4101	Yes, just for a few minutes.
4101	4103	I'll tell you what...
4103	4106	you tell me what you want, and I'll do it for you.
4107	4109	I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.
4112	4113	All right.
4115	4118	- I need information on a woman named... - A woman?
4119	4120	- I see. - Yes.
4121	4124	I know her age and distinguishing marks, but I need an address, her place of work.
4125	4127	This your dream girl, is it?
4129	4132	Look, let me use your console.
4132	4134	You must be joking.
4134	4138	When there's a woman involved, there's no stopping me.
4138	4140	Let's have that sheet.
4149	4151	Sod it, it's broken!
4151	4153	But you haven't switched it on.
4154	4155	Oh, yes.
4158	4161	You're putting me off standing there. Go back to your office.
4161	4164	I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
4165	4168	Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.
4169	4170	All right.
4204	4205	Sam!
4228	4229	Sam.
4232	4233	Don't go.
4236	4237	Please.
4249	4250	Well?
4251	4254	- Computers are my forte. - Let me see.
4256	4260	"Gillian Layton. Coloring: White. Hair: Blonde. Eyes: Blue. Height: 5'4".
4260	4262	"Distinguishing scar on left..."
4263	4265	Is this all you've got?
4265	4268	Best to take things slowly where some women are concerned.
4269	4270	Let me see.
4271	4273	Hey, that's mine!
4274	4275	"Layton.
4276	4279	"Truck driver. All inquiries...
4279	4282	"reference officer 412IL. Room 5001."
4285	4287	Lowry, glad I caught you...
4287	4290	Send that back. Settling down? I want this order rescinded.
4290	4294	There's a query about a personnel transporter you took out from the pool.
4294	4297	Or was it a personnel carrier you took?
4297	4301	Send that up to Security. Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.
4301	4304	Get a new suit. You want the lift?
4378	4380	Can I help you?
4386	4389	I'm looking for Officer 412IL.
4389	4391	He won't be very long now.
4394	4396	I thought so.
4402	4403	You may go in now.
4408	4411	TYPIST: Not that one. That one.
4412	4413	Yes.
4420	4422	Excuse me, are you officer 412IL?
4429	4431	Excuse me!
4433	4434	Jack!
4437	4440	I heard you were coming aboard. Congratulations.
4440	4442	- DZl015. - Thanks.
4443	4445	Are you officer 412IL?
4446	4448	That's me. For Sam.
4448	4451	- A very happy Christmas. - Thanks, Jack.
4451	4454	- You're settling in all right? - Yes, fine.
4454	4456	I need some information.
4456	4460	This is Information Retrieval, not Information Dispersal.
4460	4463	Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.
4463	4466	HOLLY: I'm not Amy, I'm Holly. Did I call you Amy, darling? I'm sorry.
4466	4468	- A triplet? - One of them, I think.
4468	4471	Barbara's taken the other two Christmas shopping.
4471	4474	You're not gonna keep calling her Barbara, are you?
4474	4478	Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it? Don't you like it?
4479	4481	Yes, it's fine.
4482	4485	Come on, let's get these together.
4487	4489	I need to find out about a woman.
4489	4492	Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam how we make the word "cat."
4492	4494	- Shall we? - I'm Holly.
4494	4496	Sorry, love. So you are.
4496	4497	This is her.
4499	4501	Layton. Oh, shit.
4504	4506	- How much do you know about this? - Not much.
4506	4509	- What does B58l732 mean to you? - Buttle.
4511	4513	I knew it. You always were bloody quick.
4515	4516	Who else knows?
4516	4518	Warrenn? Helpmann?
4518	4521	I don't know. I only know you got the wrong man.
4521	4523	Information Transit got the wrong man.
4523	4526	I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man.
4527	4530	I accepted him on good faith as the right man.
4530	4531	Was I wrong?
4531	4533	You killed Buttle?
4535	4538	There are rigid parameters laid down to prevent such things happening.
4538	4542	It wasn't my fault that Buttle's heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.
4542	4544	How are you getting on?
4546	4548	- I really need to know about... - Tuttle?
4548	4550	We'll bring Tuttle in...
4550	4554	and interrogate him at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.
4554	4556	And juggle the books in electrical banking.
4556	4560	- What has Tuttle done? - We suspect him of freelance subversion.
4560	4562	Freelance subversive?
4562	4565	Then all I need to wrap up the case is the Layton woman.
4566	4569	- What has she done? - She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.
4569	4572	Since then she's been going around making wild allegations...
4573	4574	trying to exploit the situation.
4574	4578	She's working for someone, and I don't think it's us.
4578	4579	Terrorist?
4582	4584	MYRTLE: Mr. Lint, the next customer has been delivered.
4584	4587	- Thank you, Myrtle. - What're you gonna do about Layton?
4587	4591	I put her on the detention list. Security should have her here before 6:00.
4592	4593	What, here?
4593	4596	So that she can spill the beans inside the department?
4596	4598	Don't do that.
4599	4602	Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'll...
4603	4605	- I'll deactivate her. - What does that mean?
4606	4608	I want nothing unsavory.
4608	4609	Trust me, Jack.
4610	4613	Come on, put these away. Mommy will be back.
4613	4614	Let me have her file.
4616	4618	Trust me, Jack.
4619	4620	All right.
4623	4626	But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.
4628	4630	You sit down there, darling.
4631	4636	- Don't worry, I'll get to her. - You'll never get anywhere in a suit like that.
4637	4638	Here.
4640	4641	Try this.
4642	4644	- Bye-bye. - 'Bye.
4645	4647	But, Jack, I...
4649	4652	Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.
4663	4664	Let him go.
4758	4759	Come on.
4763	4764	Shit!
4778	4779	Oi!
4779	4781	- Come out of there. - What?
4781	4784	That's the Deputy Minister's lift.
4784	4786	Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
4786	4789	Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.
4789	4790	My ID?
4790	4792	Oh, God!
4793	4795	This isn't my suit.
4795	4797	Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.
4798	4800	- Look, really, can't this wait? - No, sir.
4801	4803	I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.
4803	4806	Now, then, what is the date today?
4806	4808	It's the... Oh, God, it'll have to wait!
4808	4810	You, stop!
4841	4842	Stop!
4855	4858	Well done, men. Quick thinking.
4859	4860	Excellent work.
4862	4864	I'll take charge of her now.
4864	4865	Good.
4867	4869	Okay.
4871	4874	It's a classified matter.
4875	4880	I'll include your fine handling of the situation in my report.
4881	4882	Great.
4885	4887	Merry Christmas, Dawson.
4887	4889	Come along with me, please.
4889	4892	Okay, thanks. Well done, men.
4892	4895	Excellent. Good turnout. Very good, thank you.
4915	4917	Just keep moving.
4917	4918	OLD LADY: Hey, stop!
4920	4922	Come back here.
4922	4924	Pick up all these things.
4924	4926	Come on, pick them up.
4927	4928	Disgraceful.
4929	4931	Can't you even...
4931	4933	You illiterate foreign pig!
4933	4936	You come over here from your own filthy country...
4938	4940	and mess up our streets.
4941	4942	God!
4957	4959	Well done! Let's go!
4963	4967	What are you doing? For Christ's sake, keep moving!
4968	4970	Get out of my cab.
4970	4972	What? Just drive!
4974	4977	- You've touched me. Nobody touches me. - What do you...
4978	4981	Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?
4981	4982	Shit. Move over, I'll drive.
4982	4985	Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!
4989	4992	It's okay, Officer. Thank you. I've got everything under control.
4993	4994	Oh, shit!
4995	4999	Listen, please drive. Trust me. You are in terrible danger.
4999	5001	You're an embarrassment.
5001	5003	Please drive. Trust me.
5003	5005	Drive and I'll explain everything.
5005	5008	Please, get out of my cab.
5011	5012	I'm sorry, I...
5012	5016	Okay, you've asked for it. I'm Information Retrieval Officer...
5018	5020	DZl105 and I'm arresting you so...
5021	5024	drive on, or I'll blast your fucking head off!
5026	5027	Go!
5046	5051	Look, I'm sorry about that. I mean, touching you without permission.
5052	5055	Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.
5056	5058	I've been...
5062	5066	You won't believe this. I know it will sound incredible...
5067	5069	but I've been dreaming about you.
5070	5073	No, not like that. I mean, I love you.
5073	5076	I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...
5079	5081	Extraordinary, isn't it?
5084	5085	Anyway...
5091	5093	You don't believe me, do you?
5095	5099	You probably think I'm bonkers, right? Mad, raving.
5101	5104	No! I think you're very attractive.
5106	5107	What?
5108	5111	Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.
5119	5120	Oh, yeah.
5121	5123	Good looking, sexy. Just my type.
5127	5128	I don't believe you.
5129	5130	Why not?
5131	5134	Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.
5136	5137	You're damn right.
5240	5242	You don't trust me, do you?
5276	5280	My God, we shouldn't have come here! I've got a job to do.
5280	5282	But they'll be lying in wait!
5282	5285	Christ, you're paranoid. You got no sense of reality.
5286	5287	Wait!
5291	5295	We should take the lorry and get away! Yeah, where to?
5295	5298	Anywhere. As fast as possible. There isn't anywhere.
5298	5301	Just far away. It's not far enough.
5318	5319	Jill!
5370	5372	What's in the parcel?
5373	5375	A Christmas present.
5383	5384	It's heavy.
5385	5387	Heavy Christmas present.
5387	5389	If you don't trust me, open it.
5389	5392	No, it's fine.
5393	5395	I'd spoil the wrapping.
5395	5400	Anyway, if I want you to trust me, it's only fair that I should trust you.
5407	5411	Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things you do at Information Retrieval?
5413	5416	Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.
5420	5423	How many actual terrorists have you met, Sam?
5426	5428	- Actual terrorists? - Yeah.
5433	5435	It's only my first day.
5447	5449	A roadblock.
5450	5452	- What're we gonna do? - Stay calm.
5452	5455	Don't slow down! Don't stop!
5455	5459	Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!
5460	5463	What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...
5475	5478	We did it! We broke right through them!
5486	5488	Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!
5491	5493	Keep going! Faster!
5494	5497	- Please, get your foot down! - Stay off of me!
5530	5531	Go faster!
5537	5540	What if we lose the house? Don't touch anything!
5541	5543	Don't touch that!
5564	5568	We did it! We did it!
5575	5576	Oh, no!
5590	5593	What would you like for Christmas?
5593	5595	My own credit card.
5605	5608	Why have we come here? Go away.
5608	5611	- Why don't we go back to my flat? - Forget it.
5611	5612	You don't trust me?
5612	5616	Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck, loses me my job...
5616	5619	has every security man in town looking for me? Of course I do.
5619	5621	I was only trying to help. Yeah!
5621	5624	I don't trust you either. What's in that parcel?
5625	5627	You saved it from the lorry. It must be very special.
5627	5631	I saved you from the lorry. You're not very special.
5631	5633	- I'm gonna open it. - Don't touch it.
5643	5644	Sam!
5644	5645	It's me...
5646	5647	and Shirley.
5649	5651	Mrs. Terrain!
5655	5657	That should hold it. Sam?
5657	5659	Hello, Shirley.
5663	5664	What's happened to you now?
5664	5667	My complication had a little complication.
5668	5671	But Dr. Chapman says I'll soon be up...
5671	5674	and bounding about like a young gazelle.
5675	5678	You buying a Christmas present for your mother?
5680	5682	Yes, a little something.
5682	5686	Shirley and I come here regular-larly.
5687	5689	We love romantic lingerie.
5692	5694	Picture me in these.
5700	5701	Oh, my God!
5701	5704	Sam, where are you going?
5715	5716	Jill?
5739	5740	Are you all right?
5743	5745	You don't deserve to be!
5746	5748	What a bloody stupid thing!
5748	5750	How could you? Look at these people!
5750	5751	My God!
5752	5754	It was a bomb!
5754	5758	I should've opened it. I sat there with it next...
5759	5761	There's your bomb, asshole!
5765	5768	A bribe for official monkeys like you.
5772	5774	Make yourself useful.
5780	5782	Here!
5787	5789	Don't touch her! She's hurt.
5792	5794	Don't touch her!
5797	5798	Stop!
5806	5808	Sam, no!
5821	5824	These helmets make your scalp itch.
5824	5827	Don't mention it. And they make you sweat.
5827	5830	Half the time I can never see where I'm going.
5830	5833	It's a great Niagara of perspiration coming down.
5834	5837	I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.
5837	5840	That keeps it up and channels it out to the ears.
5841	5842	Jill!
5842	5843	Who's he?
5843	5846	I don't know, somebody from Information Retrieval.
5846	5848	They're always hanging around in lingerie.
5848	5850	Where is she?
5852	5854	Jill, is that you?
5855	5858	Excuse me, sir. That is government property.
5863	5865	Jill! Answer me!
5867	5869	I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.
5869	5872	She's medium height, green eyes.
5872	5875	I don't know, sir. They check all that at the depot.
5875	5879	We can't allow that. It's more than our job's worth.
5879	5881	Jill, you must be here.
5881	5885	You can fill in an application form if you're a relative.
5885	5887	Now do stop, sir, please.
5894	5896	Sorry about that, sir.
5896	5898	Regulations.
5904	5906	WARRENN: This is a black eye for the department, Lowry.
5906	5908	I don't care how you behaved at Records.
5908	5911	Informational Retrieval is an executive branch.
5911	5914	We're proud of our reputation and we protect it.
5914	5918	That convoy of personnel carriers is still not accounted for!
5918	5921	I thought I told you to deal with it. And what is this mess?
5921	5924	An empty desk is an efficient desk! Good God!
5924	5927	Queries from Security. Searches from Central Banking about a check.
5927	5931	Clarification notices from Accounting about unreturned receipts!
5931	5933	- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out... - Shut up!
5934	5937	I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.
5937	5942	But don't think you can intimidate us with your friends in high places!
5942	5944	Now shape up!
5948	5951	Lime, I have to use your computer.
5951	5953	Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
5953	5957	You seem to have rather a lot to get on with yourself.
5964	5965	Shit!
5965	5967	Come off it, Jack.
5967	5970	Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
5970	5974	Sorry, Sam, this case has become more complicated since last we talked.
5975	5978	But she's innocent, Jack. She's done nothing wrong.
5978	5981	Tell that to the wives of the men she blew up this afternoon.
5981	5983	She's not alone in all this.
5983	5985	We just had a report in that Tuttle...
5985	5989	has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.
5989	5991	As a matter of fact, it looks like in your block.
5992	5995	I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.
5996	5999	But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle and the girl are in league, do you?
6000	6003	I do. Everything's connected. All along the line.
6003	6005	Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.
6005	6009	Our job is to trace the connections and then reveal them.
6011	6015	This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside.
6015	6016	But, Jack...
6017	6019	She's innocent, Jack.
6021	6024	- We've always been close, haven't we? - Yes, Jack.
6024	6028	Until this all blows over, just stay away from me.
6155	6156	It's you!
6157	6159	What's happening?
6160	6163	Your thermostat's gone, and then some.
6164	6166	What happened to my flat?
6166	6167	Hello? What?
6168	6170	It's for you, but...
6170	6172	as you don't live here anymore.
6172	6173	- What? - Absolutely.
6173	6175	SPOOR: Do you know what this is?
6175	6178	This is an H2206...
6178	6182	authorizing the compulsory, temporary requisitioning of this flat...
6182	6184	for our necessary repairs.
6188	6190	Don't forget your receipt!
6192	6196	I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.
6199	6200	Bastards!
6213	6215	What are you doing?
6260	6263	It's getting cold in here.
6265	6266	Oh, God!
6267	6268	SPOOR: It smells badly.
6269	6272	It's shit! We're filling up with shit!
6287	6288	Oh, shit.
6291	6293	We're all in it together, kid.
6305	6307	Jill!
6310	6311	Oh, God.
6311	6313	Are you all right?
6314	6317	- What happened to you after... - Your face. Are you hurt?
6319	6321	No, I'm fine.
6324	6327	I've been worried sick about you.
6339	6342	- Who was that? - That's a friend of mine.
6344	6345	Oh, God! Holy shit!
6346	6349	We better get out of here, quick. Come on.
6353	6355	Thank God! Here, take it.
6357	6359	It's not so big.
6409	6410	Are you sure this is all right?
6411	6412	Yes, certain.
6413	6416	My mother's away for Christmas.
6417	6420	She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.
6422	6425	The wraps come off tomorrow.
6463	6467	Lock the door after me. Don't answer the phone to anyone.
6468	6469	I won't be long.
6471	6473	Where're you going? I know a way to save you.
6473	6475	Trust me. I can do it.
6475	6477	You can't go without me!
6511	6514	Excuse me, Dawson, could you put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?
6514	6518	I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
6518	6521	And you can't tell me what the proper channels are...
6521	6524	because that's classified information.
6524	6529	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest.
6530	6531	Thank you, Dawson.
6538	6541	Goodnight, Mr. Lime. Goodnight, Dawson.
6570	6574	No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!
6574	6578	It's your breathing. Take a deep breath after "Noel."
6578	6580	Ready, one, two, three.
6591	6594	"'Ere I am, J.H."
6595	6597	The ghost in the machine.
6623	6624	Mr. Helpmann?
6661	6662	Mr. Helpmann?
6742	6743	Jill.
6793	6794	Who's there?
6803	6804	What do you think?
6805	6806	Is it me?
6813	6814	What?
6819	6821	You don't exist anymore.
6822	6824	I've killed you.
6828	6830	Jill Layton is dead.
6839	6841	Care for a little necrophilia?
6902	6904	Merry Christmas.
6917	6919	Something for an executive?
6936	6938	She's dead.
6938	6940	This is a friend of mine.
6943	6944	No!
6945	6946	Sam!
6953	6956	93IHKSl608, you are charged with the following:
6956	6959	"Giving aid and comfort to the enemies of society.
6959	6961	"Attempting to conceal a fugitive from justice.
6961	6964	"Passing confidential documents to unauthorized personnel.
6964	6967	"Destroying government property, viz. Several personnel carriers.
6968	6970	"Taking possession under false pretences of said carriers.
6970	6973	"Forging the signature of the Head of Records.
6973	6976	"Misdirecting funds in the form of a check to A. Buttle...
6976	6978	"through unauthorized channels.
6978	6980	"Tampering with Central Services' supply ducts.
6981	6983	"Obstructing forces of law and order.
6983	6985	"Disgracing the good name of the government...
6985	6988	"and the Department of Information Retrieval.
6988	6991	"Disrupting the Ministry's internal communicating system.
6992	6994	"Wasting Ministry time and paper."
6995	6999	Now, either you can plead guilty to seven or eight of the charges...
6999	7002	which will help keep costs down within your means...
7002	7006	or borrow a sum to be negotiated from us at a very competitive rate.
7006	7010	We can offer you something at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years...
7010	7013	but you will have to buy insurance to qualify for this scheme.
7013	7015	If you prefer something more specific...
7015	7018	say, against electrical charges over £70...
7018	7021	All you're requested to do now is sign this form.
7021	7023	Think carefully before you sign.
7023	7026	Thinking ahead in financial matters is always a wise course.
7026	7027	FORCES OF DARKNESS: Plead guilty.
7027	7029	It's cheaper.
7033	7036	Sam, what are we going to do with you?
7039	7040	Where's Jill?
7042	7044	I've got to find her.
7045	7047	Please, you've got to get me out of here.
7048	7051	I understand, Sam. I know exactly how you feel...
7052	7054	so I brought you a bottle of barley water.
7055	7057	Please help me.
7057	7060	I assure you, I'm doing everything within my power.
7060	7063	But the rules of the game are laid down.
7064	7067	We all have to play by them. Even me.
7068	7071	It's all a mistake. You've got to understand that.
7072	7077	From the Department's point of view, there was certainly a bit of an own goal.
7077	7079	I'm not a terrorist.
7079	7082	You know that. Please get me out of here!
7082	7085	Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.
7086	7089	You're running up an enormous bill by not cooperating.
7091	7093	Please, Mr. Helpmann...
7094	7095	help me find Jill.
7101	7103	Sam, I think I ought to tell you.
7104	7108	I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
7110	7112	Thrown in the towel.
7113	7115	Dead?
7116	7117	Yes.
7118	7122	It's all a bit confusing, but it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
7127	7129	No, it's all right. I did that.
7132	7135	The odd thing is it appears to have happened twice.
7135	7138	A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.
7140	7141	Twice?
7142	7146	There you are. All I can say is don't fall at the last fence.
7147	7150	The finish is in sight. See you in the paddock.
7150	7153	Do cooperate. Think of your mother.
7153	7155	Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.
7155	7158	Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.
7167	7168	No!
7186	7189	Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.
7191	7195	If you hold out too long, you could jeopardize your credit rating.
7243	7244	Jack?
7253	7254	Shut up!
7257	7259	Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.
7260	7261	Bastard!
7263	7266	Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.
7266	7268	Take that mask off.
7273	7275	You stupid bastard!
7277	7278	How could you do this to me?
7279	7280	Jack, I'm frightened.
7280	7282	How do you think I feel? You shit!
7283	7284	Jack... Shut up!
7289	7292	This is a professional relationship.
7297	7298	You can't!
7300	7302	No, Jack, please!
7349	7351	You okay?
7351	7352	Tuttle!
7353	7354	Call me Harry.
7400	7401	LIBERATOR: Let's go!
7699	7702	Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.
7703	7704	Right this way.
7710	7711	It's a sad loss.
7712	7714	Your mother was with her at the end.
7718	7722	Mrs. Terrain has just received that most wonderful of gifts.
7723	7725	She came to us physically new.
7726	7729	She goes hence from us not so physically new.
7729	7732	But the spirit never grows old.
7733	7735	Madam Lowry!
7739	7740	Mother!
7742	7743	Sam!
7745	7746	Mother?
7748	7749	Stop calling me that.
7752	7754	Mother, please!
7755	7757	Is this guy bothering you?
7758	7759	Mother!
7761	7764	Go away. This is a very sacred moment.
7946	7948	He's got away from us, Jack.
7948	7951	I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann. He's gone.
7991	7995	Tomorrow was another day
7996	8000	The morning found me miles away
8001	8005	With still a million things to say
8008	8011	Now
8011	8015	As twilight beams the sky above
8016	8020	Recalling thrills of our love
8022	8026	There's one thing I'm certain of
8026	8031	Return I will
8033	8038	To old Brazil
