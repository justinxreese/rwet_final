54	56	This is Media-Break.
56	59	You give us three minutes and we'll give you the world.
60	62	Good morning, I'm Casey Wong with Jess Perkins.
63	64	Top story, Pretoria.
65	68	The threat of nuclear confrontation in South Africa escalated today...
69	72	...when the military government of that besieged city-state...
72	75	...unveiled a French-made neutron bomb...
75	80	...and affirmed that it would use it as the city's last line of defense.
81	86	The president's first press conference from the Star Wars Peace Platform...
86	89	...got off to a shaky start when power failed...
89	94	...causing a period of weightlessness for the president and his staff.
94	97	We'll be back in a moment.
97	99	Is it time for that operation?
100	103	This may be the most important decision of your life.
103	106	So come down and talk to one of our qualified surgeons...
107	108	...at the Family Heart Center.
110	114	We feature the complete line of hearts by Jensen and Yamaha.
115	116	You pick the heart.
116	119	Extended warranties. Financing.
119	121	Qualifies for health tax credit.
123	126	And remember, we care.
127	130	Three dead police officers, one critically injured.
130	133	Police leaders blame Omni Consumer Products, OCP...
134	138	...the firm which recently agreed with the city to fund and run...
138	140	...the Detroit Metro Police Department.
141	143	Dick Jones, president of OCP.
143	147	Every policeman knows there are inherent risks in his job.
148	151	If you can't stand the heat, you better stay out of the kitchen.
152	157	Although wounded, Officer Frederickson escaped and identified this man.
157	161	Clarence Boddicker, unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit...
161	165	...sought in connection with the deaths of 31 officers.
165	169	Today he is free while doctors at Henry Ford Hospital...
169	172	...fight to save Officer Frank Frederickson.
172	173	Good luck, Frank.
183	186	Attempted murder? It's not like he killed someone.
186	188	This violates my client's civil rights.
189	192	Make it assault and I can make bail in cash, now.
192	196	Listen, your client's a scumbag, you're a scumbag...
196	198	...and scumbags see the judge.
199	203	Now get out of my police station and take Laughing Boy with you.
211	212	Hi.
213	215	Murphy, transferring in from Metro South.
216	218	Nice precinct.
218	219	Yeah, pretty good.
220	222	You work for a living down here.
222	224	Get your armor and suit up.
231	233	- No, you can't get a cup of coffee. - Oh, sarge.
234	237	- Stark, any word on Frederickson? - Still listed as critical.
238	240	His wife must be going crazy.
240	241	- Murphy? - Yeah, that's me.
241	242	- Manson. - Hi.
242	244	What brings you to paradise?
244	247	I think the OCP's moving a lot of new guys here.
247	252	Omni Consumer Products. What a bunch of morons.
252	256	They're gonna manage this department right into the ground.
256	258	- Where you from? - Metro South.
258	259	Welcome to hell.
259	260	- Murphy? - Yo.
261	265	- Cut 10 guys loose on the east side. - Try to get up when you're in a jam.
265	268	Try to get a Medevac after you been jammed.
268	272	I'll tell you what we should do. We should strike.
285	286	The funeral is tomorrow.
288	292	Department requests all officers not on duty to attend.
292	297	Any donations for the family may be given to Cecil as usual.
300	303	I don't want to hear any more talk about strike.
303	306	We're not plumbers, we're police officers.
307	309	And police officers don't strike.
313	316	Murphy. Front and center.
333	336	Ooh, tiger!
352	357	Lewis, come here when you're finished fucking around with your suspect.
362	364	This guy's gonna be your new partner.
364	367	Murphy, meet Lewis. Show him the neighborhood.
367	369	Glad to know you, Murphy.
369	370	Pretty neat.
373	376	I better drive until you know your way around.
377	380	I usually drive when I'm breaking in a new partner.
401	404	You really think the old man will be there?
404	406	Why invite us?
406	410	All the division heads are bringing their support teams. It's big.
410	412	They're green lighting Delta City.
412	415	No way. They never move ahead of schedule.
415	419	Jones has the 209 series ready and wants to show off.
419	422	- Tough break, Bob. - What?
422	426	When ED 209 ran into serious delays...
426	428	...the old man ordered a backup plan.
428	430	95th floor, have a nice day.
430	433	Probably to light a fire under Jones' ass.
433	436	- Yeah. - Old Bob here gets the assignment.
437	439	Nobody in Security Concepts takes it seriously.
440	443	Fucking Jones, I'd go straight to the old man if I could.
443	445	Don't mess with Jones.
445	448	Be careful, man. I hear Jones is a real shark.
448	450	- Who asked you, twerp? - Bob.
450	452	What's the problem with the police?
452	456	Their union's been bitching ever since we took over. The usual stuff.
457	459	But we'll turn things around.
459	462	Good. Very good. Let's get started.
468	469	My friends.
471	476	I've had this dream for more than a decade now.
476	480	A dream which I've invited you all to share with me.
481	485	In six months we begin construction...
485	487	...of Delta City.
488	490	Where Old Detroit now stands.
494	496	Old Detroit has a cancer.
497	498	The cancer is crime.
499	501	It must be cut out before we employ the 2 million...
501	504	...workers to breathe life back into the city.
504	505	Yes.
509	514	Shifts in tax structure have made the economy ideal for corporate growth.
515	518	But community services, in this case law enforcement...
518	520	...have suffered.
521	526	I think it's time we gave something back.
539	542	Take a close look at the track record of this company.
543	545	You'll see that we've gambled...
546	548	...in markets usually regarded as nonprofit.
549	553	Hospitals. Prisons. Space exploration.
554	557	I say, good business is where you find it.
559	564	As you know, we now have a contract to run local law enforcement.
565	567	But at Security Concepts...
567	572	...we believe an efficient police force is only part of the solution.
572	575	No, we need something more.
575	578	We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.
578	581	A cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep.
581	586	A cop with superior firepower and the reflexes to use it.
587	589	Fellow executives...
589	593	...it's a pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement.
598	600	ED 209.
636	639	The Enforcement Droid series 209...
639	641	...is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.
642	646	209 is programmed for urban pacification, but that's just a start.
647	649	After a successful tour in Old Detroit...
649	655	...we can expect 209 to become the hot military product for the next decade.
655	657	- Dr. McNamara. - We'll need a subject.
658	659	- Mr. Kinney. - Yes, sir.
659	661	- Will you give us a hand? - Yes, sir.
661	666	Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a typical arrest and disarming procedure.
667	670	Mr. Kinney, use your gun in a threatening manner.
672	674	- Point it at ED 209. - Yes, sir.
683	685	Please put down your weapon.
685	688	You have 20 seconds to comply.
689	692	I think you better do what he says.
697	699	You now have 15 seconds to comply.
701	706	You are in direct violation of penal code 113, section 9.
706	709	- You have five seconds to comply. - Help me!
709	713	- Four, three, two, one. - Help me! Help!
713	717	I am now authorized to use physical force.
738	740	Somebody want to call a paramedic?
740	743	- Let's go, Johnson. - You pull the plug on this thing?
744	747	All right, don't touch him.
747	749	- Don't touch him! - He didn't hear the gun drop.
750	751	He didn't hear it?!
753	756	Dick, I'm very disappointed.
758	761	It's only a glitch. A temporary setback.
761	762	You call this a glitch?
764	766	We're to begin construction in six months.
767	771	This setback could cost us millions in interest costs alone.
771	772	Not necessarily, sir.
773	774	There's a Robocop program...
775	778	...I developed as a contingency against just this sort of thing.
778	780	Thank you for your concern.
780	784	- This is something we could... - Wait a minute. Dick!
786	789	Maybe what we need here is a fresh perspective.
790	792	Tell me about your plan. How long will it take?
793	797	We've restructured the police department with some good candidates.
797	800	We can go to prototype within 90 days.
800	801	Very good.
801	805	Get your staff together. I'll expect a presentation in 20 minutes.
806	808	Thank you, sir.
814	818	That's how it is in the big leagues. You see an opening, you go for it.
820	822	Watch your back, Jones will be looking for you.
823	827	Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball and I was there to pick it up.
827	829	Too bad about Kinney, huh?
830	832	That's life in the big city.
833	834	When do we start?
835	837	As soon as some schmuck volunteers.
854	856	Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.
857	860	My son watches this cop show, TJ Lazer.
860	863	Lazer does this whenever he kills a bad guy.
863	867	- My kid thinks every good cop... - You don't want to disappoint him.
868	873	Yeah, well, role models can be very important to a boy.
879	881	Okay, I get a kick out of it.
881	883	All units, sector nine...
883	885	Well, that's...
886	887	Why don't you drive?
894	895	Shit!
896	899	- I don't believe it! - What?
899	901	You burnt the fucking money!
901	903	I had to blow the door!
903	905	It's as good as marked, asshole.
905	908	You stupid, stupid asshole!
908	911	- Clarence! - What do you want?!
911	913	We got a cop on our tail.
920	922	- Come on, speed it up. - Move it!
922	925	- We ain't gonna outrun a cop. - Slow down.
925	928	- Are you crazy? - Shut the fuck up and do it!
928	929	Just do it!
929	934	This is 154. We're in pursuit of suspect. Request backup.
934	937	- Roger, 154. Backup unavailable. - Give me your piece.
939	941	Backup ETA, 15 minutes.
941	943	Bobby, get the door!
943	946	- Everybody load up! - Let's go, come on.
946	949	- Okay. - All right, here we go.
958	960	- What the fuck? - Where'd he go?
960	961	Emil!
961	962	He's up here!
978	979	Get him!
987	989	Shit, Clarence, my leg.
989	991	Leon, pick him up.
991	993	- Ready? - Nope, hang on.
994	995	Bobby.
997	999	- Can you fly, Bobby? - Clarence, no!
999	1001	Hit it!
1026	1031	This is 154. We've located that van in sector 3D. Where's backup?
1031	1036	Backup unavailable. Estimate 20 minutes before units can arrive.
1038	1040	Well, you call it.
1041	1043	- Let's's do it. - Okay.
1050	1051	Go.
1052	1053	Stay in touch.
1096	1097	Freeze.
1099	1102	Okay, let's see those hands.
1102	1103	Nice and easy.
1104	1106	Sure.
1106	1109	Mind if I zip this up?
1128	1131	We rob banks, but never get to keep the money.
1131	1136	We steal money to buy coke, then sell the coke to make more money.
1136	1140	- Capital investment, man. - Why bother? We could just steal it.
1140	1143	No better way to steal than free enterprise.
1143	1144	Smoke?
1144	1146	No, those things will kill you.
1148	1150	You want to live forever?
1163	1165	Don't move.
1169	1171	Go ahead and do it.
1172	1174	Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
1181	1182	Lewis?
1182	1183	Lewis!
1185	1187	I got a situation in here.
1187	1190	Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!
1190	1192	Turn around and spread your legs. That's right.
1193	1196	Lewis, where are you? You all right?
1198	1199	Hands on your head.
1199	1201	Lewis.
1205	1207	Let us take over from here, Emil.
1226	1227	Your ass is mine.
1227	1229	No!
1230	1232	Not yet, it ain't.
1244	1246	Well, what have we here?
1248	1251	You a good cop, hotshot?
1253	1255	Sure you are.
1255	1258	You gotta be some kind of great cop.
1259	1262	Come in here all by yourself.
1266	1267	Where's your partner?
1267	1269	Where's your partner?
1269	1272	Guys, the other one was upstairs.
1272	1274	She was sweet.
1276	1277	I took her out.
1282	1285	I bet that really pisses you off.
1290	1293	You probably don't think I'm a very nice guy.
1293	1294	Do you?
1295	1296	I think you're slime.
1301	1303	See, I got this problem.
1304	1306	Cops don't like me.
1306	1309	So I don't like cops.
1325	1326	Well, give the man a hand.
1331	1332	He's all yours.
1345	1347	- Look out. - Turn around, man.
1347	1350	Hey, pretty boy. Hey, over here.
1367	1368	I'm out of ammo.
1368	1370	Me too.
1370	1372	Does it hurt? Does it hurt?
1379	1381	Okay, fun's over.
1385	1387	Okay, let's get out of here.
1389	1391	Good night, sweet prince.
1393	1395	Hey, wait up. Wait up.
1418	1419	Murphy.
1434	1435	- Get him over. - Clear.
1437	1440	Ventilate him. Get the mask.
1453	1454	Okay, hit the door.
1458	1460	- Let me get pressure. - Mask him.
1462	1464	Got a pressure of 60 pel.
1464	1466	We're gonna have to intubate this guy.
1471	1474	All right, I got it in. Breath sounds?
1474	1476	- You're in. - Other side.
1477	1480	- Let's get the mask trousers up. - Get the clothes off.
1480	1483	Clothes off. Prep him for a central line.
1483	1487	Let's get some blood drawn. Type and crossing, six units.
1492	1493	Pressure's dropping.
1493	1496	Central line's in, getting pressure back. Normal saline.
1497	1498	Can you do that, Dad?
1502	1504	- I really have to tell you something. - Blood pressure?
1505	1506	- I've got 40 pel. - All right.
1514	1517	Coarse D-fib. Okay, we gotta shock him.
1521	1524	Put the Foley in. Let's blow the mask trousers.
1524	1526	- Okay. - Stand clear.
1529	1532	Coarse D-fib. Let's shock him again.
1532	1533	Clear.
1536	1539	Flat line. Let's go, intracardiac epinephrine.
1544	1546	- All right, it's in. - No pulse.
1546	1549	Let's go ahead and shock a flat line and then quit.
1550	1552	- Okay, everybody stand clear. - Clear.
1559	1562	All right, that's all we can do. Let's call it.
1562	1563	What's the time?
1564	1566	6:15.
1581	1583	Sharp.
1584	1585	It's starting to roll.
1588	1588	Shit!
1595	1597	Bring in the L.E.D.
1597	1598	Lock it down.
1606	1608	- He's on. - What's the story?
1608	1610	- We saved the left arm. - What?
1610	1614	We agreed on total body prosthesis. Now lose the arm.
1614	1616	Jesus, Morton.
1617	1621	- Can he understand? - We'll blank his memory, anyway.
1621	1623	We should lose the arm. What do you think?
1624	1627	He signed a release when he joined the force. And he's dead.
1627	1630	We can do pretty much what we want.
1631	1633	Lose the arm.
1633	1636	Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.
1640	1642	The outer skin will be like this.
1643	1645	It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.
1645	1647	Go ahead, shake his hand.
1649	1651	Come here often? How you doing?
1655	1657	Got a hell of a grip.
1657	1659	It's 400 foot-pounds.
1659	1661	He could crush every bone in your hand.
1661	1663	All right, attach it to his shoulder.
1664	1665	I like that.
1671	1674	You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!
1680	1684	Hey, hey. Look, he's watching us!
1690	1692	This is for you.
1695	1696	Happy New Year.
1702	1704	We get the best of both worlds.
1704	1706	The fastest reflexes possible today...
1706	1708	...computer-assisted memory...
1708	1711	...and a lifetime of on-the-street officer programming.
1712	1715	It is my great pleasure to present to you...
1717	1718	...Robocop.
1722	1724	Come on, come on.
1724	1726	That's for you.
1726	1727	- That's for you. - Go, Robo.
1746	1748	I'm what you call a repeat offender.
1748	1750	I will offend again.
1751	1753	I get my orders from a higher source.
1753	1755	Shut up, asshole.
1760	1763	- Go through the side. - A cell is set for observation.
1763	1765	What's this all about?
1765	1767	- Who's this? - Sergeant John Reed.
1767	1771	It's official OCP business, so please, get lost.
1771	1775	- We got four or five days... - Hey, this is bullshit!
1775	1777	I take my orders from...
1793	1796	What is this shit?
1817	1819	When at rest, you'll sit in a chair.
1819	1821	Yes, I understand.
1821	1822	What about tracking?
1822	1825	We check his exact location with one of these.
1827	1828	How does he eat?
1828	1830	His digestive system is simple.
1831	1835	This processor dispenses a paste that sustains his organic systems.
1843	1845	It tastes like baby food.
1847	1848	Knock yourself out.
1859	1861	- Let's start with tracking. - Give me a grid.
1861	1863	- Got it? - Clear.
1863	1865	- Target. - Check.
1865	1866	- Target. - Check.
1866	1868	Now follow.
1871	1872	Check.
1872	1874	Voice stress analyzer.
1874	1876	- It's up. - One, two...
1877	1878	...three.
1878	1880	- Check. - Record.
1880	1882	- Now playback. - Bring it up 50%.
1883	1884	Full frame.
1885	1886	I think he's ready.
1886	1888	- We got it. - All right, clear out.
1890	1891	What are your prime directives?
1892	1894	Serve the public trust.
1894	1896	Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.
1900	1901	That's good.
1902	1903	That's very good.
1912	1913	I fucking love that guy.
1951	1955	- It's Supercop. - Look at that fucking gun.
1971	1972	Shit!
1973	1975	- This guy is good. - He's not a guy, he's a machine.
1976	1978	What are they gonna do? Replace us?
1985	1986	Come on.
1992	1993	- Reed. - Yeah.
1993	1995	He needs a car.
1996	1997	Thank you.
1999	2000	Sure.
2000	2001	Anytime.
2001	2004	Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.
2038	2040	I'd buy that for a dollar.
2045	2048	And guess what I'm going to do now?
2052	2054	Happy birthday, Bixby.
2054	2055	Is there anything else, sir?
2056	2058	Empty the register and put the money in the bag.
2058	2060	Excuse me?
2060	2063	I said, give me your money, all of it, and don't fuck with me!
2064	2065	Now move!
2066	2067	Open the safe, pops.
2068	2070	Open the goddamn safe!
2070	2072	- We don't have a safe. - Shit.
2072	2076	There's your goddamned safe! Now open the son of a bitch.
2076	2079	Quit stalling. You better open that son of a bitch!
2079	2080	Come on!
2081	2083	I'm gonna blow her brains out.
2084	2087	- I'll open the safe. - Good boy.
2089	2093	You better open that on the count of three. One, two...
2096	2098	Fuck me.
2098	2100	Drop the gun. You are under arrest.
2101	2105	Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!
2123	2126	Thank you for your cooperation. Good night.
2127	2130	I'll buy that for a dollar!
2143	2144	No, please!
2147	2148	Don't touch me!
2148	2152	- Get away! Get away! - We don't want your money!
2155	2157	Take it easy. We don't want to hurt you.
2158	2159	Too much hair.
2159	2162	I know! We'll give her a haircut.
2165	2166	- Hey, hey! - What?
2166	2169	There's more hair down there!
2173	2174	No! Don't!
2177	2178	Please.
2185	2187	Let the woman go. You are under arrest.
2188	2189	Shit.
2190	2193	You better back up, pal, because he's gonna do her!
2193	2195	He's gonna kill her!
2200	2201	He's gonna kill her!
2210	2212	Your move, creep.
2212	2214	No problem. It's okay.
2219	2220	Thank God.
2220	2223	I was so scared. Thank you.
2224	2225	Thank you.
2226	2229	Madam, you have suffered an emotional shock.
2229	2232	I will notify a rape crisis center.
2244	2246	All units, sector six. Please close intersections...
2253	2256	I don't care. Get those men by the stairs, now.
2259	2262	Terrorism has never been a factor in city politics before.
2263	2265	That changed today when former councilman...
2265	2267	...Ron Miller entered City Hall with a gun.
2267	2269	He's on the second floor...
2269	2271	...holding Mayor Gibson and his staff hostage.
2271	2275	We do believe that Miller has killed one of the hostages.
2276	2280	- Lieutenant, what's next? - We wait. Terrorism is very tricky.
2280	2284	Massive and immediate retaliation is the best policy. Unfortunately...
2284	2287	- Excuse us. - Wait, where you going?
2289	2291	Statement, please.
2295	2299	Hey, let's have some crowd control. Come on, get these people back!
2299	2302	- Where the hell are you going? - Keep him talking.
2303	2304	One quick question here!
2307	2308	Who made you?
2308	2310	Are you invincible?
2314	2316	Okay, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.
2316	2318	We'll give you whatever you want.
2318	2320	First, don't fuck with me.
2321	2322	I'm a desperate man.
2323	2326	And second, I want some fresh coffee.
2327	2328	And third, I want a recount.
2329	2331	No matter how it turns out, I want my old job back.
2332	2334	- Okay. - And I want a bigger office.
2336	2340	And I want a new car! And I want the city to pay for it all!
2340	2344	- What kind of car, Miller? - One with reclining leather seats...
2344	2347	...that goes really fast and gets really shitty gas mileage.
2347	2350	How about the 6000 SUX?
2351	2352	Yeah.
2352	2354	Okay, sure.
2355	2358	What about cruise control? Does it have cruise control?
2358	2360	No problem, Miller.
2360	2363	Let the mayor go, we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.
2365	2367	Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!
2367	2370	When people jerk me off, I kill them!
2370	2372	You want to see?
2377	2378	Get up, Your Honor. Get up!
2378	2381	Get up. Your public wants to see you.
2383	2385	Nobody ever takes me seriously!
2386	2387	We'll get serious now...
2387	2390	...and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye!
2401	2404	Robocop. Who is he? What is he?
2404	2406	Where does he come from?
2406	2408	He is OCP's newest soldier...
2408	2411	...in their revolutionary crime management program.
2411	2413	OCP spokesmen claim the fearless machine...
2413	2415	...has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.
2415	2419	Today, kids at Lee lacocca Elementary got to meet in person...
2419	2422	...what their parents only read about in comic books.
2422	2423	Excuse me, Robo...
2424	2427	...any special message for all the kids watching at home?
2428	2430	Stay out of trouble.
2431	2433	More fighting in the Mexican crisis...
2434	2437	...when American troops joined in a raid with Mexican Nationals...
2437	2440	...against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.
2441	2442	Now this.
2442	2444	Red alert. Red alert.
2446	2448	You crossed my line of death.
2448	2450	You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.
2451	2452	Pakistan is threatening my border!
2453	2455	That's it, buster. No more military aid.
2458	2459	Nukem.
2460	2461	Get them before they get you.
2461	2465	Another quality home game from Butler Brothers.
2465	2469	Today labor leaders agreed to sanction construction of OCP's Delta City...
2470	2473	...thereby creating one million much-needed new jobs...
2473	2477	...despite questions about worker safety in dangerous Old Detroit.
2477	2480	Robert Morton, vice president, Security Concepts, OCP.
2481	2484	I can't comment on Delta City. But I will tell you this:
2485	2490	Security Concepts projects the end of crime in Old Detroit within 40 days.
2490	2494	There's a new guy in town. His name's Robocop.
2496	2500	Hey, hey, hey, Bobby-boy. Vice president. Congratulations.
2500	2503	- Handball Tuesday night? - I would, Bill...
2503	2505	...but I've got some models coming to my place.
2506	2508	I'd buy that for a dollar.
2512	2513	Welcome to the club, Bob.
2517	2521	You're making a name for yourself in Security Concepts with Robocop.
2521	2522	I try.
2523	2525	Let me in on the bottom line, pal.
2525	2527	I hear Jones was plenty pissed.
2527	2531	You know, he's got this killer rep, but it's a smoke screen.
2532	2535	He's lost his teeth. The guy's a pussy.
2535	2537	Are we talking about the same Dick Jones?
2537	2541	He's old, we're young. That's life.
2553	2554	I gotta go. I got a meeting.
2565	2567	Congratulations, Bob.
2568	2569	Thanks.
2570	2573	I remember when I was a young executive at this company.
2574	2576	We used to call the old man funny names.
2577	2578	"Iron Butt."
2579	2580	"Boner."
2581	2583	Once I even called him...
2584	2585	..."asshole."
2591	2593	But there was always respect.
2593	2596	I always knew where the line was drawn.
2598	2601	And you just stepped over it, buddy-boy.
2602	2604	You've insulted me.
2605	2608	And you've insulted this company with your bastard creation.
2608	2611	I had a guaranteed military sale with ED 209.
2611	2613	Renovation program.
2613	2615	Spare parts for 25 years.
2615	2618	Who cares if it worked or not?
2619	2622	The old man thought it was pretty important, Dick.
2631	2632	You know...
2633	2635	...he's a sweet old man.
2638	2640	And he means well.
2641	2643	But he's not gonna live forever.
2646	2648	And I'm number two around here.
2649	2652	Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?
2654	2656	You just...
2657	2660	...fucked with the wrong guy.
2660	2662	You're out of your fucking mind.
2667	2669	You better pray...
2670	2673	...that that unholy monster of yours doesn't screw up.
2693	2694	You hungry?
2694	2696	No, thanks.
2737	2739	Oh, no.
2744	2747	Damn rebels blew up the airport in Acapulco.
2747	2750	Great, we were going there next week. Hey, what was that?
2756	2757	Hey, look.
2758	2760	Bucket-boy's online.
2775	2776	Hey. Hey!
2777	2778	Halt. Stop!
2778	2779	Wait a minute!
2780	2783	- What's going on? - I don't know. He just left.
2783	2784	He just left?
2786	2787	Roosevelt!
2789	2790	We got a problem.
2793	2794	Out of the way.
2795	2796	Take a look at this.
2800	2802	Shit! Call Bob Morton.
2812	2814	Jerry, book him. I'll catch up with you later.
2820	2821	Hello.
2821	2824	I haven't really had a chance to introduce myself.
2824	2826	I'm Anne Lewis.
2827	2829	Do you have a name?
2835	2838	How can I help you, Officer Lewis?
2839	2842	That's not really what I meant.
2842	2843	Don't you have a name?
2843	2845	Hold it. Sign right here.
2845	2847	You don't understand. I'm OCP.
2848	2850	Murphy.
2850	2851	It's you.
2856	2858	You really don't remember me?
2859	2860	Excuse me.
2860	2862	I have to go.
2862	2865	Somewhere, there is a crime happening.
2865	2866	Stop!
2867	2870	- What did you talk to him about? - Nothing.
2870	2872	- Shit. - Shit.
2875	2876	Stop!
2876	2879	Hey, you there! Stop!
2884	2886	You're in a lot of trouble, officer.
2887	2888	Come on.
2889	2892	I was assured full cooperation by this precinct.
2892	2895	One of your grunts screws it up, I'll have your job!
2895	2897	- What's the update? - Hard to know.
2897	2900	- We have a glitch or what? - He wasn't designed for somatic rest.
2901	2902	He had a dream. A dream.
2903	2905	This cop questioned him.
2905	2908	I didn't question him. I asked his name. He didn't know.
2908	2909	Oh, great.
2910	2914	Let me make it clear. He doesn't have a name, he has a program.
2914	2915	He's product.
2915	2917	- Is that clear? - Sure.
2918	2920	Pull him in. Run a systems check, the works.
2920	2923	Take him offline because he had a dream?
2923	2924	What, are you kidding?
2925	2926	Let's get out of here.
2927	2928	Listen, Reed.
2928	2930	Try to keep one thing in mind:
2930	2933	This project doesn't concern cops. It's classified.
2933	2936	It's OCP. You got it, mister?
2939	2941	Yeah, I got it.
2941	2942	Good.
2945	2946	Sorry, sarge.
2947	2948	I fucked up.
2950	2953	Forget it, kid. This guy's a serious asshole.
2985	2989	Give me all your money, bookworm, or I blow your brains out.
2995	2997	Now fill it up on number seven.
3003	3005	Don't do nothing stupid, man.
3007	3008	I'm a good shot.
3011	3013	I can hit you from here.
3025	3026	Hey, man...
3026	3028	...what you reading in there?
3033	3036	You a college boy or something?
3038	3043	I'll bet you think you're smart. Think you could outsmart a bullet?
3044	3046	What do you say we find out, huh?
3046	3049	I'm talking to you! What do you say, huh?
3050	3052	I'm talking to you!
3054	3055	Drop it.
3059	3062	Dead or alive, you are coming with me.
3066	3067	I know you.
3068	3069	You're dead.
3071	3073	We killed you.
3074	3076	We killed you.
3078	3080	We killed you!
3093	3094	We killed you.
3140	3142	Who are you?
3144	3147	Who are you?
3161	3162	Can I help you, sir?
3163	3164	No.
3165	3167	What is it exactly that you want?
3167	3168	Hey.
3169	3170	You can't enter here.
3171	3174	Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.
3174	3177	This is a restricted area.
3185	3186	He's in.
3245	3247	Murphy, it's you.
3247	3250	Murphy, it's you.
3308	3311	Welcome, shopper. Let's take a stroll through your new home.
3312	3315	This is a one-family house built by ZM Industries.
3315	3317	Situated near schools and shops...
3317	3321	...this progressive development has a growth factor of seven.
3343	3344	Wow.
3345	3347	Can you do that, Dad?
3356	3359	Say, it doesn't matter who cooks in your family...
3359	3362	...because this kitchen by Food Concepts...
3362	3363	...makes everything a snap.
3384	3385	Dad.
3387	3389	Come on, get your hat on. Isn't he cute?
3390	3392	Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.
3412	3414	I really have to tell you something.
3418	3419	I love you.
3424	3426	The master bedroom.
3426	3431	Functional space with a touch of elegance.
3431	3435	Hey, have you thought it all over? Why not make me an offer?
3468	3470	Where is Clarence Boddicker?
3477	3478	Okay.
3485	3487	- Shit. - Let's talk.
3492	3493	Son of a bitch!
3498	3500	There's just something about the way it sounds:
3502	3503	"Vice president."
3504	3506	It just turns me on.
3507	3508	God, you girls are so great.
3509	3511	I love to be with intelligent women.
3511	3514	Smart is so sexy.
3514	3515	I know.
3516	3518	Sometimes, I could just think of something...
3519	3523	...and it could just get me so horny.
3524	3528	Yeah, well, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
3529	3531	I get bored so easily.
3534	3537	And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.
3538	3540	Yes, I do.
3540	3542	- Don't move. - I won't.
3548	3550	Bob, save some for me.
3550	3552	Don't worry.
3555	3558	Must be the champagne. Stay here.
3564	3566	How you doing?
3568	3570	Bitches, leave.
3572	3575	Gee, Bobby. Bye.
3575	3577	You gonna call me?
3578	3579	The fuck are you doing?
3580	3582	Do you know who I am?
3583	3586	If you think you'll get away with this, you got...
3588	3589	Goddamn it!
3592	3593	Stop!
3594	3597	I'll give you anything you want. Just, please, don't kill me.
3602	3604	Hello, buddy-boy.
3604	3606	Dick Jones here.
3606	3609	I guess you're on your knees about now...
3609	3611	...begging for your life.
3612	3613	Pathetic.
3614	3616	You don't feel so cocky now, do you?
3616	3619	Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it right now.
3619	3621	You know what the tragedy is here?
3623	3625	We could have been friends.
3626	3628	But you wouldn't go through proper channels.
3629	3631	You went over my head.
3632	3633	That hurt.
3634	3639	But life goes on. It's an old story, the fight for love and glory.
3641	3644	It helps if you think of it as a game.
3644	3646	Every game has a winner...
3647	3649	...and a loser.
3657	3660	I'm cashing you out, Bob.
3682	3684	I don't think I want to pay that, Sal.
3686	3689	I don't give a shit what you want. I set the prices here.
3690	3694	Listen, Sal, maybe you haven't heard. I'm the guy who owns Detroit.
3694	3696	You want space in my marketplace...
3697	3699	...you'll have to give me a volume discount.
3699	3702	Not into discounts.
3702	3706	Joe, show the man what we brought him for Christmas.
3713	3717	Think about it, chum. Good business is where you find it.
3724	3727	Okay, let me try to put this in perspective.
3728	3730	You've killed a bunch of cops.
3731	3735	Word around is that you've got a lot of heavy connections downtown.
3736	3738	You make a lot of my friends nervous.
3742	3743	A lot of people...
3744	3746	...want to see a guy like me...
3747	3749	...put a guy like you out of business.
3749	3751	I don't know.
3751	3752	I don't know.
3753	3756	Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.
3758	3761	I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.
3762	3764	But I got the connections.
3764	3767	I got the sales organization.
3767	3770	I got the muscle to shove enough of this factory...
3770	3772	...so far up your stupid wop ass...
3773	3775	...that you'll shit snow for a year.
3775	3777	Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.
3779	3782	Guns, guns, guns!
3783	3785	Come on, Sal!
3785	3788	The Tigers are playing tonight.
3789	3791	I never miss a game.
3797	3798	Just kidding.
3812	3813	Go!
3836	3839	Come quietly, or there will be trouble.
3841	3843	Fuck you!
3916	3917	Oh, shit!
3938	3940	Clarence Boddicker...
3941	3942	...you are under arrest.
3942	3944	You have the right to remain silent.
3945	3947	Fuck you!
3952	3955	Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
3955	3957	I'm protected, man. I've got protection!
3958	3960	- You have the right to an attorney. - What is this shit?!
3965	3967	Goddamn it.
3967	3971	Goddamn it! Listen to me! Listen to me, you fuck!
3971	3976	It's another guy! He's OCP. He's the senior president.
3976	3979	Anything you say may be used against you.
3979	3980	It's Dick Jones!
3985	3988	Don't you care, you cocksucker?
3989	3991	I work for Dick Jones!
3991	3993	Dick Jones!
3993	3998	He's the number two guy at OCP! OCP runs the cops!
3999	4001	You're a cop!
4004	4005	Cop...
4016	4019	Yes, I am a cop.
4023	4024	I don't like it either, but listen!
4025	4026	You listen to me, asshole!
4026	4030	You're talking about shutting down a major metropolitan police force!
4031	4034	Without cops, this city would tear itself apart!
4034	4037	The union voted for a strike last night!
4037	4038	We lost five guys last week!
4038	4040	We're getting creamed out there.
4050	4051	Book him.
4052	4053	What's the charge?
4057	4059	He's a cop killer.
4065	4067	Shit!
4067	4070	Just give me my fucking phone call.
4077	4080	I understand. The lawyers will have you out in 24 hours.
4081	4083	Just don't say anything else.
4084	4086	Jesus, you really screwed up.
4148	4149	Don't you care?
4150	4153	I work for Dick Jones! Dick Jones!
4156	4158	I work for Dick Jones!
4159	4162	He runs OCP! OCP runs the cops!
4166	4168	Come in, officer.
4168	4170	I don't usually see anyone without an appointment...
4170	4172	...but in your case, I'll make an exception.
4172	4173	You are under arrest.
4175	4176	On what charge?
4176	4178	Aiding and abetting a known felon.
4179	4182	Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.
4184	4185	Better take me in.
4185	4186	I will.
4200	4201	What's the matter, officer?
4204	4206	I'll tell you what's the matter.
4207	4210	It's a little insurance policy called "Directive 4."
4210	4214	My little contribution to your psychological profile.
4215	4220	Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP results in shutdown.
4223	4225	What did you think?
4227	4229	That you were an ordinary police officer?
4229	4231	You're our product...
4231	4234	...and we can't have our products turning against us.
4239	4241	Still a little fight left in you.
4247	4249	Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.
4256	4258	I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.
4259	4262	Now it's time to erase that mistake.
4332	4335	Get me Hedgecock! There's trouble in the tower!
4407	4409	Prepare to fire.
4410	4413	- Wait a second! - He's a cop, for God's sake!
4413	4415	- You can't do that! - We have orders to destroy it!
4416	4418	- Oh, shit! - You're maniacs!
4418	4419	Fire at will!
4438	4439	Move in!
4499	4501	Murphy, it's me.
4504	4505	Lewis.
4519	4522	Level three! He's on level three!
4522	4523	Over here, over here!
4523	4525	Open fire!
4543	4544	It's back.
4545	4547	Big is back. Because bigger is better.
4548	4551	6000 SUX, an American tradition.
4552	4554	Good evening. I'm Jess Perkins with Casey Wong.
4555	4557	Top story: Santa Barbara.
4557	4559	Ten thousand acres of wooded residential land...
4559	4562	...were scorched in an instant when a laser canon...
4562	4565	...aboard the Strategic Defense Peace Platform...
4565	4567	...misfired today during routine tests.
4568	4570	It was a day of mourning for the families...
4570	4573	...of 113 people known dead at this hour.
4573	4575	Among them, two former U.S. presidents...
4575	4578	...who had retired in the Santa Barbara area.
4578	4580	A day of mourning for a country.
4580	4584	Police union representatives and OCP continued negotiations today...
4584	4587	...in hopes of averting a citywide strike by police...
4588	4590	...scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.
4590	4592	Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.
4592	4595	They're still on duty. But what about tomorrow?
4595	4599	That's the question we put to people in the crime-plagued Lexington area.
4599	4602	They're public servants. They got job security.
4602	4604	They're not supposed to strike.
4604	4606	It's a free society.
4606	4609	Except there ain't nothing free, because there's no guarantees.
4610	4613	You're on your own. That's the law of the jungle.
4617	4620	- Be very careful. - Excuse me, please.
4622	4623	Remodeling.
4629	4631	Hi, Barbara.
4632	4635	Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.
4635	4638	But when I'm done, I've got some free time.
4638	4641	Maybe you could fit me in.
4643	4645	He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.
4649	4650	You can keep the gum.
4658	4661	Hey, Dickie-boy. How's tricks?
4661	4663	That thing is still alive.
4663	4664	What are you talking about?
4665	4668	The police officer who arrested you, the one you spilled your guts to.
4670	4675	Take a look at my face, Dick. He was trying to kill me.
4676	4678	He's a cyborg, you idiot!
4679	4682	He recorded every word you said.
4682	4684	His memory's admissible as evidence!
4685	4686	You involved me!
4689	4691	You'll have to kill it.
4694	4696	Well, listen, chief.
4697	4700	Your company built the fucking thing.
4700	4702	Now I gotta deal with it?
4703	4706	I don't have time for this bullshit!
4706	4710	Suit yourself. But Delta City begins construction in two months.
4710	4712	That's 2 million workers living in trailers.
4713	4717	That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.
4718	4722	Virgin territory for the man who knows how to open up new markets.
4722	4725	One man could control it all...
4725	4727	...Clarence.
4728	4731	Well, I guess we're gonna be friends after all.
4732	4733	Richard.
4740	4742	Destroy it.
4743	4746	Gonna need some major firepower.
4748	4750	You got access to military weaponry?
4752	4754	We practically are the military.
4793	4794	Did you bring the gun?
4794	4798	The precinct was deserted. Half the force didn't show up for work today.
4798	4802	Everyone else walks out at midnight. I guess we're on strike.
4802	4804	I wasn't sure what you needed.
4804	4806	I sort of grabbed things.
4808	4810	Your gun.
4811	4813	You asked for this?
4817	4819	I brought you some food.
4820	4822	No, thank you.
4822	4823	I'm not hungry.
4846	4848	You may not like what you're going to see.
4884	4886	It's really good to see you again, Murphy.
4891	4894	Murphy had a wife and son. Where are they?
4896	4898	Well, after the funeral...
4898	4901	...she moved away. - Where did they go?
4903	4904	She thought you were dead.
4905	4907	She started over again.
4909	4911	I can feel them.
4915	4917	But I can't remember them.
4923	4925	Leave me alone.
4972	4976	Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.
4977	4979	Well, hey, can I have you both?
4980	4981	Sure!
4981	4984	We've had our shots.
4985	4987	I'd buy that for a dollar.
4993	4996	Hey, Emil. How's the Gray Bar Hotel?
4996	5000	Not bad. They let me keep the shirt. And nobody popped my cherry.
5000	5003	Emil, how you doing, man? Good to see you.
5004	5009	I get out of jail for free, then I find this in the prison parking lot.
5009	5013	A brand-new 6000 SUX. Still got the factory sticker on it!
5013	5014	Hey, Clarence!
5015	5017	Joey's got a car just like yours, man!
5018	5020	Clarence, what do you think, buddy?
5027	5030	What do you got there, Clarence, huh?
5030	5034	Whoa, a new toy. Can I play?
5037	5038	Watch this.
5038	5040	Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
5042	5044	Aw, shit!
5047	5048	- Fuck! - Nice car, Joe.
5048	5051	- Fuck you, Clarence. - Let me try that.
5051	5054	Cobra assault canon. State-of-the-art. Bang, bang.
5062	5064	I like it!
5064	5067	- Give it up, faggot little man. - Get your own!
5068	5069	Come on!
5080	5081	Do it, Emil!
5088	5091	Check this out! Heads up, you guys!
5100	5102	He's in the steel mill. Let's go.
5102	5105	All right, cut the horseshit! We're moving out.
5105	5107	Come on, Emil! Get your ass in the van.
5107	5109	Come on, lard-ass! Let's move it!
5109	5111	Forget you, faggot!
5165	5166	What are you doing?
5168	5171	My targeting system is a little messed up.
5174	5175	Can I help you?
5176	5178	Aim for me.
5189	5192	- Are you locked in now? - Yes.
5193	5194	A little more to the left.
5195	5196	Here.
5205	5207	- I figure that's dead-on. - Thank you.
5226	5229	Come on, man, let's smoke him!
5230	5233	The wrecking crew is here! Where is that mother...?
5233	5235	Give that up, man!
5236	5239	Nothing fancy. Just kill him. Emil!
5239	5241	- What? - In the van.
5243	5247	- You should get out of here now. - Hey, we're partners.
5248	5249	Get the car.
5285	5287	Damn it. Shit!
5287	5288	Looking for me?
5302	5302	Cut him off!
5303	5307	Come on! Go on! Cut him off! Go, go!
5338	5341	Okay! Now I got you!
5403	5404	Help me.
5405	5407	Don't touch me, man!
5409	5410	Help me.
5429	5430	Shit!
5458	5461	- Bye-bye, baby. - Clarence!
5487	5488	Okay.
5488	5490	I give up.
5490	5492	I'm not arresting you anymore.
5492	5495	Hey. Now, wait a second.
5501	5505	Wait a minute. You're taking this kind of personal.
5506	5507	Come on, man.
5507	5511	You're making me nervous. Come on, you can't do this.
5511	5513	Come on now! Don't mess around! Hey. Hey!
5515	5516	Now, don't get cute!
5522	5523	Die, you bastard!
5523	5525	Yeah! Yeah!
5526	5528	All right! All right!
5528	5530	I got him, Clarence! I got him!
5558	5560	Sayonara, Robocop!
5575	5576	Lewis!
5578	5579	Lewis!
5582	5585	Murphy, I'm a mess.
5588	5589	They'll fix you.
5590	5592	They fix everything.
5602	5604	The police strike could work for us.
5604	5607	We can have ED 209s in place all over the city...
5607	5609	...and expect immediate public support.
5609	5612	I've got one downstairs guarding the building now.
5620	5623	You're illegally parked on private property.
5623	5626	You have 20 seconds to move your vehicle.
5661	5663	Whatever happens...
5663	5666	...this corporation will live up to its guiding principles:
5666	5670	Courage, strength, conviction.
5673	5678	We will meet each new challenge with the same aggressive attitude.
5687	5689	How can we help you, officer?
5689	5692	Dick Jones is wanted for murder.
5692	5696	This is absurd! That thing is a violent mechanical psychopath!
5697	5701	My program will not allow me to act against an officer of this company.
5701	5704	These are serious charges. What is your evidence?
5715	5718	I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.
5719	5722	Now it's time to erase that mistake.
5723	5726	I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.
5727	5730	Now it's time to erase that mistake.
5734	5735	I want a chopper! Now!
5736	5739	We will walk to the roof very calmly.
5739	5743	I will board the chopper with my hostage.
5744	5746	Anybody tries to stop me...
5748	5749	...the old geezer gets it.
5752	5755	Dick, you're fired!
5756	5757	Thank you.
5783	5785	Nice shooting, son. What's your name?
5788	5789	Murphy.
