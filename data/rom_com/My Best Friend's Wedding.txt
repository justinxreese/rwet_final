213	215	''V. I.P.'' Very important table right here!
222	223	Give me two grain!
225	228	- I'll take that polenta! - All right, Chef.
228	230	- This is the one I'm waiting for! - Yes, sir.
230	234	I need that special meat now. Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.
234	236	I will kill your family it you don't get this right. I need this perfect.
236	237	Yes, sir.
256	258	I'm writing it up as...
258	261	inventive and...
261	262	confident.
267	272	- Did the chap from Newsday ever call? - I'll check my machine.
273	276	Is this a real interview or some cute guy...
276	278	- you're setting me up with? - Please, Julianne.
278	281	I don't send you men anymore. You have no idea what to do with them.
281	285	it’s Michael. Jules, it must be months, huh?
285	291	l can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.
291	295	Call me. 4:00 in the morning, whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.
295	299	- Who called? Man of the moment? - No, the opposite.
299	303	It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal. Sounds desperate to talk to me.
303	307	The wandering sportswriter. Remind me about that one.
307	308	Sophomore year at Brown...
308	312	we had this one hot month.
312	316	But you know me. I got restless.
316	320	So I get up the nerve to break his heart...
320	322	and he gives me this look.
323	325	Then he said, ''The thing that makes me want to cry is...
325	329	I'm losing the best friend I ever had.''
329	332	At that moment, I knew I tell the same way.
332	336	So I cried for maybe the third time in my entire life...
336	338	kissed him...
338	341	and we've been best friends ever since.
342	344	We've seen each other through everything:
346	348	losing jobs...
348	351	losing parents, losing lovers.
351	354	We've traveled all over.
354	356	The best times of my life, maybe.
356	361	Drinking and talking, even if it's just over the phone.
361	364	Go on. This is so moving. Kindred spirits?
364	368	He's nothing Like me. He's Like you actually, only straight.
369	373	I remember this one night in Tucson six years ago.
373	376	He takes a razor out of this little shaving kit...
376	379	cuts his finger, takes my hand, does the same to me.
379	382	- I'm gonna be sick. - He says, ''Swear when we're 28...
382	385	if we've never married, we marry each other.''
385	388	We never talked about it again.
388	391	I don't know what made me think of that.
391	395	You're about to be 28 in three weeks, right?
396	400	- How old is he? - You think?
400	403	Desperate to talk.
411	413	Cheers.
415	418	''Digital Answering System'' ''Play''
425	426	''Red''
434	438	- Good evening. The Drake Hotel. - I'm calling for Michael O'Neal...
438	441	- but since it's so late-- - One moment, please.
443	444	Hello?
447	450	You've been enrolled in the Obscene caller of the Month Club.
450	453	Hey, beautiful. it’s so great to hear your voice.
453	456	l miss you. I've been calling you for over a month.
456	458	I've been on a book tour.
458	461	- I figured you were out of town. - My machine eats all my messages.
461	464	Or you're just averaging 30 days to return a call.
464	468	- it’s less when it's you. - I have to ask you something important.
468	470	lf you turn me down, l don't know what I'll do.
470	474	It I could just tell you one thing first.
476	480	This is probably going to hand you...
480	483	the biggest laugh of your adult life...
483	485	but I was thinking about you, and I was remembering...
485	490	this unbelievably insane night we spent in Tucson...
490	493	like a thousand years ago.
493	496	- You probably won't remember this-- - Are you kidding?
496	499	l think about that night all the time.
499	501	You do?
501	504	But it's not why I called.
504	505	It's not.
505	509	l called because I met someone.
511	513	That's great.
513	518	You haven't really seen anybody since that dingbat Jenny Lee, have you?
518	519	You don't understand.
519	522	I've never felt this way about anybody.
522	526	- She's all wrong for me. - That's a good start.
526	528	She's a junior at the University of Chicago.
528	532	She's 20. Her name's Kim. You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.
532	535	Her dad is this billionaire. He owns the White Sox and some cable empire.
535	538	I've always been uncomfortable around rich people.
538	542	- Sure. - But they're not like that.
542	546	They're such wonderful people. Salt of the earth.
546	549	So you've met her parents?
550	554	Jules, we're getting married this Sunday.
556	558	- Hello? - Michael--
560	562	It's Wednesday night.
562	565	How can you possibly be getting married on Sunday?
565	566	Actually, it starts tomorrow.
566	569	it’s a four-day wedding with all the traditional events...
569	574	and 10 million people flying in from all over the world.
574	578	Aren't you working this weekend? Is that responsible?
578	583	The Sox are at home and Sports is letting me do a profile on Frank Thomas.
583	586	Wait. What do you mean, irresponsible?
586	588	Taking off a weekend to get married?
590	592	Jules, I'm scared.
594	598	- Maybe we should talk about this. - I need you.
598	601	lf you can't come and hold my hand, I'll never get through this.
601	603	Please come.
606	609	l can 't wait for you to meet her.
609	613	''United Airlines'' Listen, Jules.
613	615	Let's stop for a drink. You can take a later flight.
615	619	I'm a busy girl. I've got four days to break up a wedding...
619	623	steal the bride's fellow, and I haven't one clue how to do it.
623	626	He adored me for nine goddamn years.
626	629	- I can see why. - She has known him for five seconds.
629	633	Plus, she's got billions of dollars, and she's apparently perfect.
633	637	So don't go feeling all sorry for Miss Preteen Illinois.
640	643	l can't lose him, George. I'm going to bring him back.
645	646	You give your hand to me
646	649	You give your hand to me
649	652	And then you say hello
653	656	l can hardly speak
656	659	My heart is beating so
659	663	And anyone can tell
663	666	You think you know me well
666	670	But you don't know me
672	677	No, you don't know the one
677	680	Who dreams of you at night
680	684	Wants to kiss your lips
684	687	Wants to hold you tight
687	690	l am just a friend
690	694	That's all I've ever been
694	697	- Can you believe I'm gonna do this? - Not hardly.
713	716	This just makes everything so perfect.
716	720	Since I've met Michael, all I've heard is ''Julianne this'' and ''Julianne that.''
721	723	I've never had a sister.
731	734	I have this monstrous favor to ask you.
734	735	- Excuse me? - My best friend...
735	741	shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abilene over spring break.
741	743	- Be my maid of honor? - What?
745	750	Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid or someone you've known longer?
750	753	My bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under the age of 40...
753	757	debutante sisters from Nashville who are basically vengeful sluts.
757	758	My exit!
761	764	I have tour days to make you my new best friend.
764	767	It's time for you to force yourself to get personal.
781	784	- Do you like the color? - I think it's beautiful.
784	786	- Isn't that perfect for her? - absolutely.
786	789	This is going to be tighter. You don't want those things to fall out.
789	792	- It's beautiful. - I'm not hurting you.
792	797	I don't want her to trip, so I'll take this up a tiny bit.
797	799	Would you rather the daffodil?
801	805	I thought the bridesmaids all wore the same dress.
805	809	Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable unless you were distinctive.
812	814	What else did he tell you?
814	817	You hate weddings. You never go.
817	820	You're not up for anything conventional...
820	823	or anything that's assumed to be a female priority...
825	829	including marriage or romance or even--
829	831	Love?
833	835	Michael and I were a wrong tip right from the start.
835	838	He said that too.
838	842	I thought I was like you, and proud to be...
842	846	until I met rumpled, smelly, old Michael.
846	848	Then I found I was just a sentimental schmuck...
848	852	like all those flighty nitwits I'd always pitied.
852	854	It's funny, huh?
855	858	l need a cigarette.
866	868	George, how do you think I feel?
868	871	all she does is talk about her and Michael's future.
871	876	- She's just so dreamy. - Jules, pull yourself together.
876	878	I don't know if I can do it.
880	883	You want me to turn around or something?
883	887	Not the person I was expecting.
890	892	I've seen you a lot more naked than that.
894	899	Things are different now.
903	905	I guess so.
910	913	You look really good...
913	915	without your clothes on.
926	927	She's toast.
929	931	''Caution 2-Way Traffic'' ''Exit''
936	939	- Where is the honeymoon exactly? - It depends.
939	942	If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. ''Chicago Hilton And Towers''
942	945	Or Phoenix. Or depending on the Indiana-Cleveland game--
945	947	Garden spots, all.
947	950	A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit represents a packing challenge...
950	954	but there's tine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suites.
954	958	it’s his career. I'm supportive. I've been everywhere.
958	962	I want to be with the man I love. That's what makes it a honeymoon.
962	968	He's lucky. One woman in a billion could put up with his shit.
968	971	The guy's a one-man festival of idiosyncratic--
971	974	You've been introduced to the symphonic range--
974	977	Of his snoring? He says it's worse than ever.
977	979	You know that snarfle one?
982	986	Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing happening behind it.
994	995	Earplugs work.
995	998	- What about-- - Cigars in bed? I broke him of that.
998	1001	The bathroom's a swamp. He wears Reeboks to dinner.
1001	1005	He likes action movies. He reads over my Shoulder.
1005	1007	He loves karaoke bars...
1007	1009	- and I can't carry a tune. - Really?
1009	1012	He sucks soup through his front teeth.
1012	1015	That's a trademark move. Don't touch that one.
1017	1019	But he sure can kiss.
1022	1025	It's been a while. I'm just gonna take your word on that.
1031	1035	After two weeks of cataloging all his faults...
1035	1038	I made a command decision that changed my life.
1043	1045	I threw the list away.
1045	1047	He's not a balance sheet. He's Michael.
1047	1049	Loving him means loving all of him.
1049	1051	Do you get nervous in confined spaces?
1051	1053	It's sweet of you to want to be protective...
1053	1057	but nothing ever could give me one moment's pause about this marriage.
1057	1061	- Do you become hysterical in confined-- - Except one.
1062	1064	You. You're always in his mind....
1064	1067	this perfect creature he loved for years.
1067	1070	perfection can get wearing after awhile.
1070	1073	I'm not kidding. I had to face up to my competitive drives.
1073	1075	believe me, I've got them.
1075	1078	Am I gonna be jealous of you for the rest of my life?
1078	1080	- Our paths will keep crossing. - Space. of course.
1080	1082	- He'll always talk about you. - It's only natural.
1082	1085	The answer was so simple.
1085	1088	I was gonna predict that.
1088	1090	You win.
1092	1094	I've missed a step.
1095	1098	He's got you on a pedestal...
1098	1100	and me in his arms.
1108	1112	My God, it's the bride and the woman she'll never live up to.
1112	1115	- Are you okay, honey? - That would be us.
1115	1117	Did she say the wrong thing again? That is so in character.
1117	1120	- I'm Julianne Potter. - We'd be the vengeful sluts.
1120	1124	- You can just call us eager. - Have you sized up the groomsmen?
1124	1128	- As maid of honor, you get first pick. - Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.
1128	1130	- He's mine. - Kimmy's a virgin.
1130	1133	Is this Michael's Julianne?
1133	1135	I'm Isabelle Wallace.
1135	1138	My handsome new son scarcely did you justice.
1139	1143	My husband says to scoot you to the ballpark...
1143	1145	so you can hang with Michael.
1145	1148	But first you have to meet a lot of really old women.
1148	1151	That is, it you've absorbed enough profanity.
1165	1167	Who ordered a beer?
1167	1172	- Let me help you with that. - You unwittingly imply I'm clumsy.
1172	1174	Sorry. I was confusing you with somebody I used to know.
1174	1177	Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric from Sport magazine.
1177	1179	- Nice to meet you. - They kindly gave me a job.
1179	1182	- Hi, there. - How do you do?
1182	1185	And this is Walter, my father-in-Law.
1185	1188	Future father-in-Law. ''Comiskey''
1188	1189	Thank you.
1189	1192	If he gives you any grief, come see me.
1193	1197	- And this guy you know. - Papa Joe.
1197	1203	I told him to make you best man, but he had to go with his baby brother.
1203	1205	Best-looking guy in any room.
1205	1208	- Great to see you. - That will do.
1208	1212	- Scotty, that will do. - Sorry.
1212	1214	Remember, it is the duty of the best man...
1214	1218	to dance with the maid of honor.
1218	1220	Dance? You can't dance.
1220	1225	- When did you Learn to dance? - I've got moves you've never seen.
1226	1228	You're an impostor.
1230	1232	What did you do with my best friend?
1232	1236	''Chicago Tribune" I'm still your best friend.
1236	1238	You just haven't seen me for awhile.
1243	1247	Some people might find that kind of perfection boring...
1247	1251	- day after day, year after year. - That's what I thought at first.
1251	1253	How can you like someone that perfect?
1253	1256	No potential for long-range Likeability.
1256	1260	But then, she does have a few good traits.
1260	1262	- All right. - Such as?
1262	1264	They got him.
1264	1267	When I hug her, even in public...
1267	1270	I don't have to let go right away.
1270	1272	She lets me hold her as long as I want.
1272	1276	- Batting second, the shortstop-- - What?
1276	1279	- Nothing. - I forgot.
1279	1282	You and that yucky love stuff.
1282	1284	You always get like that when it gets sentimental.
1284	1286	I do not.
1288	1291	When we were-- When you and I were--
1291	1293	- When we were-- - Together?
1297	1299	Did I, when--
1299	1303	- Yes. - Yes, what?
1303	1306	You pulled away when I tried to hug you in public.
1312	1314	I've changed.
1314	1317	I mean, I'm not the girl that I once was.
1318	1320	Really?
1320	1323	Any relationship over two weeks I should know about?
1324	1326	This is not about longevity.
1327	1330	This is about...
1330	1332	being comfortable...
1332	1334	with the yucky love stuff.
1338	1339	all right.
1339	1342	And I am.
1345	1348	And it's wisdom born of pain
1348	1351	Yes, I've paid the price
1351	1354	But look how much I've gained

1374	1376	I didn't realize this was a karaoke bar.

1383	1385	- Blended, no salt. - She wants it straight up.
1385	1386	- You? - Amstel Light.

1397	1399	Me hanging on in the rain.
1399	1402	- I love Florence. - And the guy with the thing.
1404	1406	Where was my pass?
1406	1409	- ''No, the pier is for fishing!'' - ''French kissing?''
1409	1412	- ''Fishing!'' - I've always loved Florence.
1414	1418	You Should take her there. She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

1432	1436	I'm not coming back senior year.

1449	1452	I think the most important thing is for us to be together.
1452	1457	Say, Pinky, I wanna hear you sing. Come on.

1631	1633	That was just terrible!
1642	1646	''Steakhouse'' ''Park'' ''Taxi'' - You won't be lonely without us? - Desperately.
1646	1649	- Maybe we don't have to go. - Your grandmother's dinner?
1649	1653	As bride-to-be, she's got you on a technicality.
1653	1658	I'd baby-sit you, but my loyalty is to the bride in her time of need.
1658	1662	- It's not really a time of need. - If you're sure.
1662	1667	- ''Sure''? - I'll stay with Michael it you're sure.
1670	1673	- Call me later? - of course.
1677	1680	- Bye. - Have fun.
1692	1695	Were you pretty shocked when I told you?
1695	1697	Shocked? No.
1699	1701	A little.
1701	1705	A lot. I tell oft the bed.
1706	1709	That explains the thump.
1709	1711	You like her, don't you?
1713	1716	- I do. - That's enthusiastic.
1716	1720	I mean, she's-- She's great.
1723	1727	She seriously can't sing a note.
1727	1732	But to make that kind of sacrifice--
1732	1737	- What? Leaving school? - all of it.
1737	1741	Putting her career on hold to follow you around in this dumb job...
1741	1744	where you travel 52 weeks a year...
1744	1747	to places like College Station, Texas.
1747	1751	- ''Dumb job''? - It's not a grown-up job.
1751	1754	My job never bothered you before.
1754	1758	It doesn't bother me now, but I'm not Kimmy.
1758	1763	Her father owns the Sox and cable sports.
1765	1769	I'm just surprised it hasn't come up, that's all.
1769	1771	What?
1773	1775	The corner office with a view.
1775	1778	You in a nice blue suit.
1778	1782	Permanent Chicago address, somewhat close to Mom and Dad.
1782	1784	Never.
1784	1786	She would never even think of that.
1787	1789	You don't know her.
1798	1800	- But Michael loves his job. - Sure.
1800	1803	Bad games, bad pay, bad towns, bad flights...
1803	1806	bad hotels, real bad food...
1806	1808	homeless, rootless, lonely...
1808	1810	your copy makes it in one issue out of tour.
1810	1812	What's not to love?
1812	1816	Why would he trade that for running, say, a piece of the public relations...
1816	1820	at a powerful complex conglomerate like your father's?
1820	1824	- That's what my father and I discussed. - I'm not surprised.
1826	1829	So do you think he'd really accept?
1829	1831	Michael? A job like that?
1831	1835	It would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him.
1835	1837	Present company excepted.
1837	1842	This is what we do: We make your dad a coconspirator.
1842	1844	Michael does a favor for Walter.
1844	1847	Walter's reorganizing his public relations...
1847	1849	and needs a brilliant guy that he's close to...
1849	1852	that he can completely trust.
1852	1855	Then you beg. 'Michael, please do this for Daddy.
1855	1858	It's only six months. It would mean so much to me. "
1860	1865	- He'll see right through it. - Only if he wants to.
1866	1867	At the end of six months...
1867	1870	he will be happy...
1870	1872	settled...
1872	1874	successful.
1888	1890	Wow.
1891	1893	You look beautiful. Do you have a date later?
1893	1895	Never can tell.
1896	1900	Just the way you look tonight Remember?
1901	1905	Okay, kid, you're up.
1915	1918	It's really my father who needs the favor.
1920	1925	He's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company.
1925	1928	Public relations is a real problem area for him.
1931	1934	It would only be six months maybe.
1936	1940	- Or three or four. - You knew about this?
1940	1944	I think you ought to Listen to her. it’s her life too.
1947	1950	You gonna tell me that Walter thought this one up?
1950	1954	Why don't you start by being honest one second.
1954	1957	I am being honest.
1957	1960	all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop out of school...
1960	1962	forget my family, forget my career...
1962	1967	- forget the things I had planned? - Forgive me for screwing up your plans.
1967	1970	Glad I heard this before it's too Late.
1970	1973	- What is that supposed to mean? - What am I supposed to do with my life?
1973	1976	I work in a low-paying, zero-respect job...
1976	1979	which, unfortunately, I happen to love.
1982	1987	- It sounds like a great opportunity. - Does it really?
1987	1991	How come you never took some sellout establishment job?
1991	1993	I'll tell you why, because that isn't you.
1993	1996	- And it's not me either. - lf that's the way you feel--
1996	2000	Damn straight that's how I feel ! Just come out and say it.
2000	2003	My job's not good enough. I'm not good enough.
2003	2008	- I never said that! - Yes, you did.
2010	2012	Great, Kim.
2012	2016	Two days before our wedding, you Lay this on me. I'm supposed to roll over?
2019	2023	Fine. I'm an insensitive. sexist asshole.
2023	2024	You're better oft without me.
2026	2031	You are so right. l was so wrong.
2031	2034	We settled this, and I reneged. That just wasn't fair.
2034	2039	You have to forgive me and forget this happened or I'll just die.
2039	2041	Please.
2046	2047	I'm sorry.
2073	2075	George and Werner are not in.
2075	2078	Brevity is the order of the day.
2078	2080	George, answer this, damn it
2080	2083	I'm in a meltdown here! She double-crossed me!
2083	2088	The little twerp groveled She's so wrong for him.
2088	2093	Michael and I are the same person: self-absorbed and vaguely loveable.
2093	2095	We deserve each other. I'm running out of time.
2095	2099	I'm completely out of sneaky ideas. l have come to the end...
2099	2101	of my rapidly fraying rope!
2101	2103	You have got to think of something!
2108	2111	- Coffee, anyone? - That would be wonderful.
2114	2117	''The Drake''
2148	2152	This is very Marcel Marceau.
2152	2157	Now, relax. We don't want your face coming off with it, do we?
2157	2158	What a hideous room.
2160	2163	Death by a mini-bar. How glamorous.
2167	2170	You flew all the way here. You hate to fly.
2170	2174	I have to go back this evening. We have a family thing in the Hamptons.
2174	2176	You're butting in.
2177	2180	What I mean when I say she's annoyingly perfect...
2180	2183	is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection.
2183	2188	It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
2188	2190	You like her.
2190	2192	It I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
2194	2196	This is my whole life's happiness.
2196	2198	I have to be ruthless.
2200	2202	He was in love with me every day for nine years.
2202	2204	I can make him happier than she can.
2204	2206	I am breaking her heart in the short run...
2206	2209	but really doing her a gigantic favor.
2209	2214	She would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
2223	2225	Do you really love him...
2225	2227	or is this just about winning?
2227	2229	Seriously.
2232	2237	In the beginning, it was mostly this prior claim.
2237	2239	He belonged to me.
2241	2245	But now, when I'm with him...
2245	2249	he's just so wonderful.
2249	2254	How come I never knew that when I could have had him?
2254	2257	It's amazing the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy.
2260	2262	George, believe me...
2262	2265	if he was feeling what I'm feeling...
2265	2268	then he would know how I feel.
2268	2270	It's horrible.
2270	2272	What?
2274	2276	Just tell him you love him.
2278	2283	tell him you've loved him for nine years...
2283	2285	but you were afraid of love.
2287	2290	Tell him you were afraid of love, afraid of needing.
2290	2293	- Needing what? - To belong to someone.
2293	2295	We all are, sweetheart.
2295	2298	I'm sorry about that.
2298	2303	Tell him this is the worst, cruelest, dumbest moment to do this to him...
2303	2305	but there it is.
2305	2307	He's got to choose.
2309	2312	tell him the actual truth?
2312	2316	Maybe not the actual truth.
2316	2319	Highlights.
2325	2328	Arms at your sides, Please.
2340	2343	- Good morning. - I have to talk to you.
2343	2346	- You don't like the suit? - That's not what I have to talk about.
2346	2349	One thing first. Excuse me.
2355	2359	- Guard this with your life. - What is it?
2359	2361	- The ring. - Why are you giving it to me?
2361	2364	- I don't trust Scotty with it. - I don't think--
2364	2366	Please.
2366	2369	You're practically the best man anyway.
2369	2372	- Thank you. - Open it.
2373	2375	will she like it?
2382	2385	- What did you want to talk about? - What?
2385	2386	You wanted to talk about something?
2391	2395	We've known each other a long time, right? Twenty years?
2395	2398	Not that long, but a long time.
2398	2400	And in that time...
2400	2404	we've grown close.
2405	2408	Very close. Do you know what I mean?
2408	2411	- I think so. - Good. So do I.
2411	2414	So sometimes--
2417	2418	could you excuse us?
2423	2425	Sometimes...
2425	2428	people think...
2428	2430	they know how they feel about each other...
2430	2432	but they don't...
2433	2435	until...
2436	2438	until they do.
2440	2441	I have a point.
2442	2445	- Am I getting to it? - Why don't you?
2445	2448	Whatever it is you have to say can't be that big a deal.
2452	2457	''A big deal'' is a relative term.
2470	2472	Who's that guy?
2475	2478	It's George. I've told you about George. He's my editor.
2478	2481	What's he doing here? You working this weekend?
2484	2488	- He's here to be with me. - Why?
2489	2494	Because he's my friend. He's my good friend.
2494	2496	My best friend these days.
2500	2502	You've been busy.
2504	2508	So all of this has been about George?
2529	2531	I'm speechless.
2531	2533	That's Jules.
2533	2534	- Congratulations. - Congratulations.
2534	2536	What?
2536	2540	I told him, puppy. If we're engaged, we Shouldn't be ashamed of it.
2542	2546	He's racing back to New York. He just came in for a few hours...
2546	2549	to fuck me.
2553	2556	Takes a few hours.
2559	2560	God.
2563	2565	Give me your ring. Give it to me!
2565	2569	When you ask a girl to marry you, you have to give an engagement ring.
2569	2572	I can't believe you're doing this to me. I've come all this way to help you.
2572	2576	- You're insane! - For one day find me irresistible.
2584	2586	Stop it.
2590	2592	Is something wrong?
2594	2598	I guess it's just the way you've always talked about George.
2598	2601	It always seemed...
2601	2604	seemed like--
2604	2608	- It sounded like George was-- - Gay?
2608	2609	Actually, yes.
2611	2614	Common misconception.
2616	2618	It is.
2618	2623	George likes to pretend that he's gay.
2629	2631	And why would you do that?
2632	2635	I find it attracts women.
2635	2637	Indeed. Worked for me.
2637	2639	Big time.
2643	2645	Right.
2650	2653	Oh, my God. Race you to the altar.
2654	2656	- Underplay. - Got it.
2656	2658	I'm Jules' fiance, George.
2658	2663	Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal visit, it you catch my drift.
2663	2664	I do.
2665	2668	- You're going to humiliate me. - Only if I can.
2668	2670	Just one thing. Stay away from--
2670	2673	George! Oh, my God!
2675	2680	- I don't know why I'm so carried away. - Me neither.
2680	2681	It's so--
2683	2685	Against God's plan?
2685	2688	No! It's just wonderful !
2688	2690	It's so wonderful!
2694	2696	Mom!
2700	2703	- What? - You have to meet George.
2703	2706	You must be Kimmy's little sister.
2706	2709	Julianne's fiance. They're going to be married.
2709	2711	- What's going on? - Julianne's getting married.
2711	2714	- Why didn't you tell us? - There hasn't been time.
2714	2717	I wanted to. I wanted to shout it from the rooftops...
2717	2721	but Jules said, ''No, Pumpkin, no.
2721	2723	This is Kimmy's day.
2723	2725	Let's not take the attention away from Kimmy.
2726	2728	Dear, sweet...
2728	2731	adorable, chocolate-covered Kimmy.''
2732	2734	Those were her very words.
2734	2736	I think I'm gonna cry.
2736	2738	Me too.
2738	2741	This is so sweet of you to come to our rehearsal.
2741	2743	I insist you stay for lunch.
2743	2745	- No, absolutely-- - Love to.
2745	2749	Love the bag, love the shoes, love everything. Love to.
2749	2753	- Darling, what about your flight? - Canceled.
2759	2763	I can tell you this now, but I was very worried about you.
2763	2765	About me?
2765	2768	All those stories that Michael told me were hilarious...
2768	2772	but all those broken relationships, all those men.
2772	2775	It must have hurt going through so many guys and never finding the right one.
2775	2779	She couldn't sit down for seven years until she met teensy-weensy little me.
2780	2783	And the man of your dreams was always there.
2786	2788	She's talking about me.
2789	2791	Yes, Darling?
2791	2795	- How did you and Julianne meet? - George is my editor.
2795	2798	But, Poopy, we met a long time before that.
2798	2801	Actually, it's a very romantic story.
2801	2804	would you like to tell it, Sweet Pea?
2804	2807	- It's private. - Not anymore.
2809	2812	I first met Julianne...
2812	2814	in a mental institution.
2815	2818	Julianne was there visiting some French chef...
2818	2820	she'd sent insane with a bad review...
2820	2822	and I was there visiting Dionne Warwick.
2824	2826	He thought he was Dionne Warwick.
2826	2830	- Who is Dionne Warwick? - Sacrilege, darling.
2830	2832	She's Whitney Houston's aunt.
2832	2834	She's very good on the Psychic Friends Network.
2834	2839	- Isn't she? - Do you know the way to San Jose
2845	2849	There I was with Dionne. His real name, by the way, is Jerry.
2849	2852	We were having a sing-along, then suddenly...
2852	2856	breezing through the doors from the shock therapy room...
2856	2858	I saw her.
2858	2860	A vision in pink.
2862	2865	- You don't wear pink. - She does.
2865	2868	Sometimes she does wear pink.
2868	2870	- You do. - I do.
2870	2873	l said to Dionne...
2873	2876	''Dionne, who is this vision?
2876	2880	Surely, she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star.
2880	2882	Look at her skin. Who does her hair?''
2882	2885	- In that moment, I knew. - We don't all need to know--
2885	2887	We do!
2890	2894	- I'm very curious. - They do.
2894	2897	I knew...
2897	2899	that someday we'd end up like this:
2899	2902	like some glittering...
2902	2906	Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza.
2908	2909	l said to Dionne...
2909	2912	''Dionne, I'm in love.
2912	2915	Could this siren love me?
2915	2918	Are the gods that kind?''
2918	2924	And Dionne turned to me, opened her lovely eyes and said...
2930	2932	What did she say?
2934	2936	The moment I wake up
2939	2942	Before I put on my makeup
2942	2946	I say a little prayer for you
2948	2950	While combing my hair now
2952	2955	While wondering what dress to wear now
2955	2958	I say a little prayer for you
2958	2962	Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart
2962	2964	And I will love you
2964	2967	Forever and ever We never will part
2967	2968	Oh, how I love you
2968	2971	Together forever That's how it must be
2971	2974	To live without you would only mean
2974	2977	Heartbreak for me
2977	2979	Go, Granddaddy!
2981	2983	l run for the bus, dear
2984	2988	While riding l think of us, dear
2992	2994	At work I just take time
2995	2998	And all through my coffee break time
3021	3024	My darling, believe me
3025	3030	For me there is no one but you
3032	3035	- Please love me too - Answer his prayer
3035	3038	- And I'm in love with you - Answer his prayer now
3038	3040	Answer my prayer, baby
3041	3044	Say you love me too
3068	3070	all right, now!
3072	3075	- Heartbreak for you, actually. - You've made your point.
3075	3081	Get on your plane. I'll call at the turn of the century when I've forgiven you.
3083	3086	- It never would have worked out. - Because it was dishonest.
3086	3088	Different temperaments.
3091	3094	Look, tell him you love him.
3095	3097	Bite the bullet.
3108	3110	What will he do?
3110	3112	''Be Careful Watch Your Step''
3119	3122	He'll choose Kim.
3122	3125	You'll stand beside her at the wedding...
3125	3128	kiss him good-bye and go home.
3130	3132	That's what you came here to do.
3134	3135	So do it.
3152	3155	George isn't my fiance, Michael.
3155	3157	It's been over for ages...
3157	3159	but he can't accept it.
3159	3162	I'd built you up so much...
3162	3165	l couldn't let him lose face in front of you.
3165	3171	He could never stack up to the one man I measure everyone against.
3177	3179	This is strange.
3180	3183	I gotta tell you, when you--
3183	3186	When you told me that you were marrying George...
3188	3192	I got this really strange--
3195	3197	You were jealous?
3203	3204	Crazy jealous.
3206	3208	I'm sorry.
3214	3218	Can we maybe spend some time alone this afternoon?
3221	3224	would that be ail right?
3251	3256	I've been thinking a lot the Last couple of days, about us.
3256	3258	Have you?
3262	3265	- There are a lot of memories. - It's more than that.
3267	3271	It's kind of embarrassing to say it this way, but...
3273	3276	you've sort of been, you know...
3276	3279	the woman in my life.
3280	3284	You've been the man in mine.
3284	3287	And I was thinking this could be our last time...
3287	3290	alone together, you know?
3292	3295	Except for that hot affair we'll have twice a year.
3295	3297	Except for that.
3304	3309	I mean, you commit to this wedding...
3309	3314	and then it seems like there's this momentum...
3314	3316	and then you forget you chose it.
3322	3324	You and I didn't--
3324	3329	In our relationships with other people...
3329	3333	we didn't use the word love a lot, did we?
3336	3340	Kimmy says it you love someone...
3340	3342	you say it.
3342	3344	You say it right then, out loud.
3346	3350	Otherwise, the moment just--
3350	3352	Passes you by.
3374	3376	We don't even have a song.
3377	3381	Kimmy and I don't have a song.
3383	3385	Do you think that's a bad sign?
3389	3391	Someday
3391	3394	When I'm awfully low
3394	3396	And the world is cold
3396	3401	l will feel a glow just thinking of you
3403	3408	And the way you look tonight
3409	3411	Is your dance card tilled?
3411	3414	I'd have to check. I keep it on Powerbook these days.
3414	3416	Is that right?
3419	3421	With each word
3421	3424	Your tenderness grows
3426	3430	Tearing my fears apart
3432	3437	With each laugh that wrinkles your nose
3437	3441	Touches my foolish heart
3479	3481	Excuse me.
3484	3488	- I thought Michael was picking me up. - I said I'd drop you at the stag.
3488	3491	He's got a lot to do. I'm the unofficial best man.
3491	3493	Of course.
3493	3498	Kim said when Michael turned the job down that there was no friction.
3498	3500	Friction? No.
3500	3502	Good.
3502	3505	I haven't caused a problem, have I?
3505	3507	You haven't. Nobody has.
3509	3512	Listen, you're just a little bit early.
3512	3514	Actually, I needed to make some phone calls.
3514	3517	- Is it possible to use your office? - of course.
3517	3519	- At the end of the hall on the left. - Thank you.
3521	3523	Take your time.
3531	3533	E-mall.
3534	3537	''File'' ''New Letter'' ''Open'' ''Close'' New letter.
3544	3548	To: Eric Isaacson...
3548	3554	''Mall Out'' Senior editor, Sport Magazine.
3554	3558	From: Walter Wallace.
3560	3564	You can do this. It's easy. Just do it fast, get it over with.
3564	3566	It's like it never happened.
3567	3571	Eric, I need a favor.
3571	3575	My daughter's every happiness...
3575	3577	is in your hands.
3577	3581	I have offered Mike O'Neal...
3581	3584	my new son-in-Law...
3584	3587	a great opportunity...
3587	3589	in my company.
3589	3592	To his own detriment...
3592	3594	Michael will not...
3594	3598	accept our offer...
3598	3602	while he works for you.
3627	3630	My daughter joins me in this plea...
3630	3634	for your cooperation.
3634	3638	With gratitude, Walter.
3638	3640	''Do You Wish To Send?'' ''Yes'' ''No''
3641	3645	Why would I send this? He'd get tired.
3647	3649	''Save For Later'' ''Delete''
3653	3654	Save for later.
3659	3661	It's not like I'm sending it.
3661	3664	I'm just saving it for a few hours...
3664	3667	till we come back here and...
3667	3669	Michael can see it.
3669	3671	Perfectly harmless.
3711	3712	''Wallace Company''
3724	3727	Send out this, this, not this, this.
3727	3729	That's it.
3729	3734	I'm holding tour or five e-malls I wrote over lunch. Send those too.
3734	3737	- Yes, sir. - Bye.
3737	3739	all set?
3740	3743	I can't believe this! Did you try every key?
3743	3745	It's no big deal. She just gave us the wrong keys.
3745	3749	There's got to be a janitor or a guard...
3749	3753	or a cleaning woman or, you know, some kind of--
3753	3758	Somebody has to be in this building! I need a brick.
3758	3760	What's the big deal about getting this tile tonight?
3761	3764	- I'm up against a deadline. - Me too.
3764	3767	- I'm getting married tomorrow. - That's my point!
3767	3769	Everybody will be busy with more important things...
3769	3772	and this is really my last chance.
3772	3775	If I could just get up to Walter's office, they're by the computer.
3775	3778	Then I could just e-mail those figures right out now!
3778	3780	Tomorrow's Sunday.
3780	3782	Nobody's doing business.
3782	3786	Monday morning, crack of dawn, Walter will walk you right up there.
3788	3790	Give it up, kid.
3791	3793	Can't win them all.
3807	3808	Good night.
3817	3820	This thing mean that much to you?
3823	3825	We'll use the phone in your room.
3825	3828	Walter's probably not even asleep.
3828	3831	- I'll drive you up there. - Thank you !
3831	3834	We'll get the right key, and we'll go back to the office.
3834	3837	If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow, you'd better be there.
3837	3839	I'll be there.
3839	3844	These are all from Eric. This fax is from Eric too.
3844	3846	My wedding. You'd think my boss would leave me alone.
3846	3848	Maybe it's Congratulations.
3859	3861	What is it?
3868	3871	''Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding...
3871	3875	but I think you need and deserve...
3875	3877	to know what you're marrying into.
3881	3885	I received the following e-mall this afternoon:
3886	3890	'Eric, I need a favor. My daughter's every--'''
3892	3894	Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.
3894	3897	- Is anything wrong? - No, I'm just tired.
3897	3900	Please put her on. Thanks.
3903	3905	could you give me a minute?
3907	3908	Please?
3956	3959	Excuse me, miss. Are you locked out?
3962	3966	Just stepped out. It's a no-smoking room.
3968	3970	It's a nonsmoking floor too.
3970	3974	Maybe you could go down to the lobby.
3974	3976	Why don't you have me arrested?
3978	3980	I mean it.
3980	3984	I am a dangerous, criminal person.
3986	3989	I do bad things to honest people.
3991	3994	You can make a citizen's arrest. I wouldn't struggle.
3994	3996	It'd be like getting AI Capone on tax evasion.
4005	4007	Can I help you, miss?
4012	4015	Do you smoke, Richard?
4015	4018	Yes, I do, but--
4018	4020	It's a nonsmoking floor.
4023	4025	But you know what?
4047	4052	You know, my grandmother always said...
4054	4057	''This too shall pass.''
4061	4062	Thanks, Richard.
4088	4091	l want you to quit this shit.
4091	4092	It'll kill you.
4097	4098	What happened?
4101	4104	It's over. She denied it.
4104	4107	She said I was crazy and paranoid.
4107	4110	A bad combination.
4110	4111	There's a big...
4111	4115	brunch tomorrow morning at her parents' house.
4115	4118	She said, ''How could I call it oft?
4120	4122	What am I supposed to tell everyone?''
4124	4126	It's for the best. It really is.
4127	4129	She was right.
4131	4133	I am crazy...
4136	4138	to tall for someone I hardly knew.
4143	4145	I'm so glad you're here.
4152	4156	Have you still got that ring?
4167	4170	I tried it on, and it won't come off.
4208	4213	Why don't we take a walk or have some food sent up?
4215	4218	I just want to be alone.
4218	4220	Is that okay?
4220	4221	Sure.
4225	4230	Maybe I'll go back to New York for awhile and hang with you.
4230	4234	Eric will understand. Or we could go somewhere...
4234	4236	if you want.
4237	4240	''If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento--''
4242	4243	I've never been to Texas.
4293	4294	''Brown''
4313	4315	You what?
4337	4339	- Can I try that? - Sure.
4350	4352	- Excuse me. - Good Luck.
4355	4358	So this is your basic call-off-the-wedding party?
4358	4361	I came here to confront everybody. I won't slink away like some coward.
4361	4364	Besides, she hasn't told anyone. l don't know what I'm supposed to do.
4364	4368	There is a wedding at 6:00.
4375	4380	Have you changed your mind? Do you want to marry Kimmy?
4384	4387	I made a decision. It's over.
4389	4391	I'll go tell them.
4393	4397	First, do you think she's all right?
4398	4400	could you check on her for me?
4404	4407	These are the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen.
4411	4412	How is he?
4415	4418	He's sort of wondering...
4418	4421	why you haven't told your parents that the wedding's oft.
4423	4427	I don't know. I'm still hoping for a miracle, I suppose.
4427	4430	How could he think that my father and I would do such a thing?
4430	4433	I only minored in psych, you understand, but...
4435	4438	maybe Michael couldn't commit to this marriage...
4438	4441	so he created...
4441	4442	a delusion...
4442	4445	produced an unconscious, psychosomatic...
4445	4447	manifestation of--
4450	4452	I'm better with food.
4454	4459	You're Michael. You're in a fancy French restaurant.
4459	4462	You order...
4462	4464	crème brulee for dessert.
4465	4468	It's beautiful. It's sweet.
4468	4472	It's irritatingly perfect.
4472	4475	Suddenly, Michael realizes...
4475	4477	he doesn't want crème brulee.
4477	4482	- He wants something else. - What does he want?
4485	4487	- Jell-O. - ''Jell-O''?
4489	4493	- Why Jell-O? - He's comfortable with Jell-O.
4493	4496	Jell-O makes him comfortable.
4496	4498	I realize compared to crème brulee...
4498	4501	it's Jell-O, but maybe that's what he needs.
4503	4505	I could be Jell-O.
4507	4509	Crème brulee can never be Jell-O.
4509	4512	You could never be Jell-O.
4512	4515	- I have to be Jell-O. - You'll never be Jell-O.
4515	4521	Tell your parents. lf you're waiting for that ''do you take this man'' part...
4521	4523	- it's considered poor form. - I love him.
4524	4526	Whatever delusions I drove Michael to...
4526	4528	there's truth at the heart of it.
4528	4532	I want him to work for my father.
4532	4535	I want to stay in school, and I want a life of my own.
4536	4540	Please, tell him it's my fault and I love him.
4541	4544	You're the only person that I trust.
4550	4552	- I'll be right back. - Thank you.
4565	4568	How is she?
4568	4571	- Knock it off! - Yes, sir!
4573	4575	- I asked you-- - She admits that it's her fault.
4575	4578	Totally, completely, inexcusably her fault.
4581	4583	Do you think she still loves me?
4587	4590	Love is a strong word...
4590	4593	and I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified--
4593	4597	I guess I wouldn't be totally oft base it I said that, in her way...
4597	4600	she does possess strong feelings--
4606	4608	Sure, she does.
4609	4611	She's crazy about you.
4611	4615	You fill up my senses
4616	4619	Like a night in the forest
4621	4626	Like the mountains in springtime
4626	4629	Like a walk in the rain
4629	4631	Tell her I'll marry her at 6:00...
4632	4634	it she'll still have me.
4636	4638	Please.
4640	4644	Like a sleepy blue ocean
4644	4647	I'll be right back.
4652	4657	Come love me again
4668	4670	What did he say?
4676	4677	He said...
4680	4682	''Marry me.''
4687	4690	Thank God you were here.
4690	4692	I got so contused.
4692	4694	It happens.
4695	4696	Got a minute?
4698	4700	What's up?
4712	4715	I have to say this quick or I'll just have this massive coronary...
4715	4718	and then you'll never hear it, and you have to.
4718	4723	This is, by far, the dumbest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
4723	4728	So dumb, in fact, that I can't. But I'm gonna.
4728	4730	What's wrong?
4738	4741	I love you. I've loved you for nine years.
4741	4746	I've just been too arrogant and scared to realize it.
4746	4748	Now I'm just scared.
4748	4752	I realize this comes at a very inopportune time...
4752	4756	but I really have this gigantic favor to ask of you.
4758	4761	Choose me. Marry me.
4761	4764	Let me make you happy.
4765	4768	That sounds like three favors, doesn't it?
4768	4769	But--
4809	4812	- Lovely together. - Aren't they?
4816	4820	That's our maid of honor. She's from New York.
4834	4839	''Floral Design/Special Events'' Michael, wait!
4839	4841	Please! You'll never catch her!
4844	4846	Doesn't anybody leave their car unlocked?
4846	4849	Nobody trusts anybody anymore?
4849	4851	A good Samaritan.
4851	4854	''Auto Memory Storing'' There's just
4854	4856	Too little of
4856	4858	What the world needs now ''Bakery''
4858	4859	Come back here!
4859	4863	''Shy tendrils of russet pleasure...
4863	4867	began their unbidden journey.
4868	4869	She moaned.
4869	4874	The tonnage of years of anguish, sacrifice, mingling with--''
4874	4876	It is not going well !
4876	4880	This is what comes of telling the truth or even part of it!
4880	4884	- Getting what you deserve isn't fair. - Where are you?
4884	4888	I have stolen a bread van, and I'm chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!
4888	4891	This is all your fault! I told him the truth !
4891	4893	I said that I loved him, and I kissed him.
4893	4895	- This is what's happened! - Jules, a question.
4895	4899	When you kissed Michael, did he kiss you back?
4899	4901	What do you mean? We were lip to lip!
4901	4905	Was there anything there leading you to believe this chase will end happily?
4906	4908	That's beside the point. We were interrupted.
4908	4911	- Who interrupted you? - Kimmy! She ruined everything!
4911	4913	And Michael started chasing her before he could answer me.
4913	4915	Michael's chasing Kimmy?
4915	4917	You're chasing Michael?
4917	4920	Who's chasing you? Nobody. Get it?
4920	4921	There's your answer: Kimmy.
4921	4924	Jules, you are not the one!
4924	4928	Now, for God's sake, the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.
4928	4931	You have a small, but distinct, window of opportunity to do the right thing.
4950	4952	''Exit'' ''Canal St.''
4965	4966	all aboard!
4973	4974	Excuse me.
5033	5036	I have a confession to make.
5036	5038	Another confession.
5043	5048	Besides that I love you, this is even worse.
5055	5059	The e-mall that Walter sent to your boss--
5063	5065	I wrote that.
5068	5071	I'm the bad guy.
5072	5074	Are you crazy?
5074	5077	Are you completely insane?
5078	5082	l mean, Jules, how could you do that?
5083	5087	It wasn't supposed to get sent.
5087	5090	I just wanted you to get mad at Kimmy.
5093	5094	God.
5097	5101	I have done nothing but underhanded, despicable...
5101	5105	not even terribly imaginative things since I got here.
5113	5118	I was just trying to win you...
5119	5122	to win you back.
5123	5125	But that doesn't excuse any of it.
5127	5128	I'm pond scum.
5131	5132	Lower, actually.
5132	5137	I'm like the fungus that feeds on pond scum.
5137	5138	Lower.
5141	5144	The pus that infects the mucus...
5144	5148	that cruds up the fungus that feeds on the pond scum.
5156	5158	On the other hand...
5161	5163	thank you...
5165	5167	for loving me that much.
5168	5170	That way...
5170	5171	it's pretty flattering.
5173	5176	Except it makes me fungus.
5177	5181	That part I knew.
5191	5192	God.
5196	5199	I'm glad you didn't get on that train.
5201	5204	I came here looking for her.
5206	5210	- Why would she be here? - This is where I proposed.
5214	5218	l had to cover a game in Milwaukee, and she saw me off.
5218	5221	The train was starting to leave and...
5223	5226	I jumped up on the step and I held the handle...
5227	5230	and without...
5230	5233	a thought in my head, I just shouted, ''Marry me.''
5236	5241	The train was pulling out, and she just suddenly screamed, ''Yes!''
5244	5245	Just once.
5247	5249	And blew me a kiss.
5261	5263	It would've been a nice wedding.
5266	5269	You can't believe that you've lost her.
5269	5274	You will find her, and you'll look into her eyes and see all that love.
5274	5278	I just hope that it's soon. Or else I'd hate to be you at 6:00.
5278	5280	Just wait.
5280	5282	We'll split up.
5282	5286	You will go to every romantic place the two of you have...
5286	5291	and I will go someplace brilliant, and we'll find her.
5291	5294	We will find her.
5297	5300	Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
5300	5302	it’s Jules. Have you gotten a call from Kimmy?
5302	5305	She slipped out, the little monkey, during the commotion.
5305	5307	''Commotion''?
5307	5312	My sister was licking an ice sculpture, and her tongue froze right to it.
5312	5314	And that's a commotion?
5314	5316	It's a sculpture of the David.
5316	5318	So Kimmy would be--
5318	5321	She's probably with Michael doing the nasty.
5321	5324	Either that or crying in her nachos down at Comiskey Park.
5324	5326	- Excuse me? - I had this crank call...
5326	5329	from some guy who says he saw her in the luxury box.
5329	5332	- Right. - What would a bride be doing--
5332	5334	Can you bring my dress to the church?
5334	5336	I have to pick something up for the ceremony.
5336	5339	Don't forget to shave now.
5341	5343	Here we go. Here's the hair dryer.
5343	5345	There we go.
5345	5349	It's going to be okay. Please, no pictures.
5353	5354	''Federal Express''
5367	5370	I know you're in here. The guard saw you come in.
5370	5372	Just leave me alone, you bitch!
5379	5382	Who the hell do you think you are?
5382	5384	- Cat fight! - You came here...
5384	5388	pretending to be my friend, and I made you my maid of honor!
5388	5392	Who asked you to do that? You knew me what, eight minutes?
5392	5395	Michael trusted you, so I trusted you.
5395	5398	You wanted to keep me close. You didn't trust me for a second.
5398	5401	- I was right! - of course you were right.
5401	5404	- But that's not my fault. - You kissed him!
5404	5406	- At my parents' house! - That's cold.
5406	5408	On my wedding day!
5408	5409	- Bitch. - Tramp.
5409	5411	Shut up!
5411	5414	Now I love this man, and there is no way...
5414	5419	I'm going to give him up to some two-faced, big-haired food critic!
5423	5426	all right. Okay, all right!
5426	5427	I kissed him.
5429	5432	I tried to steal him.
5436	5438	I lost.
5443	5448	He doesn't love me. He loves you.
5455	5458	I haven't done much that I'm proud of the last three days.
5462	5465	I'd like to take you to the church...
5465	5468	so you can walk down that aisle...
5468	5471	and marry the man of our dreams.
5472	5475	Because he sure wants to marry you.
5588	5593	So raise our glasses and wish Mike and Kim every happiness...
5593	5595	for a long and happy life together...
5597	5600	filled with happiness.
5603	5606	- I guess that's it. - To the bride and groom.
5613	5616	Now let's hear from the maid of honor, the lovely Julianne.
5626	5629	I had the strangest dream.
5631	5635	I dreamt that some psychopath was trying to break the two of you up.
5641	5646	Luckily, I woke up and I see...
5647	5651	that the world is just as it Should be...
5655	5657	for my best friend...
5659	5661	has won the best woman.
5671	5674	I didn't get you a gift.
5676	5677	However, this is on loan...
5677	5681	However, this is on loan...
5683	5686	until you two find your song.
5691	5694	Someday
5696	5699	When I'm awfully low
5700	5703	When the world is cold
5705	5708	l will feel a glow
5708	5714	Just thinking of you
5714	5718	And the way you look
5719	5721	Tonight
5722	5727	Oh, but you're lovely
5729	5732	With your smile so warm
5735	5738	And your cheeks so soft
5739	5743	There is nothing for me
5743	5747	But to love you
5749	5752	Just the way you look
5753	5755	Tonight
5767	5770	- It's mine! - I don't think so!
5774	5776	I got it!
5805	5807	Bye.
5855	5857	Hey, gorgeous, having a good time?
5857	5860	Not particularly, but I did what I came to do.
5860	5863	What? You split them up?
5863	5865	No, I said good-bye.
5865	5867	Good girl. I'm proud of you.
5867	5870	Be prouder still if you were dancing.
5870	5872	I have big plans for dancing.
5872	5876	Just give me 30, 35 years.
5876	5878	The misery...
5878	5879	the exquisite tragedy.
5879	5882	The Susan Hayward of it all.
5882	5886	l can picture you there sitting alone at your table in your lavender gown.
5886	5887	Did I tell you my gown was Lavender?
5887	5890	Hair swept up. Haven't touched your cake.
5890	5895	Probably drumming your fingernails on the white linen tablecloth...
5895	5897	the way you do when you're really feeling down.
5897	5900	Perhaps looking at those nails thinking: ''I should've stopped...
5900	5904	my evil plotting to have that manicure, but it's too late now. "
5904	5908	I didn't tell you my dress was lavender.
5908	5910	Suddenly, a familiar song.
5910	5913	The moment I wake up
5915	5918	And you're off your chair in one, exquisite movement...
5921	5924	wondering, searching, sniffing the wind...
5924	5926	like a dapple deer.
5926	5929	Has God heard your little prayer?
5929	5931	Will Cinderella dance again?
5931	5935	And then, suddenly, the crowds part...
5937	5939	and there he is:
5940	5943	sleek, stylish...
5943	5946	radiant with charisma.
5946	5949	Bizarrely, he's on the telephone.
5949	5951	But then, so are you.
5954	5956	And he comes towards you...
5957	5959	the moves of a jungle cat.
5960	5963	Although you quite correctly sense that he is...
5964	5966	...
5966	5969	like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are...
5971	5974	you think, what the hell...
5976	5978	life goes on.
5978	5981	Maybe there won't be marriage.
5981	5983	Maybe there won't be sex.
5985	5988	But, by God, there'll be dancing.
6007	6009	Bond. Jane Bond.
