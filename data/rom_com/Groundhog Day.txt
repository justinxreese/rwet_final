59	60	Somebody asked me:
60	64	"Phil, if you could be anywhere,where would you be?"
64	67	I said to him,"Probably right here...
67	70	Elko, Nevada".Our nation's high at 79 today.
70	73	In California, they'll havewarm weather tomorrow...
73	76	gang wars and someoverpriced real estate.
76	79	In the Pacific Northwest,they'll have some...
79	81	very, very tall trees.
81	83	Clear across the Rockiesand Great Plains.
84	86	But look out, here comes trouble.
88	89	Oh, boy!
90	92	Front coming our way!Look out!
92	96	What will that mean to us?One of these big blue things!
96	100	This cold, frigid arctic air,this big mass out of the north.
101	104	It'll meet up with all thismoisture out of the Gulf.
104	107	They'll mix at high altitudesand cause snow.
107	112	It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.It'll push off and hit Altoona.
113	114	Close call!
114	116	Let's look at the five-day.
116	119	As you can see, nothing to betoo scared about.
120	123	Bundle up warm, but you canleave your galoshes at home.
123	126	I won't be here at 10:00.Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.
126	131	I'll be in Punxsutawney for ourcountry's oldest Groundhog Festival.
131	134	According to the legend,tomorrow, February 2nd...
135	137	if the groundhog wakesand sees his shadow...
138	140	we've got six more weeksof winter.
140	141	Sounds like fun.
141	145	You must really enjoy it.This is your third year in a row.
145	146	Four, Nan.

189	191	Rita thinks it'd bea great idea...
192	195	to stay for other events.You'll get incredible footage.
195	198	The people and the fun.The excitement!
198	201	You haven't worked with her yet.She's really nice.
201	204	I think she'll bea really good producer.
205	207	You guys are going to have fun.
209	214	She's fun. But not my kind of fun.I'll be here for the 5:00.
276	278	Can you keep a secret, Larry?
278	280	I'm probably leaving PBH.
281	283	So this will be the last time...
284	285	we do the Groundhog together.
286	289	What's wrong withthe Groundhog Festival?
289	290	In San Diego...
290	294	I covered the swallows returningto Capistrano for six years.
295	299	Someone will see me interviewa groundhog and think I have no future.
299	301	I think it's a nice story.
301	304	He comes out.He looks around.
304	306	He wrinkles up his nose.
306	310	He sees his shadow or not.It's nice! People like it!
310	313	You are new, aren't you?
314	316	People like blood sausage too.
316	317	People are morons!
318	320	Nice attitude.
320	324	Look in the mirror and see how youlook when you do that groundhog thing.
325	326	For me? Once?
326	330	He comes out, and there helooks at his little shadow.
331	333	Want some blood sausage?I have some
333	335	I like blood sausage.
394	396	Rita, I can't stay here.
397	399	Prima donna.

830	833	They pull the little rat out,talk to him.

1698	1700	You said it was goingto hit Altoona.
1701	1703	I know that's what I said.
1704	1706	I think you need help.
1707	1710	That's what I've been saying.I need help.
1711	1713	No spots.
1713	1715	No clots, no tumours.
1715	1717	No lesions.
1717	1719	No aneurisms.
1719	1720	At least none that I can see.
1721	1725	If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.
1725	1727	I can't go into Pittsburgh.
1727	1731	- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?- I told you, there's a blizzard.
1731	1732	Right. The blizzard!
1733	1735	You know what you may need,Mr. Connors?
1736	1737	A biopsy.
1738	1740	A psychiatrist.
1741	1744	That's an unusual problem...
1744	1745	Mr. Connors.
1747	1752	Most of my work is with couples,families. I have an alcoholic now.
1754	1756	You went to college, right?
1756	1758	It wasn't veterinarypsychology, was it?
1758	1761	Didn't you take a course thatcovered this stuff?
1762	1764	Sort of, I guess.
1766	1768	Abnormal psychology.
1768	1770	So...
1771	1772	what do I do?
1773	1775	We should meet again.
1775	1777	How's tomorrow for you?
1780	1782	Is that not good?
1792	1795	I was in the Virgin Islands once.
1795	1797	I met a girl.
1798	1799	We ate lobster.
1799	1801	Drank piòa coladas.
1801	1804	At sunset, we made lovelike sea otters.
1808	1810	That was a pretty good day.
1810	1812	Why couldn't I get that day...
1812	1814	over...
1814	1816	and over and over?
1816	1820	Some guys would lookat this glass and say:
1820	1822	"That glass is half empty".
1822	1826	Other guys would say,"That glass is half full".
1826	1829	I peg you as a "glass is half empty"kind of guy. Right?
1831	1835	What would you do if you werestuck in one place...
1835	1839	and every day was exactly the same,and nothing you did mattered?
1842	1844	That about sums it up for me.
1852	1853	Good luck.
1853	1855	I'll drop you off.
1857	1859	This thing sticks a little bit.
1859	1861	You got to jiggle it
1861	1863	Come on up here, pal.
1863	1866	Give me your keys, pal.Give me the keys.
1866	1869	Friends don't let friends drive, right?Stand up here.
1869	1872	Take a deep breath. You feel okay?
1872	1874	You're all right.
1880	1883	You want to throw up hereor in the car?
1883	1886	I think, both.
1897	1899	I don't think I should drive.
1899	1901	I don't either.
1901	1902	Watch your head.
1903	1906	Watch your knees.Don't break anything.
1906	1908	Let's not forget seat belts.
1910	1913	Who else could go for someflapjacks right now?
1919	1920	Let me ask you a question.
1921	1921	Shoot.
1923	1925	What if there were no tomorrow?
1925	1929	No tomorrow? That means there'd beno consequences...
1929	1931	no hangovers.
1931	1933	We could do whatever we wanted!
1935	1936	That's true.
1936	1939	We could do whatever we want.
1945	1948	If we wanted to hit mailboxeswe could let Ralph drive!
1955	1957	They want you to stop.
1957	1958	Hang on!
1964	1966	It's the same thingyour whole life.
1966	1969	"Clean up your room! Stand upstraight! Pick up your feet!
1970	1971	Take it like a man!
1971	1973	Be nice to your sister!
1974	1976	Don't mix beer and wine, ever!
1978	1980	Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"
1982	1983	That's one I agree with.
1993	1995	I don't know, Gus.
1995	1998	Sometimes I think you just have to...
1998	2001	take the big chances.
2001	2003	This is the police! Pull over now!
2004	2007	We're talking in here!
2012	2014	I bet he swerves first.
2028	2031	I'm not going to live bytheir rules anymore!
2031	2033	I noticed that.
2033	2036	You make choicesand you live with them.
2051	2052	My knee!
2054	2056	Let me handle this.
2059	2062	Three cheeseburgers,two large fries...
2062	2064	two chocolate shakesand one large Coke.
2064	2066	And some flapjacks!
2066	2068	Too early for flapjacks?
2082	2083	Yes!
2084	2086	Rise and shine, campers!
2086	2089	Don't forget your booties!It's cold out there today!
2089	2091	It's coId every day.
2091	2094	What is this, Miami Beach?Not hardly!

2100	2102	I'd love some of your coffee.
2103	2104	- I hope- Flurries moving in later...
2105	2107	but the blizzard's going to hitoutside of town.
2107	2108	Mrs. Lancaster?
2108	2110	Was anybody looking for mehere this morning?
2111	2114	Perhaps a state official?Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?
2114	2117	No, no one like that!Will there be?
2117	2119	Apparently not.
2121	2125	Will you hold my room for me?I'm staying an extra day.
2130	2132	Catch you tomorrow, pops.
2138	2140	- Phil Connors!- Ned?
2171	2175	I like to see a man of advancing yearsthrow caution to the wind.
2175	2177	It's inspiring, in a way.
2178	2181	My years are not advancingas fast as you think.
2181	2182	More coffee?
2183	2184	Keep it coming.
2184	2185	Sure thing.
2187	2190	Just put that anywhere, pal!
2190	2191	Good save!
2193	2197	Don't you worry about cholesterol,lung cancer, love handles?
2199	2201	I don't worry anymore.
2202	2204	What makes you special?Everybody worries.
2204	2207	That's exactly what makes meso special.
2207	2209	I don't even have to floss.
2219	2220	What?
2222	2225	"The wretch, concentred all in self"
2226	2228	"Living, shall forfeit fair renown"
2228	2231	"And doubly dying, shall go down"
2231	2234	"To the vile dust from whence he sprung"
2235	2236	"Unwept..."
2236	2239	"...unhonoured and unsung"
2239	2241	Sir Walter Scott.
2245	2246	You don't like poetry?
2247	2248	I love poetry!
2248	2251	I just thought that was Willard Scott.I was confused.
2252	2254	You think I act like thisbecause I'm egocentric?
2255	2258	You are egocentric.It's your defining characteristic.
2260	2264	You guys ready? We better go,to stay ahead of the weather.
2264	2265	Thanks, Larry.
2265	2267	Would you like a doggie bag?
2268	2269	I'll stay and finish.
2269	2272	I thought you hated this town.
2272	2274	It's beginning to grow on me.
2275	2276	Larry, quit staring.
2277	2280	- These are excellent.- Bon appétit
2290	2292	You see the groundhogthis morning?

2435	2437	On the contrary, Nancy...
2438	2441	I love you.I've always loved you.
2442	2444	This is going to seem sudden but...

2457	2459	- Nancy.- Whatever.
2464	2466	A gust of wind.

2566	2568	I've seen it over 100 times.
2568	2569	Phil!

2712	2713	Me also.
2714	2718	He's got a good body but doesn'thave to look in the mirror often.
2718	2723	I have a great body, and sometimesI go months without looking.
2726	2729	He's kind, sensitive and gentle.
2730	2731	He's not afraid to cry.
2732	2734	This is a manwe're talking about, right?
2734	2739	He likes animals, children,and he'll change poopy diapers.
2740	2742	Does he have to use the word "poopy"?
2744	2747	He plays an instrument,and he loves his mother.
2748	2751	I am really close on this one.

2908	2911	- Some white chocolate?- Yuck, don't make me sick.
2911	2912	No white chocolate.
2912	2915	There is somethingso familiar about this.
2915	2918	Do you ever have déjá vu?
2918	2920	Didn't you just ask me that?
2924	2928	People place too muchemphasis on their careers.
2928	2931	I wish we could all livein the mountains.
2931	2934	That's where I see myselfin five years.
2934	2935	How about you?
2935	2938	I agree. I just liketo go with the flow.
2938	2940	See where it leads me.
2940	2942	Well, it's led you here.
2944	2948	It's about a million milesfrom where I started in college.
2948	2951	You weren't in broadcastingor journalism?
2953	2957	Believe it or not, I studied19th-century French poetry.
2957	2959	What a waste of time!
2959	2962	I mean, for someone elsethat'd be a total waste.
2962	2964	So bold of you to choose that.
2964	2968	It's incredible.You must be a very strong person.
2970	2973	People place too muchemphasis on their careers.
2973	2978	I wish we could alllive in the mountains.
2978	2980	That's where I see myselfin five years.
2981	2982	How about you?
2982	2986	I agree. I like to gowith the flow, see what happens.
2986	2988	Well, it's gotten you here.
2989	2992	It's a million milesfrom where I started in college.
2992	2996	You weren't in broadcastingor journalism or anything like that?
2997	3001	Believe it or not, I studied19th-century French poetry.
3018	3019	You speak French!
3025	3028	I haven't done this since I was a kid.
3028	3030	Me neither. It's fun!
3030	3031	Clean fun.
3034	3038	I hope one day I can do thiswith my own children.
3041	3043	Where'd you get that?
3043	3046	Well, I went overto the snowman shop.
3048	3049	Hey, an assassin!
3050	3051	I'll protect you!
3052	3055	I shall die for you.You shall not take her!
3055	3056	Find cover!
3059	3061	I'm getting some good ones.
3061	3064	That's a boy! Good try.
3064	3066	Help me!
3122	3123	What?
3123	3127	I'm just amazed,and I'm not easily amazed.
3127	3129	About what?
3129	3132	How you can start a day with onekind of expectation...
3132	3134	and end upso completely different.
3136	3139	Do you like the waythis day is turning out?
3139	3141	I like it very much.
3142	3145	It's a perfect day.You couldn't plan a day like this.
3145	3147	Well, you can.
3147	3150	It just takes an awful lot of work.
3150	3152	Come in.I want to show you something.
3153	3155	- I don't think I should.- I agree.
3155	3159	That's why I want to show you one thing,then kick you right out.
3168	3170	It's just lovely.
3180	3183	Would you like to sitand stare at the fake fire?
3188	3190	It's a really wonderful room.
3190	3192	It is now.
3199	3201	I don't think we should do this.
3202	3203	I don't either.
3206	3209	On second thought,I think we should.
3209	3213	It's the perfect endto a perfect day.
3213	3216	Well, it's a little fast for me.
3216	3218	Me too.
3218	3220	Maybe I should go.
3221	3223	Where would you go?
3223	3224	Why?
3224	3227	We've got a perfect fire.
3227	3230	I've got some French poetry here.Baudelaire....
3232	3233	I will read to you.
3234	3238	I've got some ice cream onthe windowsill. Hold on a minute.
3244	3245	Rocky road.
3245	3246	I love rocky road.
3247	3249	Yeah, I thought so.

3251	3255	No, really, I'm tired.We can see each other tomorrow.
3255	3259	No, tonight.It's got to be tonight.
3259	3262	No, Phil, really.
3263	3266	Just stay for a while andif you like it, stay longer.
3266	3268	And if you like that, stay longer.
3268	3270	Let's not spoil it, okay?
3271	3273	I don't want to spoil it either.
3273	3276	You know I can't stay with you.
3276	3279	Why not? I love you.

3284	3288	- You don't even know me.- I know you.
3289	3292	Oh, no. I can't believeI fell for this!

3295	3296	No, it hasn't.
3297	3299	And I hate fudge. Yuck!
3300	3302	No white chocolate, no fudge.
3302	3306	What are you doing?Are you making some kind of list?
3306	3309	Did you call my friendsand ask them what I like?
3309	3313	- Is this what love is for you?- This is real. This is love.
3313	3314	Stop saying that!
3315	3317	You must be crazy.
3317	3321	I could never love you becauseyou'll never love anyone but yourself.
3321	3325	I don't even like myself.Give me another chance.
3326	3329	That's for making mecare about you.
3336	3338	I haven't done thissince I was a kid.
3339	3340	It's fun!
3340	3344	And good, clean fun too.That's what's missing in the world.

3463	3464	Okay, campers.
3465	3467	Rise and shine.

3516	3518	This is pitifuI.
3518	3520	A thousand peopIe...
3520	3523	freezing their butts off,waiting to worship a rat.
3523	3525	What a hype.
3526	3530	They used to pull the hog out,and they used to eat it.
3530	3533	You're hypocrites! All of you!
3535	3537	You got a problem, Larry?
3538	3539	Untie your tongue.
3539	3542	Come here and talk.Am I upsetting you...
3542	3543	princess?
3543	3545	You want a predictionabout the weather?
3545	3548	You're asking the wrong Phil.
3548	3551	I'll give you a winter prediction.
3551	3553	It's going to be cold.
3553	3556	It's going to be gray.
3556	3561	And it's going to last youfor the rest of your life.
3595	3599	Once again the eyes of the nationhave turned here...
3600	3603	to this tiny villagein Western Pennsylvania.
3603	3606	There is no way that this winter...
3606	3609	is ever going to end...
3609	3613	as long as this groundhogkeeps seeing his shadow.
3614	3615	I don't see any other way out.
3616	3618	He's got to be stopped.
3620	3621	And I have to stop it.
3624	3624	Real good, Phil.
3625	3626	Real good.
3627	3629	He's out of his gourd.
3634	3637	I'm worried. There's somethingreally wrong with Phil.
3637	3640	There's a lot of thingswrong with Phil.
3642	3643	Hi, Phil.
3644	3646	I've come to the end of me.
3646	3648	There's no way out now.
3650	3653	Just remember, we hada beautiful day together once.
3657	3658	All right, little fellow.
3658	3662	Good job. He just smiled at me!Did you see that?
3662	3663	I believe he did.
3664	3667	Okay, little fellow.There you go.
3669	3671	Hi, there. Something I cando you for?
3674	3676	Hey! What are you doing?
3681	3683	Get the word out.Somebody kidnapped Phil!
3683	3684	We are going after him!
3691	3694	Why would anybody steal a groundhog?
3694	3696	I could think of reasons.
3696	3697	Pervert.
3723	3725	He must have just snapped!
3725	3726	This ought to be good.
3729	3730	What is he doing?
3730	3732	What can he be thinking?
3732	3734	Not bad for a quadruped.
3734	3738	Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.Side of your eye.
3744	3746	That's it.
3746	3749	Hey, they're chasing us!Come on, make it fun.
3757	3758	Don't drive angry.
3759	3760	Don't drive angry.

3783	3784	We got him now!
3804	3805	What is he doing?
3805	3806	I don't know.
3810	3813	If you got to shoot,don't hit the groundhog.
3818	3820	Mustn't keep them waiting.
3823	3824	It's showtime.
3831	3832	On me in three...
3834	3835	two...
3837	3838	one.
3852	3853	Phil!
3855	3856	He might be okay.
3861	3864	Well, no. Probably not now.
3879	3881	Nuts.
3888	3891	Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
3892	3894	Would you like...
3895	3896	some toast?
3914	3917	Oh, my God!
3949	3950	That's him.
3954	3957	He was a really, really great guy.
3957	3959	I really, really liked him...
3959	3960	a lot.
3968	3970	I'm sorry?What was that again?
3970	3973	- I'm a god.- You're God?
3973	3976	I'm a god. I'm not the god,I don't think.
3977	3979	Because you survived a car wreck?
3979	3980	You folks ready to order?
3981	3984	I didn't just survive a wreck.I wasn't just blown up.
3984	3987	I have been stabbed,shot, poisoned...
3987	3990	frozen, hung, electrocutedand burned.
3991	3992	Oh, really.
3992	3996	Every morning I wake up without ascratch, not a dent in the fender.
3997	3998	I am an immortal.
3998	4001	Special today is blueberry waffles.
4001	4003	Why are you telling me this?
4003	4006	Because I want you to believe in me.
4006	4007	You are not a god.
4007	4011	Take my word. It's 12 yearsof Catholic school talking.
4011	4013	I can come back if you're not ready.
4013	4015	How do you know I'm not a god?
4016	4017	Please.
4017	4019	- How do you know?- It's not possible.
4020	4021	I'll come back.

4029	4033	She's worked here since she was 17.She wants to see Paris...
4033	4034	before she dies.
4035	4036	Boy, would I!

4045	4046	Lovely ring.
4046	4051	Bill's been a waiter three years,since he left Penn State to work.
4051	4054	He likes the town,paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.
4054	4055	I am.
4056	4059	Gus hates it here,wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.
4059	4062	I could've retiredon half pay after 20 years.
4062	4064	Excuse me. Is this a trick?
4064	4068	Maybe the real God uses tricks.Maybe he's not omnipotent...
4068	4070	he just knows everything.
4070	4072	- Who's that?- Tom.
4072	4074	He worked in the coal minetill it closed.
4074	4075	- And her?- Alice.

4085	4087	- It's true.- How do you know this?
4087	4089	I told you, I know everything.
4089	4092	In five seconds, a waiterwill drop a tray.
4092	4095	- Five, four, three, two, one.- This is nuts.
4097	4100	- Okay?- Okay, that's enough.
4101	4103	What about me?Do you know me too?
4103	4107	I know all about you. You hopefor more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.
4108	4110	Well, everyone knows that.
4110	4113	You like boats but not the ocean.
4113	4117	You go to a lake in the summerwith your family.
4117	4121	There's a dock and a boathousewith boards missing from the roof...
4122	4124	and a place you used tocrawl underneath to be alone.
4125	4128	You're a sucker forFrench poetry and rhinestones.
4129	4130	You're very generous.
4131	4133	You're kind to strangersand children.
4134	4137	When you stand in the snowyou look like an angel.
4137	4139	How are you doing this?
4140	4143	I told you. I wake up every day.
4143	4145	Right here.
4145	4148	Right in Punxsutawney.And it's always February 2nd.
4149	4152	And there's nothingI can do about it.
4152	4155	If you still can't believe me, listen:
4156	4158	In 10 seconds...
4158	4162	Larry is going to comeand take you away from me.
4162	4164	But you can't let him.
4165	4168	Please believe me.You've got to believe me.
4173	4177	You guys ready? We better go,to stay ahead of the weather.
4178	4179	What's that?
4180	4182	"to stay ahead of the weather".
4188	4192	Maybe it really is happening.How else could you know so much?
4192	4194	There is no way.I'm not that smart.
4196	4198	Maybe I shouldspend the day with you...
4198	4201	as an objective witness,just to see what happens.
4202	4204	This sounds like a science project.
4205	4207	Concentrate.
4207	4209	You got to want it.
4209	4211	You got to want it, Rita.
4212	4215	Come on. It's morein the wrist than the fingers.
4224	4226	Be the hat. Come on, go.
4226	4229	- It'd take me a year to get good.- Six months.
4229	4232	Four to five hours a day,and you'd be an expert.
4233	4236	- Is this what you do with eternity?- Now you know.
4238	4240	That's not the worst part.
4240	4242	What's the worst part?
4242	4244	The worst part is that...
4244	4247	tomorrow you'll haveforgotten all about this...
4247	4249	and you'll treat melike a jerk again.
4250	4252	I am a jerk.
4252	4254	No, you're not.
4254	4258	It doesn't make any difference.I've killed myself so many times...
4259	4260	I don't even exist anymore.
4261	4264	Sometimes I wish I hada thousand lifetimes.
4264	4267	I don't know.Maybe it's not a curse.
4268	4270	It just dependson how you look at it.
4272	4274	Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!
4277	4280	I want you to know it's beena really nice day for me.
4281	4282	Me too.
4282	4283	And maybe...
4283	4287	if it's not too boring,we can do it again sometime.
4287	4289	I hope so.
4301	4303	You're still here?
4305	4308	I thought you were supposedto disappear. Or I was.
4308	4310	Not until 6.
4311	4312	You rat!
4312	4314	I never said midnight.
4314	4317	You knew I was waiting for midnight.
4318	4319	Are you going to leave?
4323	4324	Good.
4335	4336	I'm sorry.
4338	4340	It's all right.You can fall asleep.
4341	4343	I promise I won't touch you.
4344	4345	Much.
4347	4349	It's all right. I'm not tired.
4350	4352	What were you saying?
4353	4357	I think the last thingthat you heard was...
4357	4360	only God could make a tree.
4360	4361	Really?
4399	4401	What I wanted to say was...
4403	4405	I think you are the kindest...
4405	4408	sweetest, prettiest person...
4408	4410	I've ever met in my life.
4412	4414	I've never seen anyone...
4415	4417	that's nicer to peoplethan you are.
4430	4432	And the first time I saw you...
4433	4436	something happened to me.
4437	4439	I never told you...
4442	4445	but I knew I wantedto hold you...
4445	4447	as hard as I could.
4460	4462	I don't deserve someone like you.
4466	4468	But if I ever could...
4469	4471	I swear I would love you...
4472	4474	for the rest of my life.
4479	4480	Did you say something?
4486	4488	Good night, Rita.
4489	4491	Good night, Phil.
4515	4519	Campers, rise and shine!Don't forget your booties
4519	4522	- It's cold out there!- It's cold every day

4572	4574	Pastry, Larry?Take your pick.
4575	4577	Thanks. Raspberry. Great.
4578	4581	I talked with Buster Green,the head groundhog honcho.
4581	4584	He said if we set up herewe'll get a better shot.
4585	4587	- What do you think?- Sounds good.
4587	4588	Larry?
4590	4592	Yeah. Let's go for it.
4592	4593	Good work, Phil.
4594	4597	Maybe we'll get lucky.Let me give you a hand.
4598	4601	No, no. You got your coffee.I'll get it.
4603	4604	We never talk.Do you have kids?
4639	4641	I'd like a piano lesson.
4641	4645	I'm with a student. But if youwant to come back tomorrow
4646	4649	I kind of want to get started.I can give you $1,000.
4652	4652	Come on in.
4672	4674	Morning!Off to see the groundhog?
4674	4676	Buon giorno, signore!
4677	4680	Think it'll be an early spring?
4680	4682	"Winter, slumbering in the open air"
4683	4684	"Wears on his smiling face..."
4684	4687	"a dream of spring"
4687	4688	Ciao!
4689	4690	Ciao!
4729	4730	How does she look?
4730	4731	Great.
4732	4733	Thank you.
4733	4736	Did you know he could ice sculpt?
4750	4754	Not bad. You saythis is your first lesson?
4754	4758	Yes, but my fatherwas a piano mover, so....
4764	4768	- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.- Ned Ryerson.
4770	4772	I have missed you so much.
4777	4780	I don't know where you're headed,but can you call in sick?
4784	4786	I got to get going.
4787	4789	It's good to see you, Phil.
4807	4808	Hello, father.
4809	4811	Let's get you someplace warm.
4812	4814	Remember me?
4821	4822	You brought the old man in?
4823	4824	How is he?
4824	4826	He just passed away.
4828	4831	- What did he die of?- He was just old.
4831	4833	It was just his time.
4836	4839	- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.- Sir!
4839	4841	You can't come in here.
4841	4844	Sir, this is a restricted area.
4853	4855	Where's the chart?
4855	4857	Sometimes people just die.
4858	4860	Not today.
4872	4874	Gets hard down there at the bottom.
4877	4879	Here you go.
4879	4880	Thank you.
4884	4885	Come on, dad.
4886	4887	Come on, pop.
4889	4891	Come on. Come on, breathe.
4891	4894	Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!
4919	4922	When Chekhov saw the long winter...
4923	4926	he saw a winter bleakand dark and bereft of hope.
4926	4931	Yet we know winter is justanother step in the cycle of life.
4931	4935	But standing here amongthe people of Punxsutawney...
4935	4938	and basking in the warmthof their hearths and hearts...
4939	4941	I couldn't imagine a better fate...
4941	4944	than a long and lustrous winter.
4945	4947	From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.
4948	4949	So long.
4951	4953	Nice speech. Very nice.
4953	4954	Thank you.
4955	4959	- How was that for you two?- My man, you touched me.
4959	4960	- Thanks, Larry.- Thank you.
4962	4963	I got to go.
4964	4968	That was surprising.I didn't know you were so versatile.
4969	4970	I surprise myself sometimes.
4971	4973	Would you like a cup of coffee?
4973	4977	I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?I've got some errands.
4980	4982	Errands? What errands?
4983	4985	I thought we were going back.
5002	5005	What do you say?What do you say?
5005	5008	You little brat.You have never thanked me!
5009	5011	I'll see you tomorrow...
5011	5012	maybe.
5020	5022	You totaled it.
5022	5026	- It's only a flat tire.- What are we going to do?
5028	5031	- It's an earthquake!- It's not an earthquake.
5031	5032	What is it?
5036	5038	Thank you, young man.
5039	5042	It's nothing.I had the tire and the jack.
5042	5044	Just be comfortable.It'll be a minute.
5045	5046	Who is that?
5046	5049	He must be from the motor club.
