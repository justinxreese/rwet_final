257	260	I suppose you think that's very funny, Harold.
264	266	- Hello? Fée? - Yeah.
266	271	Darling, be a dear and cancel my appointment with René this afternoon.
275	279	I know he'll be furious but I've had such a fright today
279	283	and with guests coming this evening... Oh, would you?
285	288	Tell him I promise to be in on Tuesday.
288	291	Thank you, Fée, you're a darling. Yes.
292	294	Bye. Bye.
299	302	Dinner at eight, Harold.
302	305	And do try and be a little more vivacious.
317	320	Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd.
320	324	I remember once in Paris, he just stepped out for cigarettes
324	327	and the next thing I knew he was arrested
327	329	for floating nude down the Seine!
329	333	Experimenting in river currents with rubber water wings!
333	335	Mauve ones.
336	341	That cost quite a bit of influence et d'argent to hush up, I can tell you!
342	344	Harold, dear, don't play with your food.
345	347	What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
350	352	I have a sore throat.
354	357	Now, directly after dinner, I want you to go straight to bed.
358	361	Harold's always been a delicate child.
361	366	Even as a baby, he seemed prone to every possible kind of illness.
366	368	Harold, dear, eat up your beets.
369	372	I remember in Tokyo, I had to call the embassy for a doctor...
395	397	Oh, my God!
399	401	This is too much.
403	406	I can't stand much more of this.
407	409	I can't take any more.
410	412	Oh, my God!
414	417	Oh, God!
420	424	That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminating.
424	428	There seems to be a definite pattern emerging
428	433	and of course this pattern, once isolated, can be coped with.
433	437	Recognise the problem and you're halfway on the road to its...
437	439	its solution.
439	444	Tell me, Harold, what do you do for fun?
444	449	What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment from the others?
449	451	What do you find fulfilling?
451	456	What gives you that special... satisfaction?
464	466	I go to funerals.
525	529	"Thou dost prepare for me a table in the sight of my adversaries,
529	531	"Thou dost anoint my head with oil,
531	533	"my chalice overflows.
533	537	"Kindness and grace shall follow me all the days of my life
537	541	"and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days.
542	545	"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,
545	547	"the world and they who dwell therein.
547	551	"For He has established it upon the waters and set it upon the rivers.
551	553	"Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord
553	556	"or who shall stand in His holy place?
556	559	"The innocent of hand and the pure of heart
559	562	"who has not turned his mind to vanity
562	565	"nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour,
565	568	"he shall receive the blessing from the Lord
568	571	"and a reward from God, his Saviour.
571	574	"This is the generation of those who seek him..."
609	610	Harold?
612	617	Why you purchased that monstrosity I have no idea.
617	621	You can have any car you want but that ugly horror is an eyesore
621	623	and an embarrassment.
623	625	Really, it is time you settled down
625	629	and stopped flitting away your talents on these amateur theatrics,
629	631	these little divertissements,
632	635	no matter how psychologically purging they may be.
636	638	I don't know what to do.
642	644	Go and have a talk with your Uncle Victor.
644	647	Perhaps he can fathom you.
647	651	After all, he was General MacArthur's right-hand man.
657	659	What do you say, Harold?
661	663	It's a great life.
663	668	There's action, adventure, advising and you'll see the war first hand.
670	673	And there are plenty of slant-eyed girls.
673	675	It'll make a man out of you, Harold.
675	680	You'll travel the world, put on a uniform and take on a man's job.
681	684	You'll walk tall with a glint in your eye and a spring in your step
684	688	and a knowledge in your heart that you are working for peace
690	691	and are serving your country,
692	694	just like Nathan Hale.
695	700	That's what this country needs, more Nathan Hale.
709	714	I think I can see a little Nathan Hale... in you.
799	802	Tell me, Harold, how many of these...
802	804	suicides have you performed?
805	808	An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
808	810	Well, just give me a rough estimate.
810	812	A rough estimate?
813	817	I'd say... 15.
817	820	- 15? - That's a rough estimate.
820	823	Were they all done for your mother's benefit?
823	826	No, no - I would not say benefit.
827	832	Harold, I only have a few minutes and I want to inform you of my decision.
835	839	You have led a very carefree, idle, happy life up to the present,
839	841	the life of a child.
841	844	But it is time now to put away childish things
844	846	and take on adult responsibilities.
846	849	We'd all like to sail through life with no thought of tomorrow
849	851	but that cannot be.
851	856	We have our duties, our obligations, our principles.
856	860	In short, Harold, I think it is time for you to get married.
873	876	Let's pray to the Lord, King of Glory,
876	880	that he may bless and deliver the souls of all faithful departed
880	883	from the pain of hell and the bottomless pit.
883	887	Deliver them from the lion's mouth and the darkness therein
887	892	and rather, bring them to the blessing of light,
892	894	holy life, eternal rest.
898	902	"Oh, Lord, do not bring yourself into trial
902	904	"for no man...
905	910	"becomes holy in your sight unless you grant forgiveness of his sins.
910	912	"I implore you, therefore,
912	916	"do not let the verdict of your judgement go against him...
918	922	"Rather, by the help of your Grace,
922	925	"may he escape the sentence which he deserves
925	928	"for during his earthly life he would sign the seal of the Holy Trinity.
929	932	"You, who live and reign forever and ever.
934	935	"Amen."
939	941	- Like some liquorice? - No, thank you.
941	942	You're welcome.
949	951	Did you know him?
951	953	- No. - Me neither.
953	956	I heard he's 80 years old. I'll be 80 next week.
957	959	A good time to move on, don't you think?
959	961	I don't know.
963	969	I mean, 75 is too early but at 85, you're just marking time.
969	972	You may as well look over the horizon.
981	983	I'll never understand this mania for black.
983	986	Nobody sends black flowers, do they?
986	990	Black flowers are dead flowers, who sends dead flowers to a funeral?
990	992	It's absurd!
1010	1013	- What is your name? - Harold, Harold Chasen.
1013	1018	How do you do? I'm Dame Marjorie Chardin but you may call me Maude.
1018	1020	- Nice to meet you. - Thank you.
1020	1023	I think we're gonna be great friends.
1023	1025	Can I give you a lift, Harold?
1025	1027	No, thank you. I have my own car.
1027	1030	Well, I must be off. We shall have to meet again.
1037	1038	Tell me, do you dance?
1038	1041	- Pardon me? - Do you sing and dance?
1042	1045	- No. - No, I thought not.
1059	1061	That woman! She took my car!
1064	1068	I have here the forms sent out by the National Computer Dating Service.
1068	1071	They screen out the fat and the ugly,
1071	1074	so it is obviously a firm of high standards.
1074	1076	First, here is the personality interview,
1076	1079	which you are to fill out and return.
1079	1081	Now then, are you ready, Harold?
1081	1084	Here is the first question.
1084	1087	"Are you uncomfortable meeting new people?"
1087	1090	Well, I think that's a yes, don't you agree?
1090	1094	"Should sex education be taught outside the home?"
1094	1098	I would say no, wouldn't you, Harold? Yeah, we'll give a D there.
1098	1102	"Should women run for president of the United States?"
1102	1105	I don't see why not. Absolutely yes.
1105	1109	"Do you remember jokes and take pleasure in relating them to others?"
1109	1114	Well, you don't do that, do you, Harold? Absolutely not.
1114	1119	"Do you often get the feeling that perhaps life isn't worth living?"
1119	1123	What do you think, Harold? A? B? We'll put C - not sure.
1124	1128	"Is the subject of sex being overexploited by our mass media?"
1129	1132	Well, that would have to be yes, wouldn't it?
1132	1135	"Is it difficult for you to accept criticism?"
1135	1137	No. We'll mark D.
1137	1141	"Do you sometimes have headaches or backaches after a difficult day?"
1141	1144	Yes, I do indeed.
1144	1146	"Do you go to sleep easily?"
1146	1148	I'd say so.
1148	1151	"Do you believe in capital punishment for murder?"
1151	1153	Yes, I do indeed.
1153	1157	"In your opinion, are social affairs usually a waste of time?"
1157	1158	Heavens, no!
1159	1162	"Can God influence our lives?"
1162	1165	Yes, absolutely yes.
1165	1168	"Does your personal religion or philosophy
1168	1170	"include a life after death?"
1170	1174	Yes, indeed. That's absolutely.
1175	1178	"Did you enjoy life when you were a child?"
1178	1182	Yes, you were a wonderful baby, Harold.
1182	1186	"Do you think the sexual revolution has gone too far?"
1186	1189	It certainly has.
1189	1193	"Do you find the idea of wife-swapping distasteful?"
1193	1196	I even find the question distasteful.
1196	1197	"Do you..."
1201	1203	Harold, please!
1203	1207	"Do you have ups and downs without obvious reason?"
1208	1210	That's you, Harold!
1253	1258	"Dearest brothers, let us faithfully and lovingly remember our brother
1258	1262	"whom God has taken to Himself from the trials of this world.
1263	1268	"God have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy."
1268	1270	Our Father, who art in heaven,
1270	1272	hallowed be Thy name.
1272	1276	Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
1276	1280	Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
1280	1283	as we forgive those who trespass against us.
1283	1287	Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
1287	1289	Amen.
1345	1348	My boy, excuse me.
1348	1352	One moment, please. Who was that old lady waving to you earlier?
1353	1356	Hello, Harold. Can I give you a lift?
1356	1360	There you are, madam. Were you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
1360	1363	- The one with the St Christopher? - Yes.
1363	1366	Then I suppose it was me! Get in, Harold.
1366	1369	Were you also the one who painted the saint?
1369	1372	Yes! How did you like that?
1372	1375	- Well, I didn't. - Don't be too discouraged.
1375	1378	For aesthetic appreciation, always a little time.
1386	1389	What a delight it is, Harold, to bump into you again.
1389	1393	I knew we were gonna be good friends the moment I saw you.
1393	1395	- You go to funerals often? - Yeah.
1395	1398	So do I. They're such fun, aren't they?
1398	1400	It's all change, all revolving.
1400	1403	Burials and births, all linked.
1403	1405	The great circle of life.
1408	1412	This thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
1412	1414	- Yeah. - It's a new experience for me.
1418	1420	Well done, hearse!
1420	1422	Shall I take you home, Harold?
1422	1424	This is my car.
1424	1426	- Your hearse? - Yearse!
1432	1435	Then you shall take me home.
1448	1452	So, just before he left for the monastery in Tibet,
1452	1454	Big Sweeney gave me his keys.
1454	1458	I had to make changes for the new model, not as many as you'd think.
1458	1463	Once you have you the basic set, it's only a question of variation.
1463	1466	You hop in any car you want and just drive off?
1466	1470	Not any car. I like a variety. I'm always looking for a new experience.
1471	1477	Maybe... Nevertheless, I think you're upsetting people.
1477	1479	I don't know if that's right.
1480	1484	If people get upset cos they feel they have a hold on some things,
1484	1488	I'm just acting as a gentle reminder, here today, gone tomorrow.
1488	1492	So don't get attached to things. Now, with that in mind,
1492	1494	I'm not against collecting stuff.
1494	1498	I've collected quite a lot of stuff in my time.
1500	1502	This is all memorabilia
1502	1506	but it's incidental, not integral, if you know what I mean.
1507	1508	The birds.
1508	1511	I love them so much.
1511	1514	They are the only wildlife I get to see any more.
1514	1517	Ah, me, free as a bird.
1519	1523	At one time, I used to break into pet shops to liberate the canaries
1524	1527	but I decided that was an idea way before its time.
1527	1531	Zoos are full, prisons are overflowing.
1531	1537	Oh, my, how the world still... dearly loves a cage.
1538	1539	Please sit down, Harold.
1539	1543	I'll put the kettle on. We'll have a nice, hot cup of tea.
1543	1545	Thank you but I really have to go.
1545	1549	But it's oat straw tea! You've not had that, have you?
1549	1551	- No. - Well, then.
1551	1554	I really do have to go. I have an appointment.
1554	1556	I really can't miss it.
1557	1558	At the dentist?
1560	1561	Kind of.
1562	1565	Then, you'll just have to come back and visit.
1565	1568	- All right. - My door's always open.
1568	1571	- All right. - Promise?
1571	1572	I promise.
1581	1584	I asked, do you have any friends?
1584	1587	- No. - None at all?
1587	1589	No.
1589	1591	Maybe one.
1591	1594	Would you care to talk about this friend?
1594	1595	No!
1595	1599	You are an interesting case but this reluctance is detrimental
1599	1601	to the psychoanalytical process.
1601	1604	Do you understand?
1607	1609	Very well.
1609	1613	Your mother tells me that she's arranging several dates for you
1613	1615	with some young ladies.
1615	1617	How do you feel about that?
1623	1626	- Hello, I'm Candy Gulf. - How do you do? I'm Mrs Chasen.
1627	1631	Do come in. Harold's in the garden but he'll be here in a moment.
1631	1633	Shall we sit down?
1633	1635	There's Harold.
1643	1646	- He seems very nice. - Thank you.
1646	1649	- You are at the university? - Yes, I am.
1649	1653	- What are you studying? - Poli Sci with a minor in Home Ec.
1653	1654	Poli Sci?
1655	1658	Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
1658	1661	Is Harold interested in what's going on?
1661	1664	I just think it's such a super thing to study
1664	1667	and I can always fall back on my Home Ec.
1667	1669	- That's good planning. - Yes.
1669	1673	Tell me, are you a regular with this Computer Club?
1673	1676	Heavens, no! I don't have to worry about dates.
1678	1682	Some of the girls in my sorority decided that someone ought to try it
1682	1685	so we drew straws and I lost!
1686	1689	But I'm looking forward to meeting Harold.
1689	1694	I should mention, Candy, Harold does have his little eccentric moments.
1694	1698	That's all right. I have a brother who's a real cut-up, too.
1699	1701	I will never forget the time,
1701	1704	we had this old TV set with no parts in it,
1705	1709	Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a whole newscast
1709	1711	before the entire family!
1711	1713	Must have been very funny.
1718	1720	Yes, dear, here is Harold now.
1720	1722	Harold, this is Candy.
1722	1725	Candy's just been telling us a funny story about...
1727	1728	Walter Cronkite.
1777	1778	Excuse me.
1780	1783	- I beg your pardon. - What do you want?
1783	1786	I'm sorry, I was looking for Maude.
1796	1798	How about some ginger pie?
1799	1802	- Fine. Thank you. - I'll heat some up.
1805	1808	My, Harold, I'm glad to see you again.
1808	1810	Do you often model for Glaucus?
1810	1812	Heavens, no! I don't have the time
1813	1814	but I like to keep in practice
1814	1818	and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed
1819	1821	as to the contours of the female form.
1822	1826	- Do you disapprove? - Me? No, of course not.
1828	1831	Really? Do you think it's wrong?
1842	1843	No.
1843	1845	Heavens! I'm glad you said that.
1845	1850	I wanna show you my painting. This is The Rape Of Rome.
1851	1855	Over in the corner is Leda And The Swan,
1855	1857	self-portrait,
1857	1859	and over here is my favourite.
1861	1868	It's titled... Rainbow With Egg Underneath And An Elephant.
1869	1871	- Do you like it? - Yeah, very much.
1872	1876	I then became infatuated with these, my odorifics.
1876	1881	Give the nose a treat! A kind of a... olfactory banquet.
1881	1885	So, I began on the easiest - roast beef, old books, mown grass
1885	1887	and Mexican farmyard.
1888	1892	Here's one you'll like, Snowfall on 42nd Street.
1892	1894	I'll put it on.
1895	1899	Now, you hold onto this, I'll pump it up.
1902	1906	Now, hold it up there. That's right. What do you smell?
1911	1912	Subways?
1919	1921	Perfume?
1927	1929	Cigarettes!
1936	1939	- Snow. - Sn!
1940	1941	It goes on and on.
1943	1944	It's just great.
1944	1949	But... then I decided to switch to the tactile.
1951	1955	- What do you think? - I like this.
1955	1959	No, no, really get close and reach in and feel.
1960	1962	There's my kettle.
1963	1965	Well... stroke...
1966	1970	palm... caress... explore.
2011	2014	Here we are. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
2017	2019	Excuse the mismatched saucers.
2021	2024	- This is a new experience for me. - Wonderful!
2024	2029	Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out.
2029	2030	Doesn't last forever.
2030	2032	You look as if you could.
2034	2037	Did I tell you I'll be 80 on Saturday?
2037	2038	You don't look 80.
2038	2043	That's the influence of the right food, exercises and breathing.
2043	2045	Greet the dawn with a breath of fire.
2058	2061	There's no question, my body's giving out.
2061	2065	I'm well into autumn. It's all gonna be over after Saturday.
2065	2069	Tell me about yourself. What do you do when you aren't at funerals?
2078	2082	Yes, there is definitely a certain attraction.
2095	2098	I ask you though, Harold, is it enough?
2100	2102	What do you mean?
2110	2112	I like to watch things grow.
2120	2125	They... grow and bloom and... fade and die
2125	2127	and change into something else.
2130	2131	Life!
2132	2137	I should like to change into a sunflower most of all.
2137	2140	They're so tall and simple.
2140	2142	What flower would you like to be?
2143	2144	I don't know.
2146	2149	- One of these maybe. - Why do you say that?
2151	2154	- Because they're all alike. - But they're not.
2154	2159	Look, see, some are smaller, some are fatter.
2159	2162	Some grow to the left, some to the right.
2162	2164	Some, even, have lost some petals.
2164	2167	All kinds of observable differences.
2168	2173	You see, Harold, I feel that much of the world's sorrow
2173	2175	comes from people who are this...
2177	2181	yet, allow themselves to be treated as that.
2257	2259	Power steering.
2289	2293	That little tree is in trouble. Come on.
2293	2294	Look at it.
2295	2298	It's suffocating. It's the smog.
2299	2302	People can live with it but trees, it gives them asthma.
2302	2306	They can't breathe. The leaves! They're turning brown.
2306	2310	Harold, we have got to do something about this life.
2310	2313	- What? - We'll transplant it to the forest.
2313	2315	- You can't do that. - Why not?
2315	2319	- This is public property. - Well, exactly.
2320	2322	Well, we'll need tools.
2322	2325	You're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
2326	2328	Wait a minute.
2329	2331	Police. Come.
2335	2338	Good afternoon, Officer. A bit of trouble here?
2338	2341	Yes, ma'am. Someone had trouble parking.
2341	2345	Tell me, that car over there, is that parked all right?
2345	2347	Yes, ma'am, that's fine.
2347	2352	Thank you so much. You might turn the radio off - saves the battery.
2381	2383	A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
2383	2387	- Thank you, I don't drink. - It's all right, it's organic.
2387	2390	- Thanks. - It has no nutritional value
2390	2394	but consistency is not really a human trait.
2394	2396	What is that up there?
2396	2398	That's my umbrella.
2398	2402	That's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America.
2402	2406	It used to be my defence on picket lines and rallies
2406	2407	and political meetings,
2407	2411	being dragged off by the police and attacked by thugs.
2411	2413	What were you fighting for?
2415	2418	Big issue. Liberty, rights, justice.
2418	2421	Kings died, kingdoms fell.
2421	2424	I don't regret the kingdom.
2424	2429	What sense in borders and nations and patriotism?
2431	2433	But I miss the kings.
2434	2438	When I was a little girl, I was taken to the palace in Vienna
2438	2440	to a garden party.
2440	2445	I can still see the sun shining, the parasols,
2445	2448	the flashing uniforms of the young officers.
2448	2451	I thought then that I would marry a soldier.
2453	2456	Later on, Frederick would chide me about it.
2458	2460	He was so serious.
2462	2465	A doctor at the university...
2465	2466	and in the government.
2479	2481	But that was all before.
2491	2492	So...
2496	2498	you don't use the umbrella any more?
2502	2504	No more revolts?
2509	2511	Yes. Every day...
2513	2518	but... I don't need a defence any more, I embrace.
2518	2521	Still fighting for the big issues
2521	2525	but now in my small, individual way.
2527	2529	Shall we have a song?
2529	2532	- I don't play... - Come on, I'll show you.
2532	2533	No...
2578	2580	Harold, join in.
2638	2641	That was fun! Let's play something together!
2642	2645	- I don't play anything. - Nothing?!
2647	2650	Dear me! Everybody should be able to make some music.
2650	2653	That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
2653	2656	There has to be something.
2656	2659	Now, let me see...
2661	2663	Hold onto this. What is this?
2663	2665	Just a second, there we are.
2665	2668	You take... This is the one. Take that.
2668	2672	Just be impulsive, be fanciful. Let the music flow out of you.
2672	2674	You gotta make some chords.
2674	2677	Put your finger on the second fret there
2677	2680	and this one on the third. Then this one here.
2697	2698	Harold dear.
2700	2701	There you are!
2704	2706	I have a little surprise for you.
2707	2709	It's a present.
2713	2715	Come along.
2736	2738	There!
2738	2740	Isn't it darling?
2741	2745	I had them take away that monstrous thing of yours and send this.
2745	2748	So much more appropriate, don't you think?
2750	2751	One thing more, Harold.
2752	2754	I telephoned your second computer date
2754	2756	and she seems a very nice, quiet girl.
2757	2760	Cute little thing, isn't it? I like it very much.
2806	2808	Your licence, lady.
2808	2811	I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
2813	2817	- How long you been driving, lady? - About 45 minutes, I guess.
2817	2822	We were hoping to start sooner but it's rather hard to find a truck.
2822	2824	Is this your truck?
2825	2827	No, I just took it.
2827	2830	- You took it? - Yes, I have to plant my tree.
2830	2833	Well, it's not mine really
2833	2837	but we would like to get it into soil as soon as possible.
2838	2840	Let me get this straight, you...
2840	2844	All right, then, we'll be off. Nice chatting with you.
2849	2851	- He was very nice. - Yeah.
2865	2868	- I think he's following us. - Is he?!
2869	2872	The police, always wanting to play games.
2885	2886	Ma'am!
2921	2923	Is the little tree all right?
2925	2927	Yeah, fine.
2927	2929	Terrific!
2938	2940	There.
2941	2944	I love the feel of soil, don't you?
2944	2946	And the smell.
2948	2950	It's the earth...
2951	2955	The earth is my body, my head is in the stars.
2956	2958	Who said that?
2959	2961	I don't know.
2962	2963	I suppose I did.
2964	2966	Poor baby.
2967	2971	Isn't it wonderful?! All around us, living things.
3034	3036	All right, out, lady.
3037	3040	- Come on. - Hello. Have we met before?
3040	3042	None of that, lady. Out.
3042	3046	It must have been your brother. There is a family resemblance.
3048	3052	Buddy, get out of the car. Just stand over there, lady.
3052	3054	Get out, buster!
3054	3056	You're in a lot of trouble, lady.
3056	3059	I have you for several offences, including...
3059	3061	possession of a stolen vehicle,
3061	3065	resisting arrest and possession of a stolen tree. Where is it?
3065	3067	- We planted it. - You planted it.
3067	3069	- Is this your shovel? - No.
3071	3073	Possession of a stolen shovel.
3073	3076	Don't get officious. You're not yourself when you are.
3076	3078	That's the curse of a government job.
3084	3086	Lady.
3088	3090	Are you gonna take a lot of time with this?
3090	3094	- Lady, please. Just quiet, please. - Cos if you are...
3099	3101	Grab the shovel, Harold.
3112	3114	Lady! Stop or I'll have to shoot.
3139	3141	I sure am picking up on vices.
3142	3145	Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral.
3145	3149	You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality.
3149	3152	If you apply that to life,
3152	3155	then you're bound to live it fully.
3161	3163	I haven't lived.
3166	3168	I've died a few times.
3168	3170	What was that?
3171	3173	Well...
3175	3179	The first time was when I was at boarding school,
3179	3181	in the chemistry lab.
3181	3186	I was in there cleaning it up so I decided I'd do a little experiment.
3186	3190	You know, so I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up,
3190	3192	it was very scientific!
3195	3197	There was this massive explosion.
3197	3201	It knocked me down, blew out a huge hole in the floor.
3201	3205	There was boards and bricks and flames leaping up.
3205	3209	I figured, you know... time to leave.
3209	3212	My career in school was over.
3213	3216	So... I went home.
3216	3221	My mother was a giving a party so I went up the back stairs to my room.
3222	3226	Turned out the light and... I got this funny feeling.
3228	3232	The doorbell rang. I went out to the banister
3232	3235	and these two policemen came in,
3235	3241	found my mother... and... told her
3241	3243	that I was killed in the fire.
3244	3247	She put one hand up to her forehead,
3247	3251	the other one she reached out as if groping for support,
3251	3254	and with this long sigh,
3255	3258	she collapsed in their arms.
3286	3290	I decided right then that I enjoyed being dead.
3292	3296	I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead
3296	3298	but they're not dead really.
3298	3302	They're just backing away from life.
3303	3308	Reach out and take a chance, get hurt even,
3308	3311	but play as well as you can.
3311	3314	Go team, go!
3314	3317	Gimme an L, gimme an I, gimme a V, gimme an E.
3317	3320	L-l-V-E, live.
3321	3325	Otherwise you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.
3335	3337	I like you, Maude.
3339	3341	I like you, Harold.
3375	3376	Harold is down at the garage.
3376	3379	He has a new car and he's just been tuning it up.
3379	3382	- He's very mechanical. - What kind of car is it?
3382	3384	It's a little Jaguar.
3387	3389	It looks like a hearse.
3390	3392	Very nice. You know, compact.
3392	3395	Edith, I'd like you to meet my son Harold.
3395	3396	Harold, this is Edith...
3397	3400	- Phern. - Phern. Very pleased to meet you.
3401	3405	I think you should go and wash up, dear. Join us in the drawing room.
3406	3408	And what do you do, my dear?
3408	3411	I'm a file clerk, Harrison Feed and Grain.
3411	3413	Well, what is it exactly that you do?
3414	3417	I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest.
3417	3418	How interesting.
3418	3422	We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Pataluma.
3422	3425	- So you can imagine... - Yes.
3427	3429	Here's Harold now.
3429	3431	Don't get up, dear.
3437	3439	Edith has been talking about her job.
3439	3441	I'm a file clerk.
3441	3443	Henderson Feed and Grain.
3443	3446	Harrison, Harrison Feed and Grain. It's at Hamilton and 4th.
3446	3448	I'm in charge of the invoices.
3449	3452	I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet.
3452	3455	She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
3455	3458	Well, not exactly the whole southwest,
3458	3460	although we do do a large business.
3460	3463	Barley was very big last week. 1,500...
3464	3465	bushels.
3485	3488	In view of your recent actions, Harold,
3488	3490	you have left me with no recourse
3490	3493	but to listen to your uncle's proposed solution.
3493	3498	Consequently, I have instructed him to induct you into the service,
3498	3500	and for your own good,
3500	3504	to take up active duty with the United States army.
3505	3509	And I hope they have more luck with you than I.
3510	3513	Maude, they're gonna draft me.
3513	3515	Well, don't go.
3515	3517	They'll put me in jail.
3517	3521	Well, historically, you'll be in very good company.
3525	3527	Maude, can you help me?
3527	3532	With your skill and my experience, I think we can come up with something.
3534	3537	Look on me as a father in this matter.
3537	3540	I know you have no desire to join the army
3540	3543	but once you're in, you'll love it. It's a great life.
3544	3548	Look at me - chauffeur, respect, money in the bank.
3549	3552	It has its drawbacks like anything else, I suppose,
3552	3557	but the army takes care of you and you've got a buddy for life.
3560	3563	Good idea coming out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
3563	3566	- Thank you, Uncle. - Call me sir.
3566	3570	That's the first thing you learn. An officer deserves your respect.
3570	3572	Yes, sir.
3573	3575	Let's examine the facts on it.
3576	3581	I say this country has been too harsh on its outright condemnation of war.
3581	3585	You can point to the many material advantages brought about
3585	3587	by a crisis and conflict policy.
3587	3590	Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen.
3590	3593	In wartime, the national suicide rate drops.
3593	3597	Is that a fact? Now, why in hell did we give up on the Germans?
3598	3601	Since the damn politicians chalked them up on our side,
3601	3605	the wars ever since have been a national disgrace.
3605	3606	Hell, look at history -
3606	3610	the two best wars we ever fought were against the Jerries.
3610	3613	I say get the Krauts on the other side where they belong.
3613	3618	Let's have an enemy worth killing and a war this country can support.
3618	3621	That's pretty strong stuff, sir.
3621	3625	Well, Harold, I've always been a man that speaks his piece.
3625	3629	Always hurt me. I'm not liked in Washington.
3629	3633	I know that... but I do have friends in high places.
3637	3639	They kept falling!
3639	3642	Joe falls back, a neat, red hole in his head.
3643	3646	Only one thing kept going through my mind.
3646	3651	Kill! Kill! For Joe and Mack and all the rest of the guys.
3651	3654	Kill! And then there was a blinding flash...
3658	3661	and I woke up on a stretcher.
3665	3667	"Did we hold?" I asked the medic.
3668	3670	"Yes, sir," he said...
3674	3677	and I slipped into unconsciousness.
3679	3680	Boy!
3682	3684	That's a terrific story, sir.
3685	3690	Well, you'll have stories like that to tell of your own some day.
3690	3692	- Do you think so, sir? - Sure you will.
3692	3696	Gee, I never dreamed it could be that exciting.
3696	3699	It's the most exciting thing in the world.
3699	3702	To pit your own life against another.
3702	3704	- Yes. - To kill.
3705	3707	The taste of blood in your mouth.
3707	3709	The moment of truth.
3710	3713	- Another man's life in your sights! - Yes!
3713	3717	- Will they really teach me to shoot? - Sure. A range of weapons.
3717	3720	- To use a bayonet? - Yes!
3720	3722	- How about hand-to-hand combat? - Yes.
3723	3725	To strangle someone, choke 'em,
3725	3727	squeeze out his life in your bare hands!
3727	3731	- You're getting carried away. - To slit his throat...
3731	3733	- I don't know. - See the blood spurt out.
3733	3735	- And souvenirs. - Souvenirs?
3735	3739	Of your kill. Eyes, ears, nose, scalp, privates.
3740	3744	What would be the chance of getting one of these?
3744	3747	- To think I could make my own! - That's disgusting.
3747	3750	- It certainly is. - Madam, who are you?
3750	3754	- I am petitioning for peace. - Parasite.
3754	3757	- I came here to speak. - Crazy parasite. Commie bastard.
3758	3762	Don't you talk to me like that, you foul-mouthed degenerate.
3762	3764	- Remember Nathan Hale. - Calm down.
3765	3768	- She's a commie pig... - Don't you advance on me!
3768	3770	You'll all end up like this.
3771	3773	- Just like this! - Filth. Filth!
3773	3776	Give me that. I'm gonna throw that in the sewer.
3777	3779	- Madam, please. - She took my head.
3779	3782	- Calm down, Harold. - She took my head!
3782	3784	I'll kill her! I'll kill her!
3784	3786	I'll kill her!
3787	3790	Give back the head, let's have no trouble. Harold!
3791	3793	Madam!
3793	3795	Damn you!
3797	3799	You took my head! You cow!
3799	3801	- I'll kill you! - Help!
3803	3806	I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
3808	3810	Harold, stop that.
3831	3833	What have you done?
3843	3845	Do you pray?
3846	3849	Pray? No, I communicate.
3851	3853	With God?
3853	3854	Life.
3859	3861	- This is real nice. - Yeah.
3861	3864	- Makes me want to do somersaults. - Why don't you?
3865	3867	I'd feel stupid.
3868	3872	Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves.
3872	3875	You can't let the world judge you too much.
3895	3898	Do you care to join me in a little cartwheel?
3900	3902	I feel more like yelling!
3969	3972	I had the most wonderful day today...
3972	3977	and... you're very beautiful.
3983	3985	You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
3994	3997	Shall I come and visit you tomorrow? Oh, I can't.
3997	4001	I have a luncheon date... with a girl.
4003	4007	I don't even know her. My mother arranged it.
4011	4013	Look!
4015	4019	Dreyfus once wrote from Devil's Island that he would see
4019	4021	the most glorious birds.
4021	4026	Many years later in Brittany, he realised they had only been seagulls.
4033	4036	For me, they will always be glorious birds.
4061	4065	I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of this meeting.
4065	4070	This is the last girl so this is your third and final chance.
4070	4072	And please try to be serious, Harold.
4072	4075	If not for your sake, at least for hers.
4075	4077	There she is.
4077	4080	Sunshine, I'd like you to meet Harold.
4080	4082	Harold, this is Sunshine Doré.
4082	4084	How do... How do you do?
4084	4086	I can't complain.
4087	4089	Sunshine is an actress, Harold.
4089	4092	- I like to think so. - Wonderful.
4092	4095	Why don't you two go down to the music room
4095	4097	and I'll follow with some drinks.
4097	4100	Or perhaps Starlight would like a cigarette.
4101	4103	- Sunshine! - Yes, of course.
4103	4105	Sunshine.
4123	4125	Would you like a cigarette?
4125	4128	No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
4128	4130	Is Sunshine your real name?
4130	4135	Well, actually it was the name of my drama teacher, Louis Sunshine.
4135	4137	Perhaps you've heard of him?
4137	4142	He was such an influence on the development of my instrument.
4142	4145	That means my body in theatre talk.
4146	4148	Doré is my real name.
4149	4152	Well, Dore, actually.
4152	4157	Oh, my! What a lovely place you have here.
4166	4168	Do you play?
4168	4173	No. I am learning the ban... The harmonica.
4174	4177	Is this your father?
4178	4180	No. It's my Uncle Victor.
4180	4185	He's in the army. I do so like the military, don't you?
4187	4190	What a wonderful collection of knives. May I see them?
4190	4192	No, don't touch. They're very old.
4192	4195	Do you enjoy knives?
4195	4196	Oh, yes!
4196	4201	You might find this one interesting. It's a Hara-Kiri blade.
4203	4205	What's Hara-Kiri?
4294	4296	That was marvellous!
4297	4300	It had the ring of truth.
4300	4305	I played Juliet in the Sunshine Playhouse.
4305	4307	Louis thought it was my best performance.
4310	4315	What's here? A cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4317	4322	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
4323	4326	O, happy dagger.
4327	4330	O, happy dagger,
4330	4334	this is thy sheath, there rest...
4334	4337	...and let me die...
4344	4346	I-I've...
4368	4370	That was your last date.
4405	4407	It wasn't very scary.
4407	4410	No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
4410	4414	Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
4470	4472	You sure have a way with people.
4473	4475	Well, they're my species.
4479	4481	Look at these stars.
4496	4497	Here.
4499	4500	A gift!
4506	4508	"Harold loves Maude"
4514	4516	And Maude loves Harold.
4520	4525	This is the nicest present that I've received in years.
4535	4538	So I'll always know where it is.
4594	4597	Could I speak with Fée, please?
4599	4603	Fée? Darling, I know René will be furious but...
4603	4606	If he knew what I had to put up with in the last few days.
4606	4608	- Mother. - Not now, dear.
4608	4610	Could you put me down for Monday?
4610	4613	- I'd like to talk to you. - I'm on the phone.
4613	4615	I'm getting married.
4615	4616	What did you say?
4618	4620	I'm getting married.
4622	4624	Hold the line, Fée.
4626	4628	To who?
4634	4639	I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold. A sunflower.
4645	4648	You can't be serious.
4671	4674	Your mother has spoken to me about your marriage plan
4674	4678	and although I have nothing against marriage,
4678	4682	I don't think this is quite... normal.
4682	4686	A very common neurosis, particularly in this society,
4686	4691	whereby the male child subconsciously wishes to sleep with his mother.
4692	4695	Of course, what puzzles me, Harold,
4695	4698	is that you want to sleep with your grandmother.
4698	4701	I would be remiss in my duty...
4701	4703	if I did not tell you...
4703	4705	that the idea of...
4708	4709	intercourse...
4712	4714	and the fact of your firm, young...
4716	4718	body...
4721	4722	co-mingling...
4724	4726	with the...
4726	4728	withered flesh...
4729	4732	sagging...
4732	4734	breasts...
4734	4736	and...
4736	4738	flabby...
4742	4744	buttocks...
4746	4748	makes me want...
4750	4751	to vomit.
4767	4769	It's... dazzling.
4800	4802	You've thought of everything,
4802	4804	and champagne.
4804	4806	It's all right, it's organic.
4814	4816	For you.
4820	4822	And...
4823	4825	after dinner...
4832	4834	one more little surprise...
4836	4839	that I hope will make you very happy.
4842	4844	I am happy.
4850	4854	I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
4857	4858	Farewell?
4858	4861	Yes, it's my 80th birthday.
4864	4869	Well, you're not going anywhere... are you?
4869	4873	Yes, dear. I took the tablets an hour ago.
4874	4876	I'll be gone by midnight.
4892	4894	What?!
4898	4902	What a fuss this is. So unnecessary.
4902	4905	Don't die, Maude, for Christ's sake.
4908	4911	Don't upset yourself so.
4912	4914	I love you.
4914	4916	I love you.
4918	4922	Harold... that's wonderful.
4924	4927	Go and love some more.
4932	4934	Never. Never.
