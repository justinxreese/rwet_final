127	132	I was sitting with my friend Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.
132	135	It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.
135	139	And this beautiful girl walked in, and I turned to Arthur
139	144	and I said "Arthur, you see that girl? I'm going to marry her."
144	147	And two weeks later we were married.
147	150	And it's over 50 years later,
150	153	and we're still married.
159	161	~ It's very clear
161	163	UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - 1977
163	166	~ Our love is here to stay
166	168	- I love you. - I love you.
168	172	~ Not for a year
172	176	~ But ever and a day
177	183	~ Oh, the radio and the telephone
183	186	~ And the movies that we know
187	190	~ May just be passing fancies...
201	204	Hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns.
205	208	- Harry, this is Sally Albright. - Nice to meet you.
208	211	- Wanna drive the first shift? - You're there already. You start.
211	214	Back's open.
214	217	- Call me. - I'll call you as soon as I get there.
217	221	- Call me from the road. - I'll call you before that.
221	224	- I love you. - I love you.
228	230	Sorry.
230	233	- I miss you already. I miss you already. - I miss you.
233	234	- Bye. - Bye.
234	238	~ In time, the Rockies may crumble
238	241	~ Gibraltar may tumble
241	243	~ They only made of clay
243	245	~ But
245	250	~ Our love is here to stay
251	256	I have it all figured out. It's an 18-hour trip, which becomes six shifts of three hours.
256	260	Or, alternatively, we could break it down by mileage.
260	264	There's a... There's a map on the visor
264	267	that I've marked to show the locations where we can change shifts.
268	269	Grape?
270	272	No. I don't like to eat between meals.
276	279	I'll roll down the window.
286	289	Why don't you tell me the story of your life?
291	295	- The story of my life? - We got 18 hours to kill before New York.
295	299	That won't even get us out of Chicago. Nothing's happened to me yet.
299	301	- So I'm going to New York. - So something'll happen?
301	303	- Yes. - Like what?
303	305	Like I'm going to journalism school.
305	309	So you can write about things that happen to other people.
309	312	- That's one way to look at it. - Suppose nothing happens.
312	316	Suppose you never meet anybody, you never become anything,
316	321	then you die and nobody notices for two weeks until the smell drifts into the hall.
324	327	- Amanda said you had a dark side. - That's what drew her to me.
327	330	- Your dark side? - Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?
330	334	I know, you probably dot your "i"s with little hearts.
334	336	I have just as much of a dark side as the next person.
336	340	Oh, really? When I buy a new book, I always read the last page first.
340	343	That way, if I die before I finish I know how it ends.
343	345	That, my friend, is a dark side.
345	350	That doesn't mean you're deep. I mean, yes, basically I'm a happy person.
350	352	- So am I. - I don't see anything wrong with that.
352	355	No, you're too busy being happy. Ever think about death?
356	358	- Yes. - Sure you do. A fleeting thought
358	361	that drifts in and out of the transom of your mind. I spend days.
361	363	And this makes you a better person?
363	367	Look, when the shit comes down, I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.
367	371	In the meantime, you're gonna ruin your whole life waiting for it.
378	381	- You're wrong. - I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.
381	384	- That's why he puts her on the plane. - She doesn't want to stay!
384	388	Of course she wants to stay! Wouldn't you rather be with Bogart than the other guy?
388	393	I don't wanna spend my life in Casablanca married to a man who runs a bar.
394	396	That probably sounds snobbish to you, but I don't.
396	399	- You'd rather be in a loveless marriage... - And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.
399	402	..than with the man you had the greatest sex of your life with,
402	405	just because he owns a bar and that is all he does?
405	407	Yes.
407	410	And so would any woman in her right mind. Women are practical,
410	415	even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she gets on the plane at the end of the movie.
418	420	I understand.
420	422	- What? What? - Nothing.
423	425	- What? - Forget about it.
425	427	- Forget about what? - It's not important.
427	429	No, just tell me.
430	433	Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.
433	435	- Two, please. - Right over there.
435	437	- Yes, I have. - No, you haven't.
437	441	It just so happens that I have had plenty of good sex.
458	460	With whom?
461	464	- What? - With whom did you have this great sex?
464	466	I'm not gonna tell you that!
467	469	Fine. Don't tell me.
473	477	- Shel Gordon. - Shel. Sheldon?
477	480	No. No, you did not have great sex with Sheldon.
480	483	- I did, too. - No, you didn't.
483	487	A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.
488	491	But humpin' is not Sheldon's strong suit. It's the name.
491	495	"Do it to me, Sheldon." "You're an animal, Sheldon." "Ride me, big Sheldon."
496	498	- It doesn't work. - Hi.
498	501	- What can I get you? - I'll have a number three.
502	506	The chef's salad with the oil and vinegar on the side. And the apple pie á la mode.
506	509	Chef and apple á la mode.
509	513	But I'd like the pie heated and I want the ice cream on the side.
513	517	I'd like strawberry, if you have it. If not, then whipped cream, but only if it's real.
518	519	If it's out of a can, nothing.
519	523	- Not even the pie? - No, just the pie, but then not heated.
529	532	- What? - Nothin'. Nothin'.
534	537	- How come you broke up with Sheldon? - How do you know we broke up?
538	543	If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me. You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.
543	546	First of all, I am not with you.
546	550	And second of all, it is none of your business why we broke up.
550	553	You're right, you're right. I don't wanna know.
556	560	Well, it was because he was jealous and I had these days-of-the-week underpants.
561	563	Sorry, I need a judge's ruling on this.
563	566	- Days-of-the-week underpants? - Yes.
566	569	They had days of the week on them and I thought they were funny.
569	573	Then one day Sheldon says to me "You never wear Sunday."
573	576	He's all suspicious. Where had I left Sunday?
576	578	And I told him and he didn't believe me.
578	581	- What? - They don't make Sunday.
581	584	- Why not? - Because of God.
589	593	OK, so 15 % of my share is 90.
593	596	$6.90.
598	600	Let's leave seven.
603	605	What?
606	608	Do I have something on my face?
610	612	You're a very attractive person.
614	615	Thank you.
615	617	Amanda never said how attractive you were.
617	620	Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.
620	624	I don't think it's a matter of opinion. Empirically, you are attractive.
626	628	Amanda is my friend.
628	629	So?
629	632	- So you're going with her. - So?
632	634	So you're coming on to me!
635	637	No, I wasn't.
638	639	What?
640	644	Can't a man say a woman is attractive without it being a come-on?
644	645	All right, all right.
645	650	Let's just say, just for the sake of argument, that it was a come-on.
650	654	What d'you want me to do about it? I take it back, OK? I take it back.
654	655	You can't take it back.
655	658	- Why not? - Because it's already out there.
658	661	What are we supposed to do? Call the cops, it's already out there!
662	664	Just let it lie.
664	669	- OK? - Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.
669	672	That's what I always say: "Let it lie."
672	674	Wanna spend the night in a motel?
674	676	- See? I didn't let it lie. - Harry.
676	678	I said I would, then I didn't.
678	680	- Harry! - What?
680	682	We are just going to be friends, OK?
682	685	Great! Friends! It's the best thing.
686	689	You realise that we could never be friends.
689	692	- Why not? - What I'm saying is,
692	695	and this is not a come-on in any way, shape or form,
695	699	is that men and women can't be friends, cos the sex part always gets in the way.
701	705	That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there is no sex involved.
705	706	- You don't. - I do.
706	708	- You don't. - I do!
708	709	You only think you do.
709	711	I have sex with them without my knowledge?
711	714	No, they all wanna have sex with you.
715	716	- They do not. - Do, too.
716	718	- They do not. - Do, too.
718	719	How do you know?
719	722	No man can be friends with a woman he finds attractive.
722	725	He always wants to have sex with her.
725	729	So you're saying a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive.
729	732	No, you pretty much wanna nail them, too.
734	736	What if they don't wanna have sex?
736	741	Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already out there, so the friendship is doomed.
742	745	- I guess we're not gonna be friends then. - Guess not.
745	747	That's too bad.
747	750	You were the only person that I knew in New York.
750	753	~ You say ee-ther, I say either
753	757	~ You say nee-ther and I say neither
757	759	~ Ee-ther, either
759	761	~ And nee-ther, neither
761	764	~ Let's call the whole thing off
764	768	~ Yes, you like potato and I like pot-ahto
768	772	~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto
772	774	~ Potato, pot-ahto
774	776	~ Tomato, tom-ahto
776	779	~ Let's call the whole thing off
787	790	- Thanks for the ride. - Yeah. It was interesting.
791	794	- It was nice knowing you. - Yeah.
802	806	- Well, have a nice life. - You, too.
806	810	~ You like potato and I like pot-ahto
810	813	~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto
814	815	~ Potato, pot-ahto
815	817	~ Tomato, tom-ahto
818	820	~ Let's call the whole thing off
823	827	- We fell in love in high school. - Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.
827	830	But then after our junior year his parents moved away.
830	834	- But I never forgot her. - He never forgot me.
834	837	No, her face was burned on my brain.
837	841	And it was 34 years later that I was walking down Broadway
841	843	and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.
843	845	We both looked at each other,
845	849	and it was just as though not a single day had gone by.
849	853	She was just as beautiful as she was at sixteen.
853	856	He was just the same.
856	858	He looked exactly the same.
863	866	FIVE YEARS LATER
889	892	Joe! I thought it was you. I thought it was you.
892	894	- Harry Burns. - Harry. How ya doin'?
894	897	- Good. How you doin'? - Fine. I'm doin' fine.
897	899	I was just walking by and I thought it was you.
899	901	Yeah, it was.
901	905	- You still with the DA's office? - No, I switched to the other side. You?
905	909	I work with a small firm. We do political consulting. Yeah, it's great.
911	914	Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.
914	917	Harry and I, we used to... We lived in the same building.
920	924	Well, listen, I got a plane to catch. It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.
931	935	Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove to New York with him five years ago
935	938	and it was the longest night of my life.
939	942	- What happened? - He made a pass at me. When I said no:
942	945	he was going with a girlfriend of mine...
946	949	Oh, God. I can't remember her name.
949	953	Don't get involved with me. I am 26 and can't remember the name of the girl
953	957	I was such good friends with I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.
957	959	- So what happened? - When?
959	962	When he made a pass, you said no...
962	964	I said we could just be friends.
965	970	And this part I remember. He said men and women could never really be friends.
970	972	Do you think that's true?
973	974	No.
974	977	Do you have any women friends, just friends?
978	979	No.
979	982	But I will get one if it's important to you.
984	986	Amanda Reese!
986	988	That was her name. Thank God.
988	992	I will miss you. I love you.
992	996	- You do? - Yes.
997	999	I love you.
1021	1024	- What would you like to drink? - Nothing, thanks.
1024	1026	- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix? - Yes.
1026	1031	No, wait. Here's what I want. Regular tomato juice, fill it up three quarters,
1031	1035	then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix - just a splash - and some lime on the side.
1036	1038	The University of Chicago, right?
1039	1042	- Yes. - Did you look this good at university?
1042	1045	- No. - Did we ever...?
1045	1047	No. No!
1048	1051	We drove from Chicago to New York together after graduation.
1052	1055	- Would you two like to sit together? - Great! Thank you.
1061	1063	You were a good friend of...
1064	1067	Amanda's. I can't believe you can't remember her name.
1067	1070	What do you mean? I can remember. Amanda Rice.
1070	1072	- Reese. - Reese, right. What happened to her?
1073	1075	- I have no idea. - You have no idea?!
1075	1079	You were friends. We didn't make it because you were such good friends.
1079	1081	- You went with her! - Was it worth it?
1081	1083	The sacrifice, for a friend you no longer see?
1083	1086	Harry, you might not believe this,
1086	1089	but I never considered not sleeping with you a sacrifice.
1090	1092	Fair enough. Fair enough.
1095	1098	- You wanted to be a gymnast. - Journalist.
1098	1101	- That's what I said. And? - I am a journalist. I work at The News.
1101	1104	Great. And you're with Joe.
1104	1106	Well, that's great. Great.
1106	1109	You're together, what, three weeks?
1110	1113	- A month. How did you know? - You take someone to the airport,
1113	1119	it's the beginning of a relationship. That is why I never do that at the beginning.
1119	1121	- Why? - Because eventually things move on
1122	1125	and you don't take someone. I never wanted anyone to say
1125	1128	"How come you never take me to the airport any more?"
1128	1133	It's amazing. You look normal, but actually you are the Angel of Death.
1133	1135	Are you gonna marry him?
1136	1141	We have known each other a month and neither of us wants to marry right now.
1141	1143	I'm getting married.
1143	1145	You are?
1145	1147	- You are? - Yeah.
1148	1152	- Who is she? - Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.
1153	1155	- You're getting married. - Yeah.
1156	1159	What's so funny about that?
1161	1164	It's just... It's just so optimistic of you, Harry.
1164	1166	You'd be amazed what falling madly in love can do for you.
1167	1170	Well, it's wonderful. It's nice to see you embracing life.
1170	1174	Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point where you get tired of the whole thing.
1174	1177	- What whole thing? - The whole "life of a single guy" thing.
1177	1182	You meet someone, you have the safe lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.
1182	1185	You go dancing, you do the white man's overbite,
1185	1189	go back to her place, have sex, and then you know what goes through your mind?
1189	1193	"How long do I have to lie here and hold her before I can go home?"
1193	1195	"Is 30 seconds enough?"
1195	1198	That's what you're thinking? Is that true?
1198	1200	Sure. All men think that.
1200	1203	How long do you like to be held afterwards? All night, right?
1204	1208	That's the problem. Somewhere between 30 seconds and all night is your problem.
1208	1210	- I don't have a problem. - Yeah, you do.
1225	1227	- Staying over? - Yes.
1227	1231	Would you like to have dinner? Just friends.
1231	1233	You don't believe men and women can be friends.
1233	1236	- When did I say that? - On the ride to New York.
1236	1238	No, no, no, no, I never said that.
1238	1242	Yes, that's right. They can't be friends.
1242	1247	Unless both are involved with someone. Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.
1247	1252	If two people are in relationships, the pressure of possible involvement is lifted.
1252	1255	That doesn't work either. The person you're with can't see
1255	1258	why you need to be friends with the person,
1258	1261	like it means something is missing from the relationship.
1261	1265	Then when you say "No, nothing is missing", the person you're with
1265	1269	accuses you of being attracted to the person you're just friends with,
1269	1271	which you probably are. I mean, let's face it.
1272	1274	So we're back to the rule before the amendment:
1274	1277	men and women can't be friends. Where's it leave us?
1277	1278	- Harry. - What?
1278	1280	Goodbye.
1280	1282	OK.
1289	1291	I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.
1295	1297	We were married 40 years ago.
1297	1301	We were married three years, we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.
1301	1303	- First you lived with Barbara. - Right, Barbara.
1304	1306	But I didn't marry Barbara. I married Marjorie.
1306	1309	- Then you got a divorce. - Right. Then I married Katie.
1309	1311	Another divorce.
1311	1316	Then a couple of years later at Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.
1316	1319	I was with some girl I don't even remember.
1319	1321	- Roberta. - Right. Roberta.
1321	1324	But I couldn't take my eyes off you.
1324	1327	I remember I snuck over to her and I said...
1327	1330	- What did I say? - You said "What are you doin' after?"
1330	1335	Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go for coffee, a month later we're married.
1335	1338	35 years to the day after our first marriage.
1341	1343	- I went through his pockets. - Marie, why?
1343	1344	FIVE YEARS LATER
1344	1347	- You know what I found? - No, what?
1347	1351	They just bought a dining-room table. His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.
1351	1354	- Where? - The point isn't where, Alice.
1354	1356	The point is he's never gonna leave her.
1356	1358	What else is new? You've known this for two years.
1359	1361	You're right. I know you're right.
1361	1365	Can't you find someone single? When I was single I knew lots of nice single men.
1365	1368	There must be someone. Sally found someone.
1368	1370	Sally got the last good one.
1370	1372	- Joe and I broke up. - What?
1372	1373	- When? - Monday.
1374	1376	- You waited three days? - Joe's available?
1376	1380	For God's sake, Marie, don't you have feelings? She's obviously upset.
1380	1383	I'm not that upset. We'd been growing apart for a while.
1383	1384	But you were a couple.
1384	1388	You had someone to go places with. You had a date on national holidays!
1388	1392	I said to myself "You deserve more than this. You're 31 ..."
1392	1396	- And the clock is ticking. - No, it doesn't start to tick until you're 36.
1396	1398	God, you're in such great shape.
1398	1402	Well, I've had a few days to get used to it, and I feel OK.
1403	1405	Good. Then you're ready.
1406	1409	- Really, Marie! - Well, how else do you think you do it?
1409	1413	I've got the perfect guy. I don't find him attractive, but you might.
1413	1415	She doesn't have a problem with chins.
1415	1419	- Marie, I'm not ready yet. - But you just said you were over him.
1419	1422	I am over him, but I'm in a mourning period.
1425	1427	- Who is it? - Alex Anderson.
1428	1431	You fixed me up with him six years ago.
1431	1433	Sorry. God.
1433	1436	All right, wait. Here. Here we go.
1436	1439	- Ken Darman. - He's been married for over a year.
1440	1442	Really?
1442	1444	Married.
1444	1446	- Wait. Wait, I got one. - Look,
1446	1450	there is no point going out with someone I might like if I met him at the right time,
1450	1454	but who right now would just be a transitional man.
1454	1459	OK, but don't wait too long. Remember what happened with David Warsaw?
1459	1463	His wife left him and everyone said "Give him some time. Don't move in too fast."
1463	1466	Six months later he was dead.
1466	1469	Are you saying I should marry quickly in case he's about to die?
1470	1472	At least you could say you were married.
1472	1477	I'm saying that the right man is out there. If you don't grab him, someone else will,
1477	1483	and you'll spend your life knowing that someone else is married to your husband.
1486	1488	Ten! Hut!
1502	1506	- When did this happen? - Friday. Helen comes home from work
1506	1509	and she says "I don't know if I wanna be married any more."
1509	1514	Like it's the institution. Nothing personal, just something she's been thinking about.
1515	1519	I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take time to think about it? Don't rush into anything."
1519	1522	- Yeah, right. - Next day she says she's thought about it.
1522	1526	She wants a trial separation. She just wants to try it.
1526	1529	But we can still date - like this is supposed to cushion the blow.
1529	1533	I got married so I could stop dating, so still dating is not a big incentive
1533	1537	since the last thing you wanna do is date your wife, who should love you.
1537	1540	Which is what I'm saying to her, when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.
1540	1543	So I say to her "Don't you love me any more?"
1543	1547	D'you know what she says? "I don't know if I've ever loved you."
1547	1551	That's harsh. You don't bounce back from that right away.
1551	1554	- Thanks, Jess. - No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.
1554	1555	That's particularly harsh.
1555	1558	Then she says someone in her office is going to South America
1559	1563	and she can sublet his apartment. I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.
1563	1567	"I can sublet his apartment" - the words still hang in the air like in a balloon...
1568	1569	- Like a cartoon. - Right.
1569	1574	So I go to the door and there are moving men there. Now I start to get suspicious.
1574	1578	I say "Helen, when did you call these movers?" She doesn't say anything.
1578	1581	So I ask the movers "When did this woman book you?"
1581	1586	And they're three huge guys. One with a T-shirt saying "Don't fuck with Mr Zero."
1586	1591	So I said "Helen, when did you make this arrangement?" She says "A week ago."
1591	1594	I said "You've known for a week and you didn't tell me?"
1594	1598	And she says "I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."
1600	1603	Mr Zero knew you were getting a divorce a week before you?
1603	1605	- Mr Zero knew. - I can't believe this!
1605	1609	- I haven't told you the bad part yet. - What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?
1609	1611	It's all a lie.
1612	1616	She's in love with somebody else. Some tax attorney.
1616	1620	- She moved in with him. - How did you find out?
1620	1622	I followed her. Stood outside the building.
1622	1625	- That's so humiliating! - Tell me about it.
1625	1629	And, you know, I knew. I knew that even though we were happy, it was an illusion.
1629	1632	And that one day she'd kick the shit outta me.
1632	1637	Marriages don't break up due to infidelity. It's a symptom something else is wrong.
1637	1640	Oh, really? Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!
1644	1648	So I just happened to see his American Express bill.
1649	1651	What do you mean "just happened" to see it?
1651	1655	Well, he was shaving, and there it was in his briefcase.
1655	1657	What if he came out and saw you?
1657	1660	You're missing the point. I'm telling you what I found.
1660	1665	He just spent $1 20 on a new nightgown for his wife.
1666	1671	- I don't think he's ever gonna leave her. - No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.
1671	1674	You're right, you're right. I know you're right.
1689	1692	Someone is staring at you in Personal Growth.
1695	1698	I know him. You'd like him. He's married.
1699	1703	- Who is he? - Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.
1703	1704	He's cute.
1705	1708	- You think he's cute? - How do you know he's married?
1708	1710	Last time I saw him he was getting married.
1710	1713	- When was that? - Six years ago.
1713	1716	So he might not be married any more.
1716	1718	Also, he's obnoxious.
1718	1722	It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she says "You're the most obnoxious man",...
1722	1725	- "The most contemptible". - ..then they fall madly in love.
1726	1729	- Also, he never remembers me. - Sally Albright.
1731	1733	- Hi, Harry. - I thought it was you.
1733	1735	It is. This is Marie.
1737	1739	Was Marie.
1739	1741	- How are you? - Fine.
1741	1743	- How's Joe? - Fine.
1744	1746	I hear he's fine.
1746	1749	- You're not with Joe any more? - We just broke up.
1750	1753	I'm sorry. That's too bad.
1753	1756	Yeah. Well, you know.
1756	1757	Yeah.
1757	1759	So...
1760	1761	- What about you? - I'm fine.
1762	1764	How's married life?
1765	1766	I'm getting a divorce.
1768	1771	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
1772	1775	Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?
1775	1776	What happened with you guys?
1777	1781	When Joe and I started seeing each other we wanted the same thing.
1781	1785	We didn't wanna get married because every time anyone we knew got married
1785	1789	it ruined their relationship. They practically never had sex again.
1789	1792	It's true. That's one of the secrets that no one ever tells you.
1793	1798	I would sit with my girlfriends who have kids... my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,
1798	1802	and she would complain about how she and Gary never did it any more.
1802	1805	She didn't even complain about it. She said it matter-of-factly.
1806	1809	She said they were up all night, they were both exhausted,
1809	1813	the kids took every sexual impulse they had out of them.
1814	1819	Joe and I would say "We're so lucky. We have this wonderful relationship."
1819	1823	"We can have sex on the kitchen floor and not worry about the kids walking in."
1823	1827	"We can fly off to Rome on a moment's notice."
1828	1831	Then one day I was taking Alice's girl for the afternoon
1831	1836	cos I promised to take her to the circus. We were in the cab playing I-spy.
1837	1839	"I spy a mailbox", "I spy a lamppost".
1840	1843	And she looked out the window and she saw this man and woman
1843	1847	with these two little kids, and the man had one of the kids on his shoulders.
1848	1851	And she said "I spy a family."
1852	1856	And I started to cry. You know, I just started crying.
1858	1860	And I went home and I said "The thing is, Joe,
1860	1863	we never do fly off to Rome on a moment's notice."
1864	1865	And the kitchen floor...?
1866	1870	Not once. It's this very cold, hard, Mexican ceramic tile.
1872	1874	Anyway,
1874	1879	we talked about it for a long time. I said "This is what I want" and he said "I don't".
1879	1883	And I said "Well, I guess it's over." And he left.
1885	1889	And the thing is, I... I feel really fine.
1889	1892	I am over him. I mean, I really am over him.
1893	1896	That was it for him. That was the most that he could give.
1896	1901	And every time I think about it, I am more and more convinced I did the right thing.
1901	1903	Boy, you sound really healthy.
1903	1905	Yeah.
1905	1908	- At least I got the apartment. - That's what everybody says to me.
1908	1913	But really, what's so hard about finding an apartment? You read the obituary column.
1913	1917	You find out who died, go to the building, and then you tip the doorman.
1917	1921	It'd be easier if they combined obituaries with the real-estate section.
1921	1924	Then you have "Mr Klein died, leaving a wife, two children
1924	1929	and a spacious three-bedroom apartment with a wood-burning fireplace."
1931	1934	The first time we met I really didn't like you that much.
1934	1936	- I didn't like you. - Yeah, you did.
1936	1939	You were just so uptight then. You're much softer now.
1939	1943	I hate that kind of remark. It sounds like a compliment, but it's an insult.
1943	1945	OK, you're still as hard as nails.
1946	1949	I didn't wanna sleep with you so you wrote it off as a character flaw,
1949	1954	instead of dealing with the possibility it might have something to do with you.
1954	1958	What's the statute of limitations on apologies?
1959	1962	- Ten years. - I can just get it in under the wire.
1967	1970	Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?
1970	1972	Are we becoming friends now?
1974	1976	Well...
1977	1978	Yeah.
1979	1982	Great! A woman friend.
1983	1988	You may be the first attractive woman I've not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.
1988	1990	That's wonderful, Harry.
1992	1995	- We were born in the same hospital,... - ln 1921 .
1995	1997	- ..seven days apart. - ln the same hospital.
1997	2000	- We both grew up one block apart. - We lived in tenements.
2000	2003	- On the Lower East Side. - On Delancey Street.
2003	2006	- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten. - He lived on Fordham Road.
2006	2009	- She moved when she was 1 1 . - I lived on 183rd Street.
2009	2014	- She worked on the 1 5th floor as a nurse. - I worked for a prominent neurologist,...
2015	2017	- I had a practice on the 14th floor. - ..Dr Permelman.
2018	2020	- We never met. - Never met.
2020	2023	- Can you imagine that? - D'you know where we met? An elevator.
2024	2026	- I was visiting family. - ln the Ambassador Hotel.
2026	2029	He was on the third floor, I was on the 1 2th.
2029	2033	I rode up nine extra floors just to keep talking to her.
2033	2035	Nine extra floors.
2045	2047	- Hello. - You sleeping?
2048	2050	- No, I was watching "Casablanca". - Channel?
2050	2053	- Eleven. - Thank you. Got it.
2053	2057	So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo than with Humphrey Bogart?
2057	2060	- When did I say that? - When we drove to New York.
2060	2064	- I never said that. I'd never say that. - All right, fine. Have it your way.
2066	2068	- Have you been sleeping? - Why?
2068	2072	Cos I haven't been sleeping. I really miss Helen.
2073	2079	Maybe I'm coming down with something. I watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.
2079	2082	"Buenos días, Seòor Cleaver. ?Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"
2082	2084	I'm not well.
2084	2088	I went to bed at 7.30. I haven't done that since third grade.
2088	2091	That's the good thing about depression - you rest.
2091	2094	- I'm not depressed. - OK. Fine.
2094	2097	Do you still sleep on the same side ofthe bed?
2097	2099	I did for a while, but now I'm using the whole bed.
2099	2104	God, that's great. I feel weird when just my leg wanders over.
2105	2107	I miss her.
2107	2110	- I don't miss him. I really don't. - Not even a little?
2111	2113	You know what I miss?
2113	2115	I miss the idea ofhim.
2116	2119	Maybe I only miss the idea ofHelen.
2120	2122	No, I miss the whole Helen.
2125	2127	Last scene.
2130	2133	Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
2134	2136	lngrid Bergman. She's low maintenance.
2136	2139	- Low maintenance? - There are two kinds of women.
2139	2143	- High maintenance and low maintenance. - And lngrid is low maintenance?
2143	2145	An LM, definitely.
2145	2147	- Which one am I? - The worst kind.
2147	2150	You're high maintenance, but you think you're low.
2150	2152	- I don't see that. - You don't see that?
2152	2155	"Waiter, a house salad, but not the regular dressing."
2155	2158	"I'll have balsamic vinegar - on the side."
2158	2161	"Then salmon with mustard sauce, but I want the sauce on the side."
2161	2165	- "On the side" is a big thing for you. - I just want it the way I want it.
2165	2167	I know. High maintenance.
2167	2170	.. 10,000F should pay our expenses.
2170	2172	Our expenses?
2172	2177	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
2178	2181	Best last line of a movie ever.
2184	2188	I'm definitely coming down with something. Probably a 24-hour tumour.
2188	2190	- You don't have a tumour. - How do you know?
2190	2195	- If you're so worried, go see a doctor. - No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.
2195	2198	- Will you be able to sleep? - If not, I'll be OK.
2198	2201	- What'll you do? - I'll stay up and moan.
2201	2204	Maybe I should practise now.
2209	2212	Good night, Harry.
2212	2214	Good night.
2248	2252	I had my dream again - where I'm making love and Olympic judges are watching?
2252	2255	I'd nailed the compulsories, so this is it: the finals.
2255	2258	I got a 9.8 from the Canadian, a perfect 10 from the American,
2258	2262	and my mother, disguised as an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.
2262	2264	Must've been the dismount.
2264	2267	Basically it's the same one I've had since I was 1 2.
2267	2270	- What happens? - No, it's... It's too embarrassing.
2270	2272	- Don't tell me. - OK, there's this guy.
2272	2276	- What's he look like? - I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.
2276	2279	A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?
2279	2281	He rips off my clothes.
2281	2285	- Then what happens? - That's it.
2286	2289	That's it? A faceless guy rips off your clothes.
2289	2293	And that's the sex fantasy you've had since you were 12. Exactly the same?
2293	2296	Well, sometimes I vary it a little.
2296	2298	- Which part? - What I'm wearing.
2303	2306	- What? - Nothing.
2307	2311	I have decided that for today
2311	2313	we are going to talk like this.
2314	2317	- Like this? - No. To repeat after me.
2317	2318	- Pepper. - Pepper.
2318	2319	- Pepper. - Pepper!
2319	2320	- Pepper. - Pepper.
2320	2321	- Pepper. - Pepper.
2321	2325	Waiter, there is too much pepper on my paprikash.
2325	2330	Waiter, there is too much pepper on my paprikash.
2330	2333	But I would be proud to partake of your pecan pie.
2333	2335	Oh, no!
2335	2337	- But I would be proud. - But I would be proud.
2337	2338	- To partake. - To partake.
2338	2341	- Of your pecan pie. - Of your pecan pie.
2341	2343	- Pecan pie. - Pecan pie.
2343	2346	- Pecan pie. - Pecan pie!
2346	2350	- Would you like to go to the movies? - Would you like to go...
2350	2356	Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would you like to go to the movies tonight?
2358	2360	Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.
2360	2363	What do you have? A hot date?
2363	2365	- Well, yeah. Yeah. - Really?
2365	2369	Yeah. I was gonna tell you, but, I don't know, I felt strange about it.
2370	2372	- Why? - Cos we've spent so much time together.
2372	2375	I think it's great that you have a date.
2375	2377	- You do? - Yeah.
2383	2386	- Is that what you're gonna wear? - Yeah.
2386	2389	Well, I don't know. Why?
2389	2393	I think you should wear skirts more. You look really good in skirts.
2393	2396	- I do? - Yeah.
2397	2402	I think hieroglyphics are really a comic strip about a character named Sphinxy.
2402	2405	- Harry, you should get out there, too. - I'm not ready.
2406	2409	- You should. - I would not be good for anybody now.
2409	2411	It's time.
2411	2414	It was the most uncomfortable night of my life.
2414	2416	See, no, it has to go this way.
2417	2420	The first date back is always the toughest, Harry.
2420	2422	You only had one date.
2422	2425	- How do you know it won't get worse? - How much worse can it get
2426	2431	than finishing dinner, having him pull a hair out of my head and floss with it?
2431	2434	We're talking dream date compared to my horror.
2434	2437	It started out fine. She's a very nice person.
2437	2441	And we're talking in this Ethiopian restaurant she wanted to go to.
2441	2444	I was making jokes, like "I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia."
2444	2448	"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order two empty plates and we can leave."
2448	2450	Yeah! Nothing from her, not even a smile.
2451	2454	I downshift into small talk and ask where she went to school.
2454	2457	She says Michigan State. And this reminds me of Helen.
2457	2460	All of a sudden I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack -
2460	2463	my heart's beatin' fast and I start sweatin' like a pig.
2463	2466	- Helen went to Michigan State? - No, Northwestern.
2466	2468	But they're both Big Ten schools.
2468	2471	I got so upset I had to leave the restaurant.
2473	2476	Harry, I think this takes a long time.
2476	2480	It might be months before we're able to enjoy going out with someone new.
2480	2481	Yeah.
2481	2484	Maybe longer before we're able to go to bed with someone new.
2484	2487	I went to bed with her.
2488	2491	- You went to bed with her?! - Sure.
2496	2499	- I don't understand this relationship. - What d'ya mean?
2499	2501	- Enjoy being with her? - Yeah.
2501	2503	- You find her attractive? - Yeah.
2503	2505	- And you're not sleeping with her? - No.
2505	2508	You're afraid to let yourself be happy.
2508	2511	Why can't you gimme credit for this? This is a big thing for me.
2511	2515	I never had a relationship with a woman that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.
2515	2518	- Are you finished? - I got a stack o' quarters. I was here first.
2519	2519	- Were not. - Was too.
2519	2521	- Were not! - Was too!
2521	2524	- Big jerk. - Little creep.
2524	2526	- Where was I? - You were growing.
2526	2528	Yeah.
2528	2531	It's very freeing. I can say anything to her.
2531	2535	Are you saying you can say things to her you can't say to me?
2535	2539	No, it's just a different perspective. I get the woman's point of view on things.
2539	2543	She tells me about the men she sees, and I talk to her about the women I see.
2543	2545	- You tell her about other women? - Yeah.
2545	2549	Like the other night, I made love to this woman and it was incredible.
2549	2553	I took her to a place that wasn't human. She actually meowed.
2553	2557	- You made a woman meow? - Yeah, and I can say these things to her.
2557	2561	And the great thing is, I don't have to lie because I don't wanna get her into bed.
2562	2565	- I can just be myself. - You made a woman meow?
2566	2569	What do you do with these women? Just get up and leave?
2569	2573	- Sure. - Explain how you do it. What do you say?
2573	2575	I say I have an early meeting, early squash game.
2575	2580	- You don't play squash. - They don't know that. They just met me.
2580	2582	- That's disgusting. - I know. I feel terrible.
2583	2585	I'm so glad I never got involved with you.
2585	2589	I just would've been some woman you had to get outta bed and leave at 3am
2589	2592	and go clean your andirons. You don't even have a fireplace.
2592	2596	- Not that I would know this. - Why are you upset? This isn't about you.
2596	2600	Yes, it is! You are a human affront to all women, and I am a woman.
2600	2603	Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.
2603	2606	Of course not. You're out the door too fast.
2606	2609	- I think they have an OK time. - How do you know?
2609	2612	What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.
2612	2615	- Because they... - Yes, because they...
2616	2621	- How do you know that they're really... - What're you saying? They fake orgasm?
2621	2624	- It's possible. - Get outta here!
2624	2627	Why? Most women at one time or another have faked it.
2627	2630	- They haven't faked it with me. - How do you know?
2631	2634	Because I know.
2635	2637	Right. That's right.
2637	2640	I forgot. You're a man.
2640	2642	- What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing.
2642	2646	All men are sure it never happened to them and most women have done it,
2646	2648	so you do the math.
2648	2650	You don't think I could tell the difference?
2650	2653	- No. - Get outta here.
2667	2668	Are you OK?
2672	2674	Oh, God.
2675	2678	Oh, God.
2684	2687	Oh, God.
2687	2688	Oh, yeah, right there.
2695	2697	Oh, God.
2697	2700	Yes! Yes! Yes!
2700	2702	Yes! Yes!
2702	2704	Yes!
2705	2708	Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!
2709	2712	Yes! Yes! Yes!
2712	2715	Yes! Yes! Yes!
2718	2720	Oh, God.
2730	2731	I'll have what she's having.
2733	2735	~ Sleigh bells ring
2735	2737	~ Are you listening?
2738	2742	~ ln the lane snow is glistening
2742	2744	~ A beautiful sight
2744	2746	~ We're happy tonight
2747	2749	~ Walking in a winter wonderland
2750	2753	~ Gone away is the bluebird
2754	2758	~ Here to stay is a new bird
2759	2763	~ He sings a love song as we go along
2763	2766	~ Walking in a winter wonderland
2767	2770	~ ln the meadow we can build a snowman
2771	2775	~ And pretend that he is Parson Brown
2775	2777	~ He'll say "Are you married?"
2777	2779	~ We'll say "No, man"
2779	2783	~ "But you can do thejob when you're in town, brother"
2783	2787	~ Later on we'll conspire
2788	2792	~ As we dream by the fire
2792	2796	~ To face unafraid the plans that we made
2796	2799	~ Walking in a winter wonderland
2800	2804	~ lfthey asked me
2804	2806	~ I could write a book
2808	2812	~ About the way you walk and whisper...
2812	2816	- I like you with no beard. I see your face. - It is my face!
2817	2819	Whoa! Dipping you.
2822	2825	- Thank you for taking me out tonight. - Don't be silly.
2825	2829	The next New Year's Eve, if neither of us is with anybody, you got a date.
2829	2831	Deal.
2832	2835	See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.
2837	2840	~ lsjust to tell them
2840	2843	~ That I love you a lot
2844	2849	~ Then the world discovers
2849	2853	~ As my book ends
2853	2857	~ How to make two lovers
2857	2859	~ Of friends
2859	2863	Hey, everybody! Ten seconds to New Year!
2863	2865	- Ten,... - Wanna get some air?
2865	2868	- Yeah. - ..seven, six, five, four,
2868	2871	three, two, one!
2871	2873	Happy New Year!
2893	2895	- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.
2902	2908	He was a head counsellor at boys' camp, I was a head counsellor at girls' camp,
2908	2911	and they had a social one night, and he walked across the room.
2912	2914	I thought he was coming to talk to my friend Maxine,
2915	2918	cos people were always crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.
2918	2921	But he was coming to talk to me, and he said
2921	2924	"I'm Ben Small of the Coney lsland Smalls."
2924	2928	At that moment I knew. I knew the way you know about a good melon.
2930	2933	You sent flowers to yourself.
2933	2937	$60 I spent on this big arrangement of flowers, and I wrote a card
2937	2941	that I planned to leave on the table where Arthur would just happen to see it.
2941	2943	What did the card say?
2943	2946	"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."
2946	2948	- Did it work? - He never even came over.
2948	2952	He forgot a charity thing his wife is chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!
2952	2955	- Of course he isn't. - You're right. I know you're right.
2955	2959	- Where is this place? - Somewhere on the next block.
2959	2961	I can't believe I'm doing this.
2961	2964	Harry is one of my best friends and you are one of my best friends.
2964	2968	And if you two hit it off, we could still be friends, instead of drifting apart
2969	2972	like you do when you date someone who doesn't know your friends.
2972	2976	You and I haven't drifted apart since I started seeing Arthur.
2976	2979	If Arthur ever left his wife and I actually met him,
2979	2983	I am sure that you and I would drift apart.
2983	2985	He's never gonna leave her.
2985	2987	Of course he isn't.
2987	2989	You're right. I know you're right.
2990	2992	- I dunno about this. - It's just a dinner.
2992	2997	I've finally gotten to a place where I'm comfortable with just me and my work.
2997	3001	- If she's so great why don't you date her? - I told you. We're just friends.
3001	3003	- So she's not attractive? - No, she is attractive.
3004	3008	- You said she had a good personality. - She has a good personality.
3010	3011	What?
3011	3015	When someone's not attractive, they're described as having a good personality.
3015	3019	If you'd asked about looks and I'd said "She has a good personality",
3019	3021	she's not attractive.
3021	3024	But because I mentioned she has a good personality, she can be either.
3024	3028	Attractive with a good personality, or not attractive with a good personality.
3028	3030	- So which one is she? - Attractive.
3030	3032	But not beautiful, right?
3035	3040	It's like, whenever I read Jimmy Breslin, it's as if he's leaving a wake-up call
3040	3044	- for the City of New York. - What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?
3044	3048	He's saying that we've got people in the city who are on welfare...
3049	3051	Would I have seen any of your windows?
3052	3056	A couple of weeks ago I did a thing with hostages.
3056	3058	- The people in blindfolds. - Yeah.
3058	3061	I thought it was like late '80s.
3062	3063	That's interesting.
3063	3066	Let's just say I'm not a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.
3066	3071	Well, he's the reason I became a writer, but that's not important.
3083	3086	Harry, you and Marie are both from New Jersey.
3087	3088	- Really? - Where?
3088	3090	- South Orange. - Haddonfield.
3097	3101	- So, what are we gonna order? - I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.
3101	3105	Jess, Sally is a great orderer. Not only does she pick the best,
3105	3108	but she orders it in a way even the chef didn't know how good it could be.
3108	3111	- Restaurants have become too important. - I agree.
3112	3116	"Restaurants are to people in the '80s what theatre was to people in the '60s."
3116	3118	I read that in a magazine.
3118	3120	I wrote that.
3120	3123	- Get outta here. - No, I did! I wrote that.
3123	3126	I've never quoted anything from a magazine. That's amazing.
3126	3130	Don't you think that's amazing? And you wrote it?
3130	3132	I also wrote "Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."
3132	3135	- Get over yourself! - I did!
3135	3138	- Where did I read that? - New York Magazine.
3138	3140	Sally writes for New York Magazine.
3140	3144	You know, that piece had a real impact on me. I don't know much about writing...
3144	3147	It spoke to you, and that pleases me.
3147	3150	I mean, you have to admire people who can be that articulate.
3150	3154	Nobody has ever quoted me back to me before.
3163	3166	I've been looking for a red suede pump.
3168	3171	What do you think of Jess?
3172	3175	- Well... - Do you think you could go out with him?
3176	3179	- I don't know... - Cos I feel really comfortable with him.
3180	3183	- You wanna go out with Jess. - If it would be all right with you.
3183	3186	Sure. Sure. I'm just worried about Harry.
3186	3191	He's sensitive, he's going through a rough period, and I don't want you to reject him.
3191	3193	I wouldn't. I totally understand.
3193	3196	If you don't think you're gonna call Marie, do you mind if I call her?
3197	3198	- No, no. - Good. Good.
3198	3202	But for tonight you shouldn't. I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.
3202	3206	You can call Marie, but wait a week or so. Don't make any moves tonight.
3206	3210	Fine. No problem. I wasn't even thinking about tonight.
3210	3214	Well, I don't feel like walking any more. I think I'll get a cab.
3214	3217	- I'll go with you. - Great! Taxi!
3228	3234	A man came to me and said "I found nice girl for you."
3234	3238	"She lives in the next village
3238	3241	and she is ready for marriage."
3242	3246	We were not supposed to meet until the wedding,
3246	3248	but I wanted to make sure.
3248	3253	So I sneak into her village, hid behind a tree,
3253	3255	watch her washing the clothes.
3256	3262	I think if I don't like the way she looks, I don't marry her.
3262	3265	But she looked very nice to me.
3265	3268	So I said "OK" to the man.
3268	3270	We get married.
3270	3273	We married for 55 years.
3276	3279	FOUR MONTHS LATER
3280	3283	- I have to get this. - Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.
3283	3287	- We'll find something. Great stuff. - Should have gone to the plant store.
3287	3290	- Here. Perfect for them. - What's that?
3290	3293	Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.
3293	3296	- Why is this necessary in life? - I don't know.
3296	3299	Look at this. Also makes great fries.
3300	3303	Good. Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.
3303	3306	Sally, this is the greatest.
3306	3308	Sally, please report to me.
3308	3311	Look. This is the greatest. You're gonna love this.
3311	3316	This is a singing machine. Look, you sing the lead and this has the backup.
3316	3319	- This is from Oklahoma! - "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".
3319	3322	Yes, perfect.
3323	3326	~ Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
3326	3329	~ When I take you out in my surrey
3329	3333	~ When I take you out in my surrey with the fringe on top
3334	3335	Now you!
3335	3337	~ Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
3337	3340	~ When I drive those high-steppin' strutters
3340	3342	~ Nosey pokes'll peek through the shutters
3342	3345	~ And their eyes will pop!
3345	3348	~ The wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown
3348	3350	~ The dashboard's genuine leather
3350	3353	~ With isinglass curtains that will ro...
3353	3355	What?
3355	3358	It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.
3358	3361	- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it... - It's Helen.
3361	3363	Helen?
3363	3366	She's coming right towards me.
3373	3377	- How are you, Harry? - Fine. I'm fine.
3378	3381	This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.
3381	3383	Harry.
3387	3390	I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright. Helen Hillson
3390	3392	and Ira.
3392	3394	Sally.
3394	3397	- Nice to meet you. - Hi.
3399	3401	Well...
3402	3405	- See you. - Yeah. Bye.
3406	3409	Nice to meet you, Ira.
3414	3416	You OK?
3417	3419	Yeah, I'm perfect.
3419	3423	She looked weird, didn't she? She looked really weird.
3423	3426	- I've never seen her before. - Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.
3426	3428	- Must be retaining water. - Harry!
3428	3431	Believe me, the woman saved everything.
3434	3436	Sure you're OK?
3436	3439	I'm fine. Look, it had to happen at some point.
3439	3443	In a city of eight million, you're bound to run into your ex-wife. So it happened.
3443	3445	And now I'm fine.
3448	3451	I like it. It works. It says "home" to me.
3451	3454	All right. All right. We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.
3455	3457	What do you think?
3457	3459	- It's nice. - Case closed.
3459	3462	Of course he likes it - he's a guy.
3462	3464	Sally?
3465	3467	What's so awful about it?
3467	3471	It's so awful, there's no way to begin to explain what's so awful about it.
3471	3473	Honey, I don't object to your things.
3473	3477	If we had room, you could put your things in it, like your bar stools...
3477	3481	Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait. You don't like my bar stools?
3481	3484	Harry, come on, someone has to be on my side.
3484	3487	I'm on your side. I just want you to have good taste.
3487	3489	I have good taste!
3489	3494	Everybody thinks they have good taste, but they couldn't all have good taste.
3494	3498	You know, it's funny. We started out like this, Helen and I.
3498	3502	We hung things, we picked out tiles together. Then you know what happens?
3502	3508	Six years later you're singing "Surrey with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!
3508	3512	- Do we have to talk about this right now? - Yes. Right now is the perfect time,
3513	3516	because I want our friends to benefit from the wisdom of my experience.
3517	3521	Right now everything is great. Everyone is happy and in love, and that's wonderful.
3521	3526	But sooner or later, you'll be screaming at each other about who'll get this dish.
3526	3531	This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls to the legal firm of "That's mine, this is yours".
3531	3533	- Harry! - Please.
3533	3536	Jess, Marie, do me a favour for your own good.
3537	3541	Put your name in your books right now before you don't know whose is whose,
3541	3546	because some day you'll go 1 5 rounds over who's gonna get this coffee table.
3546	3551	This stupid, wagon-wheel, Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!
3553	3556	- I thought you liked it. - I was being nice!
3561	3563	He just bumped into Helen.
3570	3573	I want you to know
3573	3577	that I will never want that wagon-wheel coffee table.
3585	3588	I know, I know, I shouldn't have done it.
3588	3593	Harry, you have to try to find a way of not expressing every feeling you have,
3593	3595	every moment that you have them.
3595	3597	- Oh, really? - Yes.
3598	3600	There are times and places for things.
3601	3606	Well, the next time you're giving a lecture on social graces, tell me cos I'll sign up.
3606	3609	Hey! You don't have to take your anger out on me.
3610	3612	I'm entitled to throw anger your way.
3612	3616	Especially when I'm being told how to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners!
3616	3619	- What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing bothers you!
3619	3623	- You never get upset about anything! - Don't be ridiculous!
3623	3624	What?
3624	3629	You never get upset about Joe. I never see it back up on you. How is it possible?
3629	3633	- Don't you experience feelings of loss? - I don't have to take this crap.
3633	3636	- If you're over Joe, why not see people? - I see people!
3637	3640	See people! Have you slept with one person since Joe?
3640	3643	What the hell does that have to do with anything?
3643	3647	That will prove I'm over Joe because I fuck somebody?!
3647	3650	You have to move back to New Jersey cos you've slept with everyone in New York.
3651	3654	I don't see that turning Helen into a faint memory for you.
3654	3657	Besides, I will make love when it is making love.
3657	3661	Not the way you do it, like you're out for revenge or something.
3661	3664	Are you finished now?
3664	3666	Yes.
3666	3668	Can I say something?
3668	3670	Yes.
3672	3675	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3685	3688	Don't say a word!
3691	3694	It's a monkey, a monkey. Monkey see, monkey do.
3694	3698	- It's an ape. Going ape. - It's a baby!
3698	3701	- Planet ofthe Apes! - She said baby! Try Planet ofthe Dopes.
3701	3705	- It doesn't look like a baby. - Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.
3705	3707	- Baby ape! - Stop with the apes.
3707	3710	- Baby's breath. - Rosemary's Baby's mouth?
3711	3713	- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?" - Kiss the baby!
3713	3717	- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth"! - Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!
3718	3720	- 1 5 seconds. - A big mouth.
3720	3722	- Baby boom! - Baby...
3722	3725	Draw something resembling anything!
3725	3728	- Crying baby. Kiss the baby. - Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!
3729	3732	- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby". - "No sir, don't mean maybe."
3732	3735	- That's it. Time's up. - Baby talk.
3735	3738	Baby talk? What's that? That's not a saying.
3739	3742	But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping the nation! I hear them talking!
3743	3745	Final score. Our team: 1 10.
3745	3747	You guys: 60.
3747	3750	- Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix. - Pathetic.
3751	3755	- I can't draw. - That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.
3755	3757	You're wonderful.
3757	3760	- Who wants coffee? - I do, and I love you.
3760	3763	- D'you have tea? - lndustrial strength.
3763	3766	- I'll help you. Decaf? - Yeah.
3767	3769	- Three. - Yes, please.
3769	3773	- Where's the bathroom? - Through that door, down the hall.
3779	3781	Never looked like a baby to me.
3781	3782	- Which part? - All of it.
3782	3786	- You were gonna show me a book cover. - Yeah, it's in the den.
3786	3790	Julian, help yourself. Have some more wine, whatever, OK?
3790	3792	I like saying den. Got a nice ring to it.
3793	3795	Emily's a little young for Harry, don't you think?
3796	3798	Well, she's young, but look what she's done.
3798	3801	What has she done? She makes desserts.
3801	3805	- Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you? - He's a good guy. You should talk to him.
3805	3806	He's too tall to talk to.
3807	3810	She makes 3,500 chocolate-mousse pies a week.
3811	3813	Emily is "Aunt Emily"?
3813	3816	He took us to a Met game last week. It was great.
3816	3820	- You all went to a Met game together? - Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing.
3820	3821	But Sally hates baseball.
3822	3824	Harry doesn't even like sweets.
3824	3826	Julian is great.
3826	3828	I know. He's a grown-up.
3828	3832	- Emily is terrific. - Yeah. But when I asked where she was
3832	3835	when Kennedy was shot, she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"
3847	3849	- Hello? - Are you alone?
3849	3851	Yeah. I was just finishing a book.
3851	3854	- Could you come over? - What's the matter?
3854	3857	- He's getting married. - Who?
3857	3859	Joe!
3859	3862	I'll be right there.
3865	3868	- Hi. - Are you all right?
3870	3872	Come on in.
3875	3878	- I'm sorry to call you so late. - It's all right.
3879	3881	- I need a Kleenex! - OK.
3882	3883	OK. OK.
3884	3886	He just called me up, "Wanted to see how you were",
3886	3889	"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."
3889	3892	His secretary's on vacation, everything's all backed up.
3892	3896	He's got a big case in Newark, blah, blah, blah.
3897	3901	And I'm sitting on the phone thinking "I am over him, I really am over him,
3901	3905	I can't believe I was ever remotely interested in any of this."
3906	3909	And then he said "I have some news."
3913	3917	She works in his office. She's a paralegal. Her name is Kimberly.
3919	3921	He just met her!
3921	3926	She's supposed to be his transitional person, not "the one"!
3932	3936	All this time, I've been saying that he didn't wanna get married.
3938	3940	But the truth is,
3940	3942	he didn't wanna marry me.
3945	3948	He didn't love me.
3951	3954	If you could take him back right now, would you?
3956	3958	No!
3958	3961	But why didn't he wanna marry me?
3961	3964	- What's the matter with me? - Nothing.
3964	3966	- I'm difficult. - You're challenging.
3967	3970	- I'm too structured. I'm closed off. - But in a good way.
3971	3974	No, no, no. I drove him away.
3976	3979	And I'm gonna be 40!
3980	3981	When?
3981	3983	- Some day. - ln eight years.
3984	3989	But it's there! It's just sitting there like this big dead end.
3990	3995	And it's not the same for men. Charlie Chaplin had babies when he was 73.
3995	3997	Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.
4004	4006	Come here. Come here.
4006	4008	It's gonna be OK.
4008	4010	It's gonna be fine, you'll see.
4011	4014	Go ahead. It's not one of my favourites anyway.
4016	4018	It's gonna be OK. Hm?
4024	4026	Hm? OK?
4026	4028	OK.
4031	4034	- I'll make some tea. - Harry, could you hold me a little longer?
4034	4036	Oh, sure.
4042	4044	OK? Hm?
4075	4077	Are you comfortable?
4077	4079	Sure.
4083	4087	- D'you want something to drink? - No, I'm OK.
4088	4092	I'm going to get up for some water, so it's really no trouble.
4092	4094	OK. Water.
4147	4152	You have all your video tapes alphabetised and on index cards.
4152	4153	Thank you.
4154	4157	- D'you wanna watch something? - No. Not unless you do.
4157	4160	No. That's OK.
4173	4176	- D'you wanna go to sleep? - OK.
4209	4212	Where are you going?
4212	4214	I gotta go.
4215	4218	Gotta go home, change my clothes and go to work. And so do you.
4218	4222	But after work I'd like to take you out to dinner, if you're free. You free?
4222	4225	- Yes. - Fine. I'll call you later.
4225	4227	- Fine. - Fine.
4246	4248	- Yours! - Hello.
4248	4250	- Sorry to call so early. - Are you all right?
4250	4253	No one I know would call at this hour.
4254	4256	- No one I know would call. - It's awful.
4256	4257	- I need to talk. - What happened?
4258	4259	- Harry came over. - I went to Sally's.
4260	4262	- I was upset Joe was marrying. - One thing led to another.
4262	4266	- Before I knew it we were kissing. Then... - ..we did it.
4266	4267	They did it!
4267	4269	- That's great! - We prayed for it.
4269	4272	- You shoulda done it before. - We said you should do it.
4272	4274	- You belong together. - You killed two birds with one stone.
4274	4277	- Two wrongs make a right. - How was it?
4277	4278	- During part was good,... - Good,...
4279	4281	- ..then I felt suffocated. - ..then it wasn't.
4281	4282	- Sorry. - The worst.
4282	4283	- I had to go. - He left.
4283	4285	- I feel bad. - I'm embarrassed.
4285	4286	I don't blame you.
4287	4288	- I feel ill. - I'm catching a cold.
4289	4290	Look, it didn't work out.
4290	4294	Never sleep with anyone when you find out your ex is marrying.
4294	4296	- Who's talking? - Is that Jess?
4296	4298	- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR. - It's Bryant Gumbel.
4298	4300	Wanna have breakfast?
4300	4302	- No, I'm not up to it. - I feel too awful.
4302	4304	- Good. - I mean, it's so early.
4304	4306	- But call me later. - I'll call you later.
4306	4308	- OK. Bye. - Bye.
4308	4310	- Bye. - Bye.
4311	4313	- God! - I know.
4315	4317	Tell me I'll never have to be out there again.
4321	4323	You will never have to be out there again.
4327	4329	I'll just say we made a mistake.
4330	4332	Sally, it was a mistake.
4335	4337	I just hope I get to say it first.
4338	4340	I hope she says it before I do.
4343	4347	- It was a mistake. - I am so relieved that you think so, too.
4348	4351	I'm not saying last night wasn't great.
4351	4354	- It was! - Yes, it was!
4355	4359	- We just never should have done it. - I couldn't agree more.
4359	4362	- I am so relieved! - Great.
4362	4364	Yeah.
4366	4368	Two mixed green salads.
4396	4401	It is so nice when you can sit with someone and not have to talk. Hm?
4405	4407	Most of the time, you go to bed with someone,
4408	4411	then she tells you all her stories, you tell her all your stories.
4412	4415	But with Sally and me, we'd already heard each other's stories.
4415	4419	So once we went to bed, we didn't know what we were supposed to do. You know?
4419	4421	Sure, Harry.
4422	4424	I don't know.
4424	4429	Maybe you get to a point in a relationship where it's too late to have sex. You know?
4438	4441	Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?
4441	4443	I don't think so.
4444	4449	- Is he seeing anyone? - He was seeing this anthropologist, but...
4450	4454	- What does she look like? - Thin, pretty, big tits.
4455	4457	Your basic nightmare.
4461	4463	What d'ya think?
4464	4466	Marie...
4467	4468	Tell the truth.
4470	4472	It's just beautiful.
4502	4508	We are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of Marie and Jess.
4509	4512	And to consecrate their vows of matrimony.
4512	4515	The vows they will take join their lives.
4515	4520	The wine they will share binds all their hopes together.
4520	4523	And by the rings they will wear,
4523	4527	they will be known to all as husband and wife.
4537	4541	I've never seen her so happy. She's a different person.
4541	4546	Oh, yeah, she is. It's great, but what're we gonna do about you?
4546	4548	- Me? - Hon, you wanna dance?
4548	4551	- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do. - Excuse us.
4554	4556	- Hi. - Hello.
4560	4563	- Nice ceremony. - Beautiful.
4565	4570	Boy, the holidays are rough! Every year I try to get from Thanksgiving to New Year.
4571	4573	A lot of suicides.
4574	4577	- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp? - Thank you.
4578	4581	- How've you been? - Fine.
4581	4582	- Seeing anybody? - Harry.
4583	4585	- What? - I don't wanna talk about this.
4585	4588	- Why not? - I don't want to talk about it.
4588	4592	Why can't we get past this? Are we gonna carry this thing around for ever?
4592	4597	- Forever? It just happened! - It happened three weeks ago.
4597	4601	You know how a year to a person is like seven years to a dog?
4601	4602	Yes!
4605	4607	Is one of us supposed to be a dog in this scenario?
4608	4610	- Yes. - Who is the dog?
4610	4613	- You are. - I am! I am the dog!
4613	4616	I am the dog! I...
4622	4626	I don't see that. You are the dog. You act like what happened didn't mean anything.
4627	4630	No, I don't, but why does it have to mean everything?
4630	4635	Because it does! You know it better than anyone, cos after it happens you walk out!
4635	4638	- I didn't walk out. - Sprinted is more like it.
4638	4641	- We both agreed it was a mistake. - The worst mistake I ever made!
4643	4645	- What do you want from me? - Nothing!
4645	4651	Fine! But let's just get one thing straight. I did not go over there to make love to you.
4651	4655	But you looked at me with these weepy eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."
4655	4659	- What was I supposed to do? - Are you saying you took pity on me?
4659	4661	- No! I was... - Fuck you!
4665	4668	Everybody, could I have your attention, please?
4668	4672	I'd like to propose a toast, to Harry and Sally.
4672	4674	To Harry and Sally.
4674	4678	If Marie or I had found either of them remotely attractive,
4678	4681	we would not be here today.
4690	4694	~ Have yourselfa merry little Christmas
4695	4698	~ Let yourselfbe light
4699	4705	~ From now on our troubles will be out ofsight
4709	4714	~ Have yourself a merry little Christmas
4714	4718	~ Make the yuletide gay
4719	4724	~ From now on our troubles will be miles away
4726	4728	Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season,
4728	4732	and I thought I'd remind you that it's the season of forgiveness.
4732	4736	And, although it's not widely known, it is also the season of grovelling.
4737	4739	So, if you felt like calling me back,
4739	4743	I'd be more than happy to do the traditional Christmas grovelling.
4743	4745	Give me a call.
4760	4763	Hi, I'm not home. I'll call you right back.
4763	4767	If you're there, please pick up. I really wanna talk to you.
4770	4774	The fact you're not answering leads me to believe you're either, A: not at home,
4774	4777	B: home, but don't wanna talk to me, or C:
4778	4782	home, desperately wanna talk to me, but trapped under something heavy.
4782	4785	If it's either A or C, please call me back.
4787	4791	Obviously she doesn't wanna talk to me. What do I have to do, be hit on the head?
4791	4795	If she wants to call, she'll call. I'm through actin' like a schmuck.
4795	4799	~ If you're feeling sad and lonely
4799	4802	~ There's a service I can render
4802	4805	~ Tell the one who digs you only
4805	4808	~ I can be so warm and tender
4808	4810	~ Call me
4810	4813	~ Maybe it's late tojust call me
4813	4817	~ Don't be afraid to just phone moi
4817	4821	~ Call me and I'll be around
4821	4822	Give me a call.
4822	4825	- Hi, Harry. - Hello. Hi! Hi!
4825	4827	I didn't know that you would... That you were there.
4828	4830	- What're you doing? - I was just on my way out.
4830	4833	Where you going?
4833	4835	- What do you want, Harry? - Nothing. Nothing.
4836	4839	I... I just called to say I'm sorry.
4841	4842	OK.
4849	4852	- I gotta go. - Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.
4852	4857	What're you doin' for New Year's? Going to the Tylers' party? I don't have a date.
4857	4863	If you don't have a date, we always said we could be together for New Year's and...
4863	4867	I can't do this any more. I am not your consolation prize.
4867	4869	Goodbye.
4877	4882	And here we are once again. The 16th annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve",
4882	4884	coming to you live...
4884	4888	What's so bad about this? You got Dick Clark - tradition.
4888	4890	You got Mallomars, the greatest cookie of all time.
4891	4895	And you're about to give the Knicks their first championship since 1973.
4912	4914	I don't know why I let you drag me to this.
4918	4923	This is much better. Fresh air, I have the streets all to myself.
4923	4927	Who needs to be at a big, crowded party, pretending to have a good time?
4927	4930	Plus, this is the perfect time to catch up on my window-shopping.
4931	4932	This is good.
4943	4946	So the guy says "Read the card."
4956	4959	- I'm going home. - You'll never get a taxi.
4960	4961	Oh, God!
4988	4990	You realise that we could never be friends.
4990	4993	- Why not? - What I'm saying is,
4993	4996	men and women can't be friends, cos the sex part always gets in the way.
4996	4998	That's not true!
4998	5000	No man can be friends with a woman he finds attractive.
5000	5004	- He always wants to have sex with her. - What if they don't wanna have sex?
5004	5008	Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already out there, so the friendship is doomed.
5008	5011	And that is the end ofthe story.
5011	5013	- I guess we're not gonna be friends then. - Guess not.
5013	5015	That's too bad.
5015	5018	You were the only person that I knew in New York.
5022	5026	~ It had to be you
5030	5033	~ It had to be you
5037	5040	~ I wandered around
5040	5044	~ And I finally found
5044	5048	~ The somebody who
5051	5057	~ Could make me be true
5057	5062	~ And could make me be blue...
5063	5066	- I'm going. - It's almost midnight!
5066	5070	- The thought of not kissing somebody... - I'll kiss you.
5071	5073	Hey, taxi! Taxi!
5073	5075	Taxi!
5075	5077	Shit.
5078	5082	- Come on, stay. Please. - Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.
5083	5085	- Wait two minutes. - I'll call you tomorrow.
5085	5090	~ Might never be mean
5092	5096	~ Might never be cross
5096	5099	~ Or try to be boss
5100	5104	~ But they wouldn't do
5107	5111	~ For nobody else
5111	5114	~ Gave me a thrill
5115	5117	~ With all your faults
5118	5121	~ I love you still
5121	5123	~ It had to be you...
5123	5127	I've been doin' a lot of thinkin', and the thing is, I love you.
5127	5130	- What? - I love you.
5130	5134	- How d'you expect me to respond to this? - How about you love me, too?
5135	5139	- How about I'm leaving? - Doesn't what I said mean anything?
5139	5143	Sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve, I know you're feeling lonely,
5143	5148	but you just can't show up, say you love me and expect that to make it all right.
5148	5151	- It doesn't work this way. - Well, how does it work?
5151	5155	- I don't know, but not this way. - Then how about this way?
5155	5158	I love that you get cold when it's 71° out.
5158	5160	I love that it takes you 1 1/2 hours to order a sandwich.
5161	5164	I love that you get a crinkle here when you look at me like I'm nuts.
5164	5168	I love that after I spend a day with you I smell your perfume on my clothes.
5168	5172	And I love that you are the last person I wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.
5172	5176	And it's not because I'm lonely or because it's New Year's Eve.
5176	5180	I came cos when you realise you wanna spend the rest of your life with someone
5180	5184	you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.
5187	5189	You see?
5189	5191	That is just like you, Harry.
5192	5196	You say things like that and you make it impossible for me to hate you!
5197	5200	And I hate you, Harry.
5201	5203	I really hate you.
5206	5208	I hate you.
5225	5228	What does this song mean? My whole life, I don't know.
5228	5232	"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" - should we forget old acquaintances?
5232	5234	Or if we forget them, should we remember them?
5234	5237	Which is not possible cos we already forgot 'em!
5237	5241	Maybe it just means we should remember that we forgot them, or something.
5244	5247	Anyway, it's about old friends.
5253	5256	The first time we met we hated each other.
5256	5260	No, I hated you. The second time we met, you didn't even remember me.
5260	5263	I did, too! I remembered you.
5263	5265	The third time we met we became friends.
5265	5269	- We were friends for a long time. - And then we weren't.
5269	5271	And then we fell in love.
5271	5275	- Three months later we got married. - It only took three months.
5275	5277	12 years and three months.
5277	5281	- We had a really wonderful wedding. - It really was a beautiful wedding.
5281	5285	- We had this enormous coconut cake. - Huge coconut cake with the tiers.
5286	5288	And there was this very rich chocolate sauce on the side.
5289	5292	Right. Cos not everybody likes it on the cake cos it makes it soggy.
5292	5297	Particularly, the coconut soaks up a lot, so it's important to keep it on the side.
5297	5299	~ It had to be you
5299	5302	~ It had to be you
5302	5305	~ I wandered around and finally found
5305	5307	~ The somebody who
5307	5309	~ Could make me be true
5310	5312	~ Could make me be blue
5312	5315	~ And even be gladjust to be sad
5315	5317	~ Thinking of you
5318	5321	~ But you say ee-ther, and I say either
5321	5323	~ You say nee-ther, I say neither
5323	5326	~ Ee-ther, either Nee-ther, neither
5326	5328	~ Let's call the whole thing off
5328	5331	~ You say potato and I say pot-ahto
5331	5333	~ You say tomato, I say tom-ahto
5333	5336	~ Potato, pot-ahto Tomato, tom-ahto
5336	5338	~ Let's call the whole thing off
5338	5343	~ Oh, if we call the whole thing off, then we must part
5343	5349	~ And though if we ever part, that would break my heart
5349	5351	~ You say laughter, I say larf-ter
5351	5353	~ You say after, I say arf-ter
5353	5355	~ Before we know we need each other
5355	5358	~ So we'd better call, call it off, oh!
5359	5360	~ Let's ~ Call it off!
5361	5363	~ Oh, let's ~ Call it off!
