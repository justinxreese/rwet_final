103	105	- 'Morning, Mr. Pirovitch. - Good morning.
105	107	- Always the first one. - It's none of your business.
108	110	Let me tell you, it doesn't hurt to be too early.
110	114	What for and why? Who sees you? Me. And who sees me? You.
114	118	What does it get us? Can we give each other a raise? No.
118	120	What are you doing with that bicycle? You can't take it.
120	122	Better not let Mr. Matuschek see.
122	124	Why don't you tell him? It's all right with me.
124	127	You know where I was last night while you were home soaking your feet?
127	129	Running my legs off for Mrs. Matuschek.
129	132	"Pepi, go to the dressmaker." And when I come back:
132	134	"Pepi, will you please pick up a package at the drugstore?"
135	137	- Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Kaczek.
137	137	Good morning.
137	139	- How's your boy? - Much better, thanks.
139	143	- We called Dr. Hegedus. - He's a very expensive doctor.
143	144	What can you do?
144	146	I thought I'd cut down on my cigars for a few weeks.
146	149	- Good morning. - Good morning, llona.
149	152	- That's a new silver fox! It's stunning! - Thank you.
152	154	- It must have been pretty expensive. - It was.
154	156	I hesitated a long time before I bought it.
156	160	I said, "No, I can't afford it." Still, I couldn't take my eyes off it.
160	163	- I said, "No, I have no right to..." - And then he said, "Go on and take it."
163	165	- Trying to be clever. - Shut up.
165	167	Good morning.
167	170	Pepi, go to the drugstore and get me a bicarbonate of soda.
170	171	- What's the matter? - Do you feel well?
171	173	It's all right.
173	176	- Good morning, good morning. - Good morning.
176	177	- Want to hear a joke? - No.
178	180	What's the matter, folks?
180	183	Not awake yet? Look at me. I bet I haven't slept half as much as you.
184	186	Friends, Romans, countrymen, to tell you the truth...
187	189	...I had quite a time last night.
189	191	We don't want to hear the poor girl's name.
191	194	- Kralik, how was the dinner last night? - Oh, yes, that's right.
194	198	Kralik had dinner with the boss last night. How was it? Tell us all about it.
199	201	- Are you a partner now, Mr. Kralik? - Don't be funny.
203	204	How was it?
204	207	It was a very nice evening, and I enjoyed myself.
207	209	- I bet the food was good. - You can imagine.
209	212	Tell me, is it true Mrs. Matuschek had her face lifted?
212	213	How could I know that?
213	216	- How old did she look to you last night? - Well, 40.
216	218	She had her face lifted.
218	220	I think Mrs. Matuschek is a very charming woman.
220	223	- Who said she isn't? - Don't try to make something out of it.
223	225	I didn't say Mrs. Matuschek is not charming.
225	227	But I said she is. What's wrong with that?
227	229	So the food was good?
229	231	Seven courses, not including the hors d'oeuvres.
231	234	- Were you sitting next to her? - I was. What do you think of that?
234	237	- I bet you were brilliant. - No, I kept still and tried to learn.
237	239	- Your bicarbonate, Mr. Kralik. - Thanks, Pepi.
239	242	- Bicarbonate? - I had a little too much goose liver.
242	244	What's the matter? Wasn't it any good?
244	247	Now, look here, vadas. Just a minute. Folks, come over.
247	249	Did you hear... I want you to hear this.
249	252	Did I make any derogatory remark about the goose liver?
252	253	- No, not any! - Not one word!
253	255	I merely said that I had too much goose liver.
255	258	- "A little too much goose liver." - That's right.
258	261	"A little too much goose liver." Not one word more, and not one less.
267	269	- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek. - Yes, good morning.
270	271	Here.
273	275	- Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
284	286	Who put this 32.50 suitcase in the window?
287	288	I did, Mr. Matuschek.
289	292	- I guess it's all right. - Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
293	295	- Yeah. Pepi. - Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
296	300	Go across the street to the drugstore, and get me some bicarbonate of soda.
300	301	Yes, sir.
302	304	Allow me, Mr. Matuschek. May I help?
307	309	There we are, Mr. Matuschek.
323	327	- Pirovitch. Want to hear something nice? - Yes. What is it?
328	329	A letter from a girl.
331	334	"My heart was trembling as I walked into the post office...
335	337	"...and there you were, lying in box 237.
338	341	"I took you out of your envelope and read you...
342	343	"...read you right there...
344	346	"...oh, my dear friend."
346	349	- What is all this? - You see, I wanted to buy an encyclopedia.
349	351	Encyclopedia? What're you talking about?
351	354	You come to a time in your life when you get tired of going to cafés...
354	357	...dance halls every night, and you want to improve yourself.
357	359	You want to study something about art...
359	362	...literature and history, how people live in Brazil.
363	365	Tell me what has all this to do with the letter?
365	367	You know I can't afford a new encyclopedia...
367	369	...so I was looking through the ads in the paper...
370	373	...and I got on the wrong page, and I came across this ad, and...
373	376	Wait a minute, I have it right here. Here, read that.
378	381	"Modern girl wishes to correspond on cultural subjects...
381	384	"...anonymously with intelligent, sympathetic, young man.
386	390	"Address: Dear Friend, Post Office 15, Box 237."
391	393	I know those ads. The papers are full of them.
393	396	- How long has this been going on? - We've exchanged four letters.
396	398	- Four letters? - And she's no ordinary girl.
398	400	Now listen to this:
401	403	"Are you tall? Are you short?
403	406	"Are your eyes blue? Are they brown? Don't tell me.
407	410	"What does it matter so long as our minds meet?"
410	413	- That's beautiful. - It is, isn't it?
413	415	Now, wait a minute.
415	418	"We have enough troubles in our daily lives.
418	420	"There are so many great and beautiful things...
420	422	"...to discuss in this world of ours...
422	424	"...it would be wasting precious moments...
424	427	"...if we told each other the vulgar details...
427	430	"...of how we earn our daily bread, so don't let's do it."
430	431	Mr. Kralik.
431	433	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
436	437	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
437	440	I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers.
440	443	What do you think of it? I think it's great. Well, open it.
448	449	No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us.
449	452	But you haven't listened to it. It plays Ochi Tchornya.
452	455	Even if it played Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, I'd still say no.
455	457	I just don't like the idea.
457	459	It's wonderful how you make up your mind so quickly.
459	461	I've been in this business for 35 years.
461	464	It took me a whole hour to decide that I like this box.
464	467	But, of course, you're a genius. You know so much more than I.
467	470	- Mr. vadas. - Coming, Mr. Matuschek.
470	472	- Miss Novotni. - Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
473	474	Look here, what do you think of this?
474	477	I want your honest opinion. Don't let me influence you.
477	480	All I want is your honest opinion.
488	490	Well, Miss Novotni?
490	492	I think people who smoke cigarettes...
492	494	...and love to hear Ochi Tchornya will like it.
494	495	I'd even go further.
495	498	I think it'll make music lovers out of smokers...
498	501	...and smokers out of music lovers. It's sensational!
501	503	Yes, well. Mr. Kralik, have you thought it over?
503	506	Yes. I still think it's inadvisable.
507	509	Well, give me one reason.
510	512	Let's say that a man smokes 20 cigarettes a day.
513	515	That means that 20 times a day he opens this box...
515	517	...and 20 times a day he has to listen to Ochi Tchornya.
517	519	It's a perfectly terrible idea.
519	521	It's imitation leather, the glue's no good...
521	525	...in two weeks it will fall apart, and all you'll have is Ochi Tchornya.
525	528	You don't have to tell me that it's imitation leather. I know that.
529	531	You sell things and let me do the buying.
531	532	- Excuse me, Mr. Matuschek. - Yes?
532	535	Miklos Brothers is calling about the cigarette box.
535	536	Miklos, yes.
537	539	Yes, Mr. Miklos.
542	544	Can I call you back in about five minutes?
544	547	I'd like a little more time to think about it.
547	549	No, no, it's not the price.
549	552	It's just that I'm not quite sure about the whole idea.
553	554	Yes.
555	556	Yes, Mr. Miklos.
557	558	What?
559	561	You can't expect me to make up my mind in five minutes!
562	564	If that's the case, then I'll have to say no.
564	565	I'm sorry.
580	582	- Good morning, madam. - Good morning.
582	585	- A lovely bag, don't you think? - Yes, very.
585	586	It's an imported model.
586	588	We have it in pigskin, several different colors...
588	591	...and with or without fitted accessories.
591	595	- I really didn't come in to buy a bag. - I beg your pardon. What can I show you?
596	599	To tell you the truth, I really didn't come in to buy anything.
599	600	That's perfectly all right.
600	603	If you wish to look around, make yourself at home.
603	604	Yes, thank you.
606	609	I wonder if I could see Mr. Matuschek.
609	612	Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek is quite busy at the moment.
613	616	- I could call him if you wanted. - I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
616	620	If you tell me your wishes, it's possible I could take care of them.
621	624	I noticed in your shop window that you're having a summer sale.
625	627	Yes, everything in the shop is marked down 25 percent...
627	631	...some articles even more. Take for instance this compact.
631	635	Yesterday you couldn't get it for a penny less than 3.90. Now it's 2.25.
635	639	- Yes, that's a wonderful bargain. - Everything in the shop is a bargain today.
639	642	Yes, I imagine you'll be doing big business.
642	644	I have no doubt of it. You were very wise to come early.
644	647	It'll be such a rush, we won't be able to help the customers.
647	651	- Maybe you should take on extra help. - We probably will.
651	654	Maybe you could use me. I'm looking for a job.
658	661	That wasn't very nice, letting me go through the whole routine.
661	665	I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to. Could you help me get a job here?
665	666	I'd like to, but there's no opening.
666	670	But you just told me you'd need some extra people because of the rush.
670	672	Look around for yourself.
672	674	You can see what kind of business we're doing.
675	676	I beg your pardon.
677	677	Yes, madam?
678	680	How much is that belt in the window, the one that says 2.95?
681	683	- 2.95. - Oh, no.
686	690	- May I tell you my qualifications? - Lf I could do anything for you, I'd do it.
690	691	I'm not inexperienced.
691	693	I know the situation, and there's no chance.
693	695	I worked for two years at Blasek and Company...
695	697	...and 10 months at Latzki Brothers.
697	699	Even if you'd worked at Mintz and Kramer...
699	701	I did! I took care of the finest clientele.
701	704	We don't deal with that class here. We have middle-class trade.
704	705	What trade do you think they have?
706	707	They'd take me back now.
707	709	- Why don't you go back? - That's another story.
709	712	If it was up to me, I'd put you to work. But I'm not the boss.
712	715	- Then why don't you let me see him? - He's in sort of a bad mood today.
715	717	I'll take a chance. Maybe I can cheer him up.
717	721	Young lady, I've been here for nine years, and I know Mr. Matuschek inside out.
721	723	I can predict his every reaction.
723	726	I could tell you word for word exactly what he'd say.
726	729	Mr. Kralik, I beg your pardon.
729	731	Just one moment, please.
731	732	It's all right.
734	736	So, you know every reaction of mine?
737	738	You know me inside out?
739	741	You know what I think, even before I thought of it.
742	744	You're not only a genius, you're a mind reader.
744	746	- Mr. Matuschek... - Never mind.
747	750	Good morning, madam. I am Mr. Matuschek.
750	753	- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek. - Here, please, sit down.
754	756	I don't know what the difficulty is...
756	758	...but I can assure you, that the word "impossible"...
758	761	...is not in the vocabulary of Matuschek and Company.
761	763	- I am so happy to hear you say that. - I mean it.
763	765	- Mr. Matuschek. - Yes, madam?
765	767	I was at Blasek and Company...
767	770	Oh, madam. I'm sure you'll find much nicer things in my shop.
770	773	No, I mean, I worked there. I'm looking for a job.
773	775	No, no, that's impossible. It's out of the question.
775	777	- But... - I have no time. I'm very busy.
779	782	I'm very sorry. I'm afraid you're just wasting your time.
782	784	But I've got to have a job.
784	787	- Mr. Kralik. - Just a moment, Mr. Matuschek.
787	790	- Have you tried Baum's Department Store? - Every entrance.
790	793	I don't know what to tell you. Maybe after inventory.
794	796	- When will that be? - In a week or so.
796	798	- Kralik! - Just a minute, Mr. Matuschek.
798	800	Please, may I leave my address?
800	802	If we need anybody, you'll be the first.
802	803	My name is Klara Novak, Duna Street, 42.
803	806	And if you need me in a hurry, you can phone 246-422.
806	807	It's the grocery store downstairs.
808	810	Ask for Johanna, and tell her you have a message for Klara.
810	813	"Business message for Klara." Yes, I have that.
813	815	- Yes, Mr. Matuschek? - Close the door.
819	823	Why did you put me in that situation in front of the whole shop?
823	825	I'm very sorry, sir, but it was not my fault.
825	828	- Whose fault was it? Mine? - Yes.
828	832	What's the matter with you, Kralik? You're my oldest employee.
832	834	I do everything I can to show my appreciation.
834	836	I ask you to my house.
836	839	- I'm very grateful, sir. - You have a funny way of showing it.
839	842	You know how much I value your judgment...
842	844	...and on every occasion you contradict me.
844	845	Whatever I say, you say, "no."
845	849	From now on, I say, "yes." Yes, Mr. Matuschek. Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
849	851	Certainly, Mr. Matuschek. Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
851	855	- That was a nice party last night. - Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
856	860	- Yes, I had a lot of fun, didn't you? - Yes.
861	863	I'm glad you enjoyed yourself so much.
863	866	That little poem that you wrote in Mrs. Matuschek's guest book...
867	868	...did you make that up yourself?
868	870	It's sort of half and half.
870	874	- How do you mean? - Half Shakespeare and half me.
874	877	I just changed the lines around to suit the occasion.
877	880	I made that last line rhyme with Matuschek, that's all.
880	883	- Mrs. Matuschek liked it very much. - Thank you.
884	886	You made a fine impression on her.
887	889	Mrs. Matuschek thinks a lot of you.
890	892	And you know, I think a lot of Mrs. Matuschek.
896	898	- Mr. Matuschek? - Yes?
898	901	I've found a customer for the cigarette box. What price shall I quote?
901	903	Well, let me see.
903	906	It costs us 2.85, and I think we get five percent...
909	911	Let me take care of this, Mr. Matuschek.
912	915	Look, there's no use waiting now. Believe me.
915	917	If there's an opening, you'll be the first.
917	920	Just a moment. Tell me, would you buy a box like this?
921	924	Mr. Matuschek, I couldn't buy anything at the moment.
924	927	No, I want your opinion. Your honest opinion.
928	930	Now, don't let me influence you. I just want your opinion.
931	932	Do you like this box?
933	935	Yes, I do. I think it's lovely.
935	936	Yes. Why?
937	938	Why?
940	941	I think it's romantic.
942	943	What's romantic about it?
946	949	Well, cigarettes and music, I don't know.
950	953	It makes me think of moonlight and...
954	956	...cigarettes and music.
956	959	- There's the woman's point of view. - Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
960	962	- Mr. Matuschek. - Yes, Miss...
962	963	Novak.
963	967	- How much are you selling it for? - Let me see. 4.25.
968	969	4.25?
969	970	Yes, 4.25.
970	973	That's a bargain! That's a real bargain!
979	981	Good morning, madam. It's a lovely box, isn't it?
982	986	Oh, yes. It's a candy box, isn't it?
986	990	Yes, madam, a candy box, and I should say, a very unusual one.
991	993	May I open it for you?
995	998	Yes, madam. That's Ochi Tchornya. It's a very popular classic.
999	1002	No, that would never do. Where do people get ideas like that?
1002	1004	Imagine, every time you take a piece of candy...
1005	1008	...you have to listen to that song. I couldn't buy a thing like that. Too silly.
1009	1011	I know just what you mean, madam.
1011	1014	Yet some customers like it for the very thing you object to.
1014	1016	We've sold quite a few.
1016	1017	- Really? - Yes, madam.
1018	1021	There's no denying that we all have a weakness for candy.
1021	1023	I don't mean to say anything against candy.
1023	1028	No, I only mean that sometimes we are inclined to overdo it a little.
1028	1029	I suppose so.
1029	1032	Madam, have you any idea how many pieces of candy you eat a day?
1032	1034	No, I never gave it a thought.
1034	1036	We pick up a piece of candy absent-mindedly...
1036	1038	...and then we take another piece.
1038	1040	Before we know it, we've gained a few pounds.
1040	1043	That's when our troubles begin. Massages, electric cabinets.
1043	1044	I know it.
1044	1047	Now, this little box makes you candy-conscious.
1048	1050	That's what we designed it for.
1050	1053	Every time you open it, the little tinkling song is a message to you.
1054	1055	"Too much candy, now be careful."
1058	1059	How much is it?
1059	1062	It's 5.50, reduced from 6.95. It's a real bargain.
1063	1065	- I'll take it. - Thank you, madam.
1066	1067	What do you say now?
1068	1071	I think people who like to smoke candy and listen to cigarettes will love it.
1075	1077	Don't let me influence you.
1077	1080	I want your opinion, your honest opinion, that's all I want.
1090	1092	- Good morning. - Good morning, sir.
1101	1103	- 'Morning. - Good morning, Kralik.
1103	1105	I've got a big dinner date tonight.
1105	1108	- With the boss? - No, he never invites me anymore.
1108	1110	How do you figure him out, anyway?
1110	1114	I give up. It's certainly very difficult to get along with him these days.
1114	1115	He never talks to me anymore.
1116	1118	I hope he's feeling more cheerful today.
1119	1121	He better, because I'm going to ask him for a raise.
1121	1122	A raise?
1124	1126	Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
1126	1128	- No, go ahead. - It's confidential.
1128	1129	Yes, sure.
1129	1132	Suppose that a fellow like me wants to get married.
1132	1136	That's wonderful! That's the best thing that could happen. Who's the girl?
1136	1138	Wait a minute. What did I say? I said, "suppose."
1138	1140	I said, "a fellow like me." I didn't say me.
1140	1143	How much does it cost you to live, you and Mrs. Pirovitch?
1143	1146	- Leaving out the children. - Why fool yourself?
1148	1151	Well, let's say temporarily. How much does it cost?
1151	1154	- It can be done. - Yeah?
1154	1158	Yes, and very nicely. Naturally, you can't be extravagant.
1158	1160	Suppose a fellow gets an apartment with three rooms.
1160	1161	Dining room, bedroom, living room.
1161	1164	What do you need three rooms for? You live in the bedroom.
1165	1168	- Where do you eat? - In the kitchen. You get a nice big kitchen.
1168	1169	Where do you entertain?
1169	1172	What are you, an ambassador? Who do you want to entertain?
1172	1176	If someone is really your friend, he comes after dinner.
1176	1177	Oh, no.
1178	1180	- Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Novak.
1180	1183	- How's your wife, Mr. Pirovitch? - Oh, my goodness!
1183	1184	I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus.
1185	1187	- Something serious with your wife? - No, she couldn't be better.
1188	1190	- Why do you want to call him? - Lf I don't, he'll come.
1190	1194	Excuse me, I'd better telephone him. I hope it isn't too late.
1204	1205	Miss Novak?
1205	1206	Yes, Mr. Kralik?
1206	1210	I noticed that you wore a yellow blouse with light-green dots yesterday.
1210	1214	No, Mr. Kralik. As usual, you're mistaken. It was green with light-yellow dots.
1214	1216	Everybody else thought it was very becoming.
1216	1218	I don't remember remarking about your neckties.
1218	1221	If you think I couldn't say anything about your neckties...
1221	1224	...just ask Mr. vadas. My blouse is none of your business.
1224	1227	I'm sorry. Mr. Matuschek seems to think it is my business.
1227	1229	Yes, that's right. I'm working under you.
1229	1233	I'll call you every morning and describe what I'm going to wear.
1233	1236	Before I select my next wardrobe, my dressmaker will give you samples.
1236	1240	- Imagine you dictating what I should wear. - I don't care what you wear.
1240	1241	For a circus pony, it's all right.
1241	1243	I have my own troubles without your blouse...
1243	1245	...between Matuschek and me.
1245	1247	I sold as much yesterday as anybody else.
1247	1250	For a rainy Monday three weeks before Christmas, 95.50 isn't bad.
1250	1251	- Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that? - Yes.
1251	1252	And what did he say?
1252	1253	"Not to come in that blouse."
1253	1255	- Tell him I won't. - I will!
1258	1259	Good morning.
1260	1264	I caught him in time. Saves me five pengo, and that counts when you're married.
1264	1267	- Is this tie all right to wear to work? - Quite all right.
1267	1268	Tell me, who is the girl?
1268	1271	Well, you know that girl I was corresponding with?
1271	1274	- Yes, about the cultural subjects. - Yeah.
1274	1276	Well, after a while, we got on the subject of love...
1276	1278	...naturally on a very cultural level.
1278	1280	What else can you do in a letter?
1280	1282	She is the most wonderful girl in the world.
1282	1284	Is she pretty?
1284	1287	She has such ideals and such a viewpoint on things...
1287	1290	...that she's so far above the girls you meet today, there's no comparison.
1290	1293	- So she is not so very pretty? - Don't say that.
1293	1296	I'm sorry. The main thing is that you like her.
1296	1298	- Yeah, I hope I will. - What do you mean?
1298	1301	You love a girl, and you don't know if you like her?
1301	1304	Well, that's just the question. I haven't met her yet.
1304	1306	- What? You haven't met her yet? - No.
1306	1308	I keep postponing it and postponing it.
1309	1310	I'm scared.
1310	1313	This girl thinks I'm the most wonderful person in the world.
1313	1316	And after all, there is a chance she might be disappointed.
1316	1318	Yes, there is a chance.
1318	1320	- On the other hand... - You might be disappointed, too.
1320	1322	And I don't dare think about it.
1324	1327	Pirovitch, did you ever get a bonus?
1328	1329	Yes, once.
1330	1333	Yeah, the boss hands you the envelope.
1333	1336	You wonder how much is in it, and you don't want to open it.
1337	1340	As long as the envelope's closed, you're a millionaire.
1340	1342	You keep postponing that moment and...
1344	1346	...you can't postpone it forever.
1346	1349	I'm meeting her tonight, 8:30 in a café.
1349	1351	- A red carnation? - Yeah.
1351	1352	Yeah.
1352	1356	She's using one for a bookmark in a copy of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
1356	1357	I'm wearing one in my lapel.
1358	1359	I haven't slept for days.
1359	1361	I'm sure she'll be beautiful.
1361	1364	Not too beautiful. What chance would a fellow like me...
1364	1366	- What do you want, a homely girl? - No.
1367	1369	You knock on wood for me.
1370	1373	Just a lovely, average girl.
1374	1376	That's all I want.
1382	1384	Thank you, my good man.
1384	1385	'Morning, everybody.
1389	1392	Here, keep the change. Send your boy through college.
1392	1393	Thank you, sir.
1394	1397	I see by the expression on your underpaid faces...
1397	1398	...you wonder where I get money.
1398	1400	No, Mr. vadas, I don't wonder.
1400	1402	- What do you mean? - I mean, I don't wonder.
1410	1412	Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
1415	1417	This window looks terrible.
1417	1420	There isn't a shop on the street that doesn't look better.
1420	1422	It's a wonder we get any customers.
1422	1425	We'll stay tonight after closing hours and redecorate it.
1426	1429	- I'll have to get out of it some way. - Klara, you haven't got a chance.
1429	1433	I have an engagement tonight at 8:30. I have to go home first. I have to change.
1434	1437	Ilona, did you notice the blouse I wore yesterday, the green one?
1437	1440	With the light yellow dots? I thought it was simply stunning.
1440	1443	I'm so glad. I'm planning to wear it tonight.
1446	1449	Hello? Yeah, hello, darling.
1451	1454	Well, you were sleeping, and I didn't want to disturb you.
1454	1456	You came home late last night.
1456	1458	I thought perhaps you'd like to sleep a little longer.
1459	1461	No, I'm not angry. Did you have a good time?
1465	1467	That's all that matters, isn't it?
1468	1468	What?
1469	1471	1,000 pengo?
1472	1475	But, Emma, I don't understand it. Only last Monday I gave you...
1476	1480	No, I'm not complaining. It's quite a bit of money.
1481	1484	Yeah, all right. I'll send it over as soon as possible.
1485	1486	Yeah, goodbye.
1491	1493	Come in.
1497	1499	- What is it? - I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
1499	1503	- Is it important? - It's important to me.
1503	1505	Is it important to Matuschek and Company?
1506	1507	Not exactly, sir.
1507	1510	Well, then, I'm sorry. I'm busy. You'll have to see me later.
1517	1519	- Pardon me, sir. - What is it now?
1519	1523	Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed.
1523	1526	- Has it? - Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
1526	1528	Really, I'm completely at a loss to understand it.
1529	1530	After all, I do my work.
1530	1532	And you get paid for it?
1532	1533	Yes, sir.
1533	1534	- Every month? - Yes, sir.
1535	1538	Yes, everything seems to be all right then, doesn't it?
1539	1540	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
1546	1548	Did you see him?
1548	1550	I'm not going to stand for this much longer.
1550	1553	What does that man want of me? Why does he always pick on me?
1553	1556	- You are his oldest employee. - That's a fine reason.
1557	1559	He picks on me, too. The other day he called me an idiot.
1559	1563	What could I do? I said, "Yes, Mr. Matuschek, I'm an idiot."
1563	1564	I'm no fool.
1564	1567	Listen, maybe he has business worries.
1567	1569	Or maybe he has some trouble with his wife.
1570	1573	Is that true, Pirovitch? Is he having trouble with his wife?
1573	1576	I don't know, it's none of my business.
1576	1580	I'm talking to Kralik. What do you want? I don't know anything. Leave me alone.
1580	1583	Kralik, don't be impulsive, not at a time like this.
1583	1585	Not when millions of people are out of work.
1585	1589	- I can get a job anywhere. - Can you? Let's be honest.
1589	1592	I'll take a chance. I'm no coward, you know. I'm not afraid.
1592	1595	- I am. I have a family. - Well, I haven't.
1596	1597	Think it over.
1598	1600	Those were nice letters, weren't they?
1611	1613	It's already been paid for. Leave it downstairs at the desk.
1613	1617	Mr. Kralik, do you think I'll have to work tonight? After all, I'm a child.
1617	1619	- No, you don't have to stay. - Do you mean it?
1619	1622	- I'll straighten it out. - Thanks, Mr. Kralik!
1629	1631	- May I help you? - No, thank you.
1632	1636	I put all the imported bags over there on the shelf. Is that how you wanted it?
1636	1639	I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me if there's anything wrong.
1639	1641	Since when have you become interested in my opinions?
1642	1644	I want to please you, Mr. Kralik. I'm working under you.
1645	1648	- You don't have to keep harping on that. - No, I didn't mean it that way at all.
1648	1650	Regardless of what I think of you...
1650	1652	...I believe that anybody who works with you...
1652	1655	...and doesn't get a great deal out of it, is just plain dumb.
1656	1659	Just what do you mean? What do you think of me personally?
1660	1663	I mean, since you ask...
1663	1666	...no matter what anybody else says, I think you're a gentleman.
1667	1669	I try to be.
1670	1672	You have no idea what that means to a working girl.
1672	1674	What a girl goes through in some shops.
1674	1677	Take for instance when I was with Foeldes Brothers & Sons.
1677	1680	The sons were all right, but the brothers, Mr. Kralik...
1680	1682	That's why I like it here so much.
1682	1685	When you say, "Miss Novak, let's go in the back to put bags on the shelf"...
1685	1687	...you really want to put some bags on the shelf.
1688	1689	And that's my idea of gentleman.
1690	1693	I just don't believe in mixing bags with pleasure.
1696	1697	Mr. Kralik.
1698	1700	- Yes, Miss Novak? - About that blouse...
1700	1703	- I'm sorry, but I had to do that. - I want to thank you. I'm glad you did it.
1703	1706	After thinking it all over, you're so right.
1706	1708	- That blouse was awful. - Oh, no, not awful.
1709	1712	It was. I wouldn't admit it at the time, but what woman would?
1712	1715	We hate to admit we are wrong. That's why we are so feminine.
1716	1719	This is the first time you've shown a little sense.
1719	1723	- Quite a change in you, Miss Novak. - I know it, Mr. Kralik.
1723	1725	If you keep this up, we'll get along much better.
1725	1729	- Thank you, Mr. Kralik. - That's quite all right, Miss Novak.
1729	1732	I was planning to wear that awful blouse tonight.
1732	1734	- I have a date with... - Tonight?
1734	1736	Didn't you hear what Mr. Matuschek said?
1736	1738	We have to stay and decorate the windows.
1738	1740	- I almost forgot. - Yes.
1744	1747	Would it be possible, do you think you could spare me tonight?
1747	1749	And then maybe Mr. Matuschek would let me off.
1749	1753	So that's why I'm a gentleman. That's why you've learned from me now?
1753	1755	- I don't understand. - You want the night off?
1755	1757	- I have to, Mr. Kralik. - You're out of luck.
1757	1760	That was such an obvious trick. I almost fell for it, too.
1760	1763	I have to get off tonight. It's terribly important.
1763	1765	For the last six months, you've just antagonized me and...
1765	1768	You haven't been very nice to me either.
1768	1769	Whatever I do, it's wrong.
1769	1771	If I wrap a package, it's not right.
1771	1773	If I make a suggestion, and some of them are very good...
1774	1775	- Here. ...you don't listen.
1775	1778	Everything has to be done exactly your way, and then you don't like it.
1778	1782	When I first came into this shop, I was full of life and enthusiasm...
1782	1785	...and now I'm nothing. You've taken my personality away.
1785	1787	You're a dictator, that's what you are.
1787	1790	Mr. Kralik, any day now I may be in a position...
1790	1794	...where I don't have to work anymore. Then I'll really tell you what I think.
1794	1797	As for that blouse, I think it's beautiful, and I'm going to wear it tonight.
1797	1799	Mr. Kralik, I don't like you.
1802	1804	Mr. Matuschek, may I speak to you for a moment?
1804	1805	What is it?
1805	1808	Do you think you could spare me tonight?
1809	1812	Let me see, we need three people, to dress the "A" window.
1812	1815	- Mr. Kralik? - Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
1815	1817	Can you get along without Miss Novak tonight?
1818	1820	Mr. Matuschek, I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
1820	1823	- You want to go, too? - Yes, I'd appreciate it very much...
1823	1827	What is this? Does everybody want to leave? Is this the interest you show?
1827	1831	- Once a year, I ask you to stay. - I'm sorry, if I'd only known yesterday.
1831	1835	You want a special invitation. Next time, I'll send you an engraved announcement.
1836	1840	I have talked everything over with Mr. Kralik. I know his ideas.
1840	1843	Miss Novotni and I can manage the novelty window by ourselves.
1843	1845	Did I ask you for your advice?
1845	1848	What do you mean you talked this over? Who's shop is this?
1849	1850	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
1851	1853	So you want the evening off, Mr. Kralik?
1853	1856	That's all right. I think we can manage.
1856	1859	This is the first time in years I have asked a favor.
1859	1861	I gave you the evening. What more do you want?
1861	1863	- Do you want a brass band? - You're being unjust.
1864	1865	I'm being unjust?
1865	1867	Once a year, I ask six ladies and gentlemen...
1867	1870	...six, mind you, when next door, a shop twice as big as mine...
1870	1872	...employs only four.
1872	1875	Good morning, madam. Is there something I can show you?
1875	1877	Have you any traveling bags for men with a zipper?
1877	1880	We have all types of traveling bags for men with zippers.
1880	1884	Thank you very much. I'm doing some window-shopping for my husband.
1884	1887	- He'll be here tomorrow. - I'll be delighted to serve him, madam.
1887	1890	- Thank you. Good morning. - Good morning, madam.
1892	1895	Six people who stand around here for days telling jokes...
1896	1899	...and talking about the movies, while I pay the gas and the rent...
1899	1901	...and the light, and the taxes, and their salaries.
1902	1904	Good morning, Matuschek and Company.
1905	1906	What?
1908	1909	Just a moment.
1909	1911	Mr. Pirovitch.
1916	1918	Yes? Mama, I called you.
1918	1921	We are decorating the window after closing hours...
1921	1924	...so we won't have to have dinner with the Laszlos. Isn't that wonderful?
1925	1927	Yes, I knew you'd be glad. Goodbye, Mama.
1930	1933	Six people I ask, one day a year, to be so kind...
1933	1935	...as to redecorate a window.
1935	1937	And you have the nerve, Mr. Kralik...
1937	1940	...the oldest employee in the place, who should set an example.
1940	1943	You spoke like this to me yesterday. What did I do then?
1943	1946	The whole week you've treated me like this, and without any reason.
1947	1948	Without any reason?
1949	1951	Maybe I have more reason than you think.
1953	1955	It's obvious that you're not satisfied with me.
1956	1958	You can draw your own conclusions.
1959	1961	In that case, I think there's just one thing to do.
1962	1964	Perhaps we'd better call it a day.
1967	1970	Matuschek and Company. Yes, Mrs. Matuschek, he's here.
1971	1972	Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone.
1973	1974	Hello, Emma.
1975	1976	No, I'm not coming home tonight.
1978	1979	All right.
1979	1981	All right, I'll send it right over.
1983	1988	Put 1,000 pengo in an envelope and have Pepi take it to Mrs. Matuschek.
1988	1992	Pepi is out. He has quite a few deliveries, and he won't be back until after lunch.
1992	1995	Mr. Kralik and I always have lunch at Farago's.
1995	2000	It's only a few blocks from your home. We can deliver it. Right, Mr. Kralik?
2001	2002	Yes.
2002	2003	No, thank you, Mr. Kralik.
2006	2007	Mr. vadas.
2007	2009	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
2010	2013	I don't like to break in on your lunch hour.
2013	2015	It's perfectly all right. It'll be a pleasure.
2015	2017	Thank you, Mr. vadas.
2043	2044	Mr. Kralik...
2044	2047	...will you come to my office. I'd like to talk to you.
2047	2048	Yes, sir.
2063	2063	Yes, sir.
2064	2066	Mr. Kralik...
2066	2069	...l've been thinking all day about what you said this morning.
2069	2072	I'm sorry, Mr. Matuschek. I'm afraid I lost my temper.
2072	2074	No, I think you were right.
2075	2078	I really believe that you'd be happier somewhere else.
2085	2086	Do you think so, sir?
2086	2088	Yes, I'm sure of it.
2095	2097	I guess there's nothing more to be said.
2097	2100	No. Let me see.
2100	2103	You're naturally entitled to a month's pay.
2103	2105	That's 200 pengo.
2105	2107	- That's right, isn't it? - Yes, sir.
2108	2111	Will you, please, sign this receipt.
2115	2118	And here's a letter...
2119	2122	...which certainly won't handicap you in seeking employment.
2123	2124	Thank you, sir.
2127	2130	I guess we might as well say goodbye.
2131	2133	- Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek. - Goodbye.
2144	2145	Well?
2154	2155	What happened?
2167	2168	"To whom it may concern:
2170	2174	"I wish to state that Mr. Alfred Kralik leaves my employ of his own accord.
2177	2181	"Mr. Kralik started with Matuschek and Company nine years ago as an apprentice.
2182	2186	"With diligence, he advanced to the position of clerk.
2187	2190	"For the last five years, he has been our first salesman.
2192	2196	"We have found him reliable, efficient, resourceful.
2197	2199	"We can recommend him without reserve.
2201	2205	"He carries with him our best wishes for his success in his future career.
2207	2208	"Hugo Matuschek."
2232	2236	Kralik, I still can't believe it. There's no reason.
2236	2238	The boss doesn't have to give you a reason.
2239	2241	That's one of the wonderful things about being boss.
2242	2245	Well, I wanted to get off tonight.
2247	2248	I got off all right.
2248	2252	- Kralik, you're not going? - No, I couldn't face her tonight.
2253	2256	This morning I had a position, a future.
2258	2262	I'm afraid I sort of exaggerated in my letters.
2262	2266	I showed off a little, and she's expecting to meet a pretty important man.
2267	2269	I'm in no mood to act important tonight.
2279	2283	Well, I...
2307	2312	My dear Kralik, I think I speak for all of us, when I say this is a shock and a surprise.
2312	2315	We all feel we are losing a splendid fellow worker...
2315	2318	...and we certainly wish you the luck which you so rightfully deserve.
2322	2325	Now, Kralik, we are going to see each other soon.
2325	2329	If you have an evening with nothing to do, you know where we live.
2329	2332	- All right, Pirovitch. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Kralik.
2336	2338	Ilona, I'm going to miss you.
2340	2341	I don't understand.
2341	2345	It's nothing unusual. It happens every day. Somebody gets fired and...
2346	2349	- Goodbye, llona. - Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
2351	2352	Flora.
2352	2355	Flora, you'll notice when you look through my sales book...
2355	2359	...I cancelled slip number five, but I deducted it from the total.
2359	2360	Goodbye.
2368	2372	If I had anything to do with you not getting the evening off, I'm sorry.
2372	2376	It's my fault that you got into this trouble. Believe me, I'm sorry, too.
2376	2377	That's all right.
2377	2379	- It's true we didn't get along. - No.
2379	2382	I guess we fought a lot, but losing a job at a time like this...
2382	2385	...is something you don't wish... - On your worst enemy.
2385	2388	- I didn't say that, Mr. Kralik. - Let's not quarrel anymore.
2389	2392	- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
2406	2407	Yes?
2408	2409	Well?
2412	2413	Oh, you have.
2414	2417	How soon can you come over here?
2418	2420	Yes, well, come right away. I'll... Right.
2421	2423	I'll be waiting here.
2429	2433	You may all go home. We'll finish the windows tomorrow.
2455	2457	- Excuse me. Good night. - Good night.
2479	2481	Hello. Is this Mrs. Hojas?
2481	2484	This is Mr. Pirovitch, Mr. Kralik's friend.
2485	2489	Yes, I know he isn't there yet. Will you, please, tell him when he comes...
2489	2492	...that we are not working tonight, and I am coming over.
2492	2494	Yes. Thank you.
2498	2500	I hope you don't mind, Mr. Matuschek.
2500	2503	He probably feels pretty low tonight, and I thought...
2503	2507	You don't have to explain. What you do after working hours is your own business.
2507	2508	Thank you, sir.
2511	2514	You haven't changed your mind, by any chance, Mr. Matuschek?
2514	2516	You've got the evening off, haven't you? Well, go home.
2517	2520	He is the best man you had. Why did you let him go?
2520	2522	I warn you, Mr. Pirovitch.
2522	2525	His whole life he lived in this shop. He was almost like a son to you.
2526	2528	And you were so proud of him.
2528	2530	You invited him to your home again and again.
2531	2533	Mr. Pirovitch, you want to keep your job, don't you?
2534	2536	Yes, Mr. Matuschek. I have a family.
2537	2538	Two children.
2539	2541	In that case, mind your own business and go home.
2543	2544	Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
2550	2552	- Good night. - Good night.
2552	2553	Good night.
2558	2560	- Good night, Mr. Matuschek. - Good night, vadas.
2561	2562	I beg your pardon.
2562	2565	I'm not quite certain if I delivered Mrs. Matuschek's message.
2565	2570	She told me to remind you to call her if you don't work tonight.
2570	2572	Yes, you told me, vadas.
2574	2578	Mr. Matuschek, the last time I had the pleasure to be at your apartment...
2578	2581	...was several months ago when you sent me after your briefcase.
2581	2585	Today I had a chance to get a glimpse of your new dining room set.
2585	2587	It's exquisite, really.
2587	2591	I can imagine what it'll look like with all the lights on at a dinner party.
2591	2594	- It must be simply stunning. - Thank you, vadas.
2594	2597	- Good night, Mr. Matuschek. - Good night, vadas.
2639	2641	- Good evening, Mr. Matuschek. - Good evening.
2642	2643	Please.
2645	2649	- So it's true? - I'm afraid so, Mr. Matuschek.
2649	2652	Here we have a complete record from our operatives...
2652	2654	...two of our most reliable men.
2654	2656	"Report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek.
2656	2660	"On December 6, Mrs. Matuschek left her residence on vales Street, 23...
2660	2662	"...at 8:45 p.m.
2662	2665	"She walked two blocks up to Karto Street where she engaged a taxi.
2666	2669	"At 9:03, the taxi stopped at the corner of Trantor and Bralter Streets.
2669	2671	"There, Mrs. Matuschek was joined by a young man."
2672	2676	Mr. Matuschek, your suspicion was right. It was one of your employees.
2676	2679	Both our operatives identified him later as Mr. vadas.
2681	2682	- vadas? - Yes.
2684	2687	Ferencz vadas. Danube Place, 56.
2688	2690	There is such a man in your employ, isn't there?
2691	2692	Yes, yes.
2702	2704	Twenty-two years we've been married.
2706	2708	Twenty-two years I was proud of my wife.
2710	2711	Well, she...
2711	2714	...just didn't want to grow old with me.
2715	2718	If you'll send me your bill, I'll take care of it immediately.
2718	2719	Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
2721	2722	- Good night. - Good night.
2748	2749	Good evening.
2757	2758	Hello?
2758	2761	No, Mrs. Matuschek. This is Miss Kaczek speaking.
2762	2764	Good evening. Who?
2764	2767	Pepi? No, Pepi isn't back yet.
2768	2771	I see, Mrs. Matuschek. He did some errands for you.
2772	2774	Oh, you don't say!
2774	2777	He forgot to pick up a bottle of perfume at Chabot's?
2777	2778	Isn't that too bad!
2778	2781	Yes, I'll give a good scolding to the little rascal.
2781	2784	Have a good time, Mrs. Matuschek. Good night.
2805	2808	- Mr. Matuschek! Don't do that! - Go away! Go away!
2808	2810	No, Mr. Matuschek!
2823	2824	Why don't you go in, Kralik?
2825	2827	I really think you should go in and keep your date.
2827	2830	Now, Pirovitch, just do me a favor and deliver my note.
2830	2831	All right.
2832	2835	Pirovitch, I don't want to know what she looks like.
2835	2837	If she's bad looking, I've had enough bad news for today.
2837	2840	If she's lovely, it'll be more difficult, so don't tell me.
2840	2843	No, I won't. Now, what's the name of that book?
2843	2846	- Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy. - Anna Karenina.
2846	2849	- And a red carnation as a bookmark. - Red carnation.
2849	2850	Now, let me see. Just a minute.
2856	2857	- Do you see anything? - Not yet.
2859	2861	- There's a beautiful girl! - Really?
2861	2864	- very beautiful, but no book. - No book.
2866	2868	- Wait a minute. I think I see it. - Yeah?
2868	2870	Right here under the window. Yes.
2872	2876	- "Anna Karenina by Tolstoy." - That's right.
2876	2877	And a carnation.
2879	2882	I can't see her face. She's sitting behind a clothes rack.
2883	2886	- There's a cup of coffee on the table. - Yeah?
2886	2888	She's taking a piece of cake.
2889	2890	Kralik, she is dunking.
2890	2892	- Why shouldn't she dunk? - All right.
2892	2894	- All right. - All right.
2895	2897	She is leaning forward now. She...
2898	2900	- Can you see her? - Yes.
2901	2904	- Is she pretty? - very pretty.
2904	2905	She is?
2907	2909	I should say she looks...
2910	2913	She has a little of the coloring of Klara.
2914	2916	Klara? What, Miss Novak of the shop?
2916	2919	Now, Kralik, you must admit Klara's a very good-looking girl.
2919	2922	Personally, I've always found her a very likeable girl.
2922	2925	This is a fine time to talk about Miss Novak. Now...
2925	2928	If you don't like Miss Novak, I can tell you, you won't like that girl.
2928	2930	- Why? - Because it is Miss Novak.
2949	2950	Now...
2951	2953	...shall I give the note to the waiter? - No.
2955	2957	What do you want to do, let the poor girl wait?
2957	2959	Why shouldn't Miss Novak wait?
2959	2962	For the last six months she's fought with me every day.
2962	2964	But still, she wrote those letters, my friend.
2966	2968	I know. My misfortune.
2970	2972	- Goodbye, Pirovitch. - Goodbye, Kralik.
2973	2974	Thank you.
2980	2984	- Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair? - Oh, no! No, you can't!
2984	2986	I'm expecting somebody. He should be here any minute.
2986	2988	That's all right. That's...
2989	2990	Carnation, huh?
2991	2995	A few nights ago we had a case with roses. Turned out very nice, very nice.
2996	3000	But once, about three months ago, we had a very sad case with gardenias.
3000	3003	She waited all evening and nobody came.
3003	3006	And when we cleaned the café, underneath one of the tables...
3006	3007	...we found another gardenia.
3007	3010	Imagine, the man must've come in...
3010	3013	...taken one look at her, said, "Phooey," and threw away his gardenia.
3014	3017	Is your clock a little fast? My own says 8:27 and yours says 8:31.
3017	3022	Listen, you have nothing to worry about, a pretty girl like you.
3022	3025	If he doesn't come, I'll put on a carnation myself.
3025	3026	- Waiter. - Yes, sir.
3056	3060	- Hello, Miss Novak. - Good evening, Mr. Kralik.
3060	3062	It's quite a coincidence. I had an appointment here, too.
3062	3066	- You haven't seen Mr. Pirovitch by chance? - No, no, I haven't.
3066	3068	All right. Well, I think I'll wait.
3069	3071	- Do you mind if I sit down? - Yes, I do.
3071	3073	You know, I have an appointment, too, Mr. Kralik.
3073	3075	Oh, yes, I remember. Yes.
3077	3081	- My, your friend seems to be a little late. - And I'll thank you not to be sarcastic.
3082	3084	I know you've had a bad day, and you feel very bitter.
3084	3086	- Still, that's no reason... - Bitter? Me?
3086	3088	About leaving Matuschek and Company?
3088	3090	When I got home and sat at the phone...
3090	3092	...in five minutes I had what amounts to two offers.
3092	3095	I congratulate you. I wish you good luck.
3097	3100	I see you're reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
3100	3101	Yes, do you mind?
3101	3104	No, no, I just didn't expect to meet you in a café...
3104	3107	...with Tolstoy, that's all. It's quite a surprise.
3107	3109	I didn't know you cared for high literature.
3109	3112	There are many things you don't know about me, Mr. Kralik.
3114	3117	Have you read Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky?
3118	3120	- No, I haven't. - I have.
3122	3125	There are many things you don't know about me, Miss Novak.
3125	3126	As a matter of fact...
3126	3128	...there might be a lot we don't know about each other.
3129	3132	People seldom go to the trouble of scratching the surface of things...
3132	3133	...to find the inner truth.
3133	3136	I really wouldn't care to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik...
3136	3138	...because I know exactly what I'd find.
3138	3140	Instead of a heart, a handbag.
3141	3143	Instead of a soul, a suitcase.
3144	3148	And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter which doesn't work.
3151	3153	That's very nicely put.
3153	3154	Yes.
3154	3158	Comparing my intellect with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work.
3159	3164	Yeah, that's a very interesting mixture of poetry and meanness.
3164	3165	Meanness? Let me...
3165	3168	Don't misunderstand me. I'm only trying to pay you a compliment.
3168	3172	Mr. Kralik, please! I told you I was expecting somebody.
3173	3175	Look, if your party doesn't show up, would l...
3175	3177	Don't worry about that. My party will show up.
3178	3179	So you don't have to entertain me.
3197	3201	- Have you read Zola's Madame Bovary? - Madame Bovary is not by Zola.
3201	3203	Mr. Kralik, are you still here?
3203	3205	Are you deliberately trying to spoil my evening?
3205	3208	Why do you want to do me harm? Why do you hate me so?
3208	3210	- I don't. - I suppose you love me.
3210	3212	Why should I? What've you done to make me love you?
3212	3214	- I don't want you to love me. - I don't!
3224	3226	Do you know what that tune reminds me of?
3227	3229	Yes, thank you. Two dozen unsold cigarette boxes.
3230	3232	No, no. Wrong again.
3233	3234	It reminds me of a girl out of a job.
3235	3239	- A very nice girl, too, I thought. - You thought that. How you can lie!
3239	3242	But that was before you started to make fun of me...
3242	3244	...and giving imitations of me in the locker room.
3245	3248	And I'd like to take this opportunity, Miss Novak...
3248	3250	...to inform you that I don't walk like a duck...
3250	3252	...and I'm not bowlegged.
3252	3254	- Aren't you? - No, I'm not.
3254	3257	Well, I have information to the contrary.
3257	3260	Mr. vadas assured me that you have your trousers specially made.
3260	3261	That's a lie!
3261	3263	- So that's the kind of a man you trust. - No!
3263	3265	I've never been to a tailor in my life.
3265	3268	If you think I'm bowlegged, I'll pull up my trousers.
3268	3270	Would you like it if made remarks about your red hands?
3270	3273	- That's what you did. - After you started making fun of my legs.
3273	3275	My hands aren't red at all!
3275	3277	No, after I called your attention to them.
3277	3279	Let me tell you something, Miss Novak.
3279	3282	You may have beautiful thoughts, but you hide them.
3282	3285	As far as your actions, you're cold and snippy like an old maid.
3285	3288	You'll have a tough time getting a man to fall in love with you.
3288	3292	An old maid? So, no man could fall in love with me?
3292	3294	Mr. Kralik, you're getting funnier every minute.
3294	3297	I could show you letters that would open your eyes.
3297	3300	No, you probably wouldn't understand what's in them.
3300	3304	They're written by a type of man so far superior to you it isn't even funny.
3305	3308	I have to laugh when I think of you calling me an old maid.
3308	3310	You little insignificant clerk.
3324	3327	- Goodbye, Miss Novak. - Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
3339	3341	Doctor, I would say it's a nervous breakdown.
3341	3342	What do you think?
3343	3345	It appears to be an acute epileptoid manifestation...
3345	3348	...and a pan phobic melancholiac with indication of a neurasthenia cordus.
3348	3350	Is that more expensive than a nervous breakdown?
3350	3352	Pardon me, Mr. Katona.
3352	3355	Precisely what position do you hold with Matuschek and Company?
3355	3357	I would describe myself as a contact man.
3358	3360	I keep contact between Matuschek and the customers...
3361	3362	...on a bicycle.
3363	3364	Do you mean, an errand boy?
3364	3367	Doctor, did I call you a pill-peddler?
3373	3375	- Hello, Mr. Kralik. - How is he?
3375	3378	I want to thank you for your splendid reaction to my call.
3378	3380	- Is it serious? - It was a terrible shock.
3380	3381	I have to get over it.
3381	3385	This thing must be kept in strict confidence between the three of us.
3385	3387	Me, Mr. Matuschek, and you. Here.
3395	3397	Thank you for coming, Kralik.
3398	3400	Sit down.
3405	3408	Do you remember the last time you came to my house for dinner?
3408	3412	I said that if things go well, I might take it easier...
3413	3416	...and maybe by Christmas make you manager of the shop.
3417	3420	Now I have to take it easier.
3423	3426	Would you care to work for me again?
3426	3429	No, don't even think about it, sir.
3430	3433	Is it possible that I ever distrusted you?
3434	3435	I hated you.
3436	3439	I couldn't stand your presence any more.
3439	3442	That's how far jealousy can drive a man.
3442	3443	But that's all over now, sir.
3446	3451	When I first got that anonymous letter, I laughed.
3452	3457	My wife having secret rendezvous with one of my employees.
3458	3459	My wife!
3460	3462	But how could you suspect me, sir?
3463	3467	You see, you were the only one of my employees who had been to my home...
3468	3471	...and you sent my wife flowers... - But that was...
3471	3473	You don't have to tell me.
3474	3477	When that poison gets into a man's mind...
3480	3483	- Just try to understand. - I do understand, sir.
3491	3494	Here are the keys to Matuschek and Company.
3497	3499	Thank you, sir.
3506	3507	What shall I do about Mr...
3507	3512	vadas? I want him dismissed as quietly as possible.
3513	3514	No scandal.
3514	3519	Don't even mention the subject to him. We won't lower ourselves.
3519	3520	very good, sir.
3520	3522	This will be the biggest Christmas in the history...
3522	3524	...of Matuschek and Company.
3524	3526	- I know it will. - Yes, sir. Goodbye.
3528	3529	- Kralik? - Yes, sir?
3530	3535	Now that you're the boss, if you want to give yourself a raise...
3536	3540	I'll talk it over with myself, and if I don't want too much money...
3540	3542	...l'll give it to myself. Thank you, sir!
3543	3545	- Congratulations! - Thank you!
3547	3548	Goodbye, Mr. Matuschek.
3548	3552	Pepi, I don't know how to thank you. You saved my life.
3552	3554	Don't mention it. It was a pleasure.
3554	3556	If you want anything else, you know where to reach me.
3556	3559	I'm still nothing but an errand boy at Matuschek and Company.
3559	3562	In other words, you'd like to be a clerk?
3562	3564	I wouldn't put it that brutally.
3564	3567	- When I get feeling better... - But then you might change your mind.
3567	3569	Who knows how long you'll have to stay here.
3569	3573	You're a pretty sick man, Mr. Matuschek. This isn't just an ordinary breakdown.
3573	3576	All right, you're a clerk. Now, get out of here!
3576	3577	Thanks, Mr. Matuschek!
3589	3592	Kralik, I think I speak for all of us when I say heartiest congratulations.
3593	3597	What a load off my mind. Now we're all one little happy family again.
3597	3600	Be assured of my cooperation to the fullest extent.
3600	3602	I want you to be a great success.
3602	3605	From now on, you're going to the office, aren't you?
3605	3606	That's right.
3606	3608	If anybody deserves it, it's you, my boy.
3608	3609	Nice little ring, isn't it?
3609	3612	I had a little luck last night, too. Real diamond.
3612	3614	My grandma gave it to me.
3614	3616	That's what you get when you're a good boy.
3616	3617	Some get apples, I get diamonds.
3618	3619	- Good one? - Yeah.
3619	3622	By the way, I have some unusual ideas for that window display.
3622	3625	Thank you, vadas. The rest of us can take care of the windows.
3625	3628	Right now, I'd like you to go into the stockroom...
3628	3630	...and you know those big suitcases on the top shelf?
3630	3633	- The black ones? - That's right, and the big brown suitcases.
3633	3635	- On the bottom shelf? - On the bottom.
3635	3639	I want you to take all the big black suitcases from the top shelf...
3639	3641	...and move them to the bottom, and the big brown ones...
3641	3644	...from the bottom shelf and move them to the top shelf.
3644	3647	- You don't want to do it? - I didn't say that. Of course I'll do it.
3647	3650	- I'm a good soldier. - All right, do it right away.
3653	3653	Thank you.
3670	3672	312-683, please.
3673	3675	Is this the Atlas Employment Agency?
3675	3678	This is Mr. Katona of Matuschek and Company speaking.
3678	3681	We have an opening for a new errand boy. Now see here.
3681	3685	I want a educated, healthy boy, good family and no bad habits.
3686	3689	Send me four or five. I'll look them over. Right away, if you please.
3689	3692	Tell them to ask for Mr. Katona, the sales department.
3692	3693	All right.
3694	3697	What's the matter, didn't you ever see a clerk before?
3697	3700	- Who made you a clerk? - Yes, who did this dreadful thing?
3701	3704	I can't give you the whole story. I'm tied up with my word of honor.
3704	3708	If it hadn't been for me, this place would be closed on account of suicide...
3708	3710	...and you'd all be out of a job.
3711	3714	Matuschek and Company, good morning. Yes, Mrs. Matuschek.
3715	3717	Don't miss this, folks.
3718	3720	Hello, Mrs. Matuschek.
3721	3723	Yes, this is Pepi speaking.
3724	3725	That's right.
3726	3728	I didn't bring you that bottle of perfume?
3729	3731	Well, you're never going to get it! What do you think of that?
3732	3734	Your perfume days are over, Mrs. M!
3735	3737	Yes! This is Pepi speaking.
3738	3741	You want to speak to Mr. Matuschek? That's too bad.
3742	3745	At the moment he's up in a balloon with two blondes.
3745	3746	Now watch this.
3747	3750	You wouldn't like to speak by any chance to Mr. vadas?
3753	3755	That got her. Draw your own conclusions.
3761	3762	You sent for me, chief?
3764	3766	vadas, I'm a little worried about you.
3766	3769	Will you be comfortable under a former, fellow clerk?
3769	3771	Working under a younger man?
3771	3774	Kralik, this is the age of youth, and I always ride with the times.
3774	3776	You're a smart young man and my hat's off to you.
3776	3779	Let's stop beating around the bush. You and I never got along.
3779	3781	- You really think so? - Admit it. You don't like me.
3781	3785	I don't? Wait a minute, Kralik. You are the boss.
3785	3787	That's right, but I'm not going to be a "yes" man.
3787	3789	You know what I'll do? I'm going to contradict you.
3789	3791	I do like you!
3791	3794	- Anything else bothering you? - Yes. I don't like you.
3795	3798	That's every man's privilege. I thank you for being so frank.
3799	3802	Now I know my problem, and it's up to me to change your mind.
3802	3805	I don't think it'll be so hard.
3805	3807	I heard the funniest joke. Do you want to hear it?
3807	3808	No!
3810	3810	Hello!
3811	3813	Yes, this is Matuschek and Company.
3814	3815	Johanna?
3816	3818	You're calling for Miss Novak.
3819	3822	What's the matter with her? I hope it's nothing serious.
3823	3826	Fine, I'm glad to hear that. Tell her not to worry.
3826	3829	Unless she's absolutely all right, tell her not to come today.
3829	3831	No, there's no hurry now.
3831	3834	Tell her to be sure and take good care of herself. All right.
3834	3838	- Really, Kralik, that's a wonderful attitude. - What's so wonderful about it?
3838	3840	I've been around, and I have my eyes open.
3840	3843	If anyone didn't agree with you here, it was Miss Novak.
3843	3845	Just leave Miss Novak out of this.
3845	3847	Don't misunderstand. I have nothing against Miss Novak.
3848	3851	On the contrary, she's a nice girl. Only sometimes, she went too far.
3851	3855	Not another word about Miss Novak. She's a fine girl and a hard worker...
3855	3857	...and she's a good salesgirl, and you shut up!
3858	3860	You misunderstand me. I didn't mean any offense.
3860	3863	- I was agreeing with you. - I don't want you to agree with me!
3863	3864	You're fired.
3865	3868	You're fired. Get out of here, you two-faced, double-crossing...
3868	3870	...two-timer! Go on. Get out of here!
3870	3872	Folks! Folks!
3872	3873	Folks!
3873	3877	Did you hear what he called me? Remember it on the witness stand.
3877	3879	He called me a double-crossing two-timer!
3879	3882	I told you to get out of here! Get out!
3883	3884	Don't you push. Don't you push!
3885	3887	What right have you got to fire me? Does Mr. Matuschek know?
3887	3890	No! Mr. Matuschek doesn't know anything about this.
3890	3892	I'm the manager, and you don't work here anymore!
3892	3896	How do I know you're the manager? Prove it to me in black and white.
3897	3899	You're going to get it in black and blue.
3910	3913	All right! Nice little case of assault and battery.
3914	3916	You'll hear from my lawyer. What about my salary?
3916	3918	Get the man's salary.
3919	3921	- Here it is, Mr. vadas. - We have everything prepared.
3921	3925	- We don't want to waste any time. - Pardon me, sir. Your garments.
3926	3928	I'm entitled to a letter of reference.
3928	3930	I forgot it. Flora, take a letter.
3930	3935	To whom it may concern: Mr. vadas has been in the employ...
3935	3938	...of Matuschek and Company for two years during which time he's been efficient...
3938	3941	...as a stool pigeon, a troublemaker, and a rat.
3941	3943	If he doesn't clear out, he'll get a punch in the nose.
3943	3946	Truly, Alfred Kralik, Manager of Matuschek and Company.
3984	3986	- Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Novak.
3988	3990	I suppose you're surprised to see me back.
3991	3995	Naturally. I'm glad you have your job back again. I congratulate you.
3995	3996	I hear you haven't been feeling well.
3996	4001	That's all right, thank you. I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek.
4005	4008	Here he is. I'm Mr. Matuschek.
4008	4010	Mr. Kralik, don't make any jokes. Not today.
4011	4013	Please, if you want to pick on me, do it some other time.
4014	4016	I don't know what to say.
4017	4020	I'm trying to tell you that Mr. Matuschek isn't here, and that I'm the manager.
4021	4024	Haven't you got any heart at all? I'm not well, I can hardly see straight.
4024	4027	Everything is just going round and round.
4027	4032	I ask you a simple question and instead of any consideration, you try to frighten me.
4034	4035	Excuse me.
4038	4039	Hello.
4041	4041	Mr. Foeldes?
4042	4043	Hello, Mr. Foeldes.
4044	4046	Yes. Well, thank you very much.
4046	4048	Yes, it all happened this morning.
4049	4051	That's right, Mr. Foeldes.
4051	4053	No, Mr. Matuschek won't be with us for a while.
4055	4059	Now, please, Mr. Foeldes. I don't own the shop yet.
4059	4060	I'm only the manager.
4061	4064	Goodbye, Mr...
4064	4065	Miss Novak! Klara! Klara!
4074	4076	- Good evening, Miss Novak. - Good evening, Mr. Kralik.
4077	4079	I hope you'll forgive this intrusion, but I...
4080	4085	Being in charge of the shop, I feel like a father to our little family.
4087	4090	Anyway, how are you, young lady?
4091	4095	I'll be all right, Mr. Kralik. Please sit down.
4095	4096	Thank you.
4100	4104	Christmas is coming, and we'll miss a good worker like you in the shop.
4104	4106	So you better get well.
4106	4108	I'll be all right in a day or two.
4108	4110	That doesn't mean that you should neglect yourself.
4111	4112	I'm very serious about this...
4112	4116	...because I feel responsible for the whole thing.
4116	4117	- You? - Yes.
4117	4121	Oh, no, Mr. Kralik. I think I can relieve your mind.
4121	4123	It wasn't your fault at all.
4123	4128	No, there's a much bigger reason, unfortunately.
4129	4130	Shouldn't you call a doctor?
4131	4133	No, I don't need to see a doctor.
4133	4136	My trouble is what one might call...
4136	4137	...psychological.
4139	4143	It's my own personal problem, and I'll come out of it.
4144	4148	I'm sorry. It's a shame you have to go through all this.
4149	4151	As long as it's only psychological, you won't...
4152	4153	Only psychological!
4155	4158	Mr. Kralik, it's true we're in the same room...
4159	4161	...but we're not on the same planet.
4164	4169	Miss Novak, although I'm the victim of your remark...
4169	4173	...I can't help but admire the exquisite way you have of expressing yourself.
4176	4179	You certainly know how to put a man in his planet.
4179	4181	Aunt Anna has something for you!
4181	4184	She has? Why doesn't she come in? Come in, Aunt Anna!
4186	4189	This is Mr. Kralik of Matuschek and Company.
4189	4191	- I'm glad to meet you. - How do you do?
4191	4193	- I hope it's good news. - I'll tell you later.
4196	4200	Mr. Kralik, it was kind of you to drop in.
4200	4202	I don't want to spoil your whole evening.
4202	4205	I have nothing to do. Go ahead and read the letter.
4205	4206	Don't worry about me.
4207	4208	- Lf you don't mind. - Not at all.
4233	4235	- Good news? - very good news.
4236	4239	I can promise you I'll be back in the shop tomorrow, and I'll be on my toes!
4240	4242	I'll sell more goods than ever before.
4243	4247	That's quite a change in you. It's amazing what one letter can do.
4247	4249	If I weren't feeling so happy, I'd be very annoyed with you.
4250	4252	With me? Why?
4252	4255	Why? Because you spoiled my date last night.
4255	4258	I wasn't so wrong when I asked you not to sit at my table.
4258	4260	This gentleman did come to the café.
4260	4263	He looked in the window, saw us together, and misunderstood.
4264	4267	- He thought you and I were friends? - He must have. Listen.
4269	4272	"Tell me and be frank. I think you owe it to me.
4272	4277	"Who is this very attractive young man? He's just the type women fall for."
4283	4287	- I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble. - It's all right. I'll straighten it out.
4287	4289	It won't hurt him to be a little jealous.
4292	4295	He doesn't seem to be much of a man, this friend of yours.
4295	4296	I mean, he walks away.
4296	4299	He's afraid to come over to the table when another man is there.
4299	4303	No, Mr. Kralik, he's wasn't afraid, I can assure you.
4303	4305	He's tactful. He's sensitive.
4305	4309	He's not the type of man who would walk up to a table uninvited.
4309	4312	It's difficult to explain a man like him to a man like you.
4313	4316	Where you would say, "black," he would say, "white."
4316	4319	Where you would say, "ugly," he says, "beautiful."
4320	4323	And when you say, "old maid," he says:
4325	4328	"Eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery...
4330	4331	"vivacious.
4333	4335	"Fascinating."
4338	4340	I remind him of gypsy music.
4342	4346	Speaking of gypsy music, we've had a lot of trouble...
4346	4348	...selling those Ochi Tchornya boxes, haven't we?
4348	4351	- That doesn't make any difference. - You can consider one box sold.
4351	4355	Yes. I've just had an inspiration. I'll give one to my friend for Christmas.
4356	4358	Miss Novak, you're taking an awful chance.
4359	4363	Why don't you give him a wallet? I'm sure he'd be crazy about it.
4363	4368	Any man would be. A wallet is practical. Besides, we have those imported pigskins.
4368	4371	- I'm not interested. - I'd make you a special price.
4371	4372	No, I'm sorry.
4373	4376	Besides being a practical thing...
4376	4379	...a wallet is quite romantic.
4380	4383	On one side he has your last letter, on the other side, a picture of you.
4385	4386	When he opens it, there you are.
4387	4389	And that's all the music he wants.
4391	4394	Why, Mr. Kralik, you surprise me.
4395	4398	That's very well-expressed.
4399	4401	I must admit, that's very nice.
4402	4405	No, just the same, I'm going to give him a cigarette box.
4409	4411	There's not much more I can say.
4411	4413	Except that I wish both of you a Merry Christmas.
4413	4416	- Thank you, Mr. Kralik, good night. - Good night, Miss Novak.
4428	4430	- Rudy! - Yes, Mr. Katona?
4431	4432	Do you know what time it is?
4432	4434	- A few minutes after 8:00. - And you're still here?
4434	4437	- Don't contradict me, just listen! - Yes, Mr. Katona.
4437	4441	You have to be faster, especially on Christmas Eve.
4442	4443	Am I asking too much?
4443	4445	- No, Mr. Katona. - All right.
4449	4450	I have great news.
4450	4453	I talked to the hospital, and Mr. Matuschek is much better.
4453	4456	- That's wonderful! - Can we visit him?
4456	4458	Let's all get together and buy him a nice Christmas present.
4459	4461	Let's get him a little Christmas tree for his hospital room.
4462	4466	That's all very nice, but the best present we could give him is a bare-looking shop...
4466	4468	...with nothing in it except money in the cash register.
4469	4469	Now, come on, folks!
4470	4473	Let's make this the biggest Christmas Eve in the history of Matuschek and Company.
4474	4477	Where's Klara! Klara! Miss Novak!
4477	4479	Coming! Yes, Mr. Kralik, what is it?
4480	4482	- How are you today? - Fine.
4482	4486	Good. We're expecting terrific business today. It's going to be tough.
4486	4487	But don't overdo it.
4499	4502	Miss Novak, may I ask a favor of you?
4502	4504	With pleasure, Mr. Pirovitch.
4504	4508	I wanted to buy one of those Ochi Tchornya boxes, but Kralik tells me...
4508	4511	...you took the only one that really works.
4511	4515	That's right. I bought it for my boyfriend.
4517	4520	He's coming tonight. We're going to celebrate Christmas Eve.
4522	4526	- Mr. Pirovitch, can you keep a secret? - On my word of honor.
4526	4530	When I come back Monday, I might have a ring on my finger.
4531	4532	Maybe, you never know.
4533	4534	What? That's wonderful!
4534	4538	And that's the young man who'll get the cigarette box?
4538	4539	Then let's drop the whole thing.
4539	4542	You see, I thought of giving it to my wife's uncle for Christmas.
4542	4544	I'm sorry, can't you give him something else?
4545	4548	It's not so easy. You see, I don't like him.
4548	4552	I hate to spend a nickel on him. Still, I must give him a present.
4552	4554	I thought if I have to give him a present...
4554	4557	...I might as well give him something he won't enjoy.
4557	4558	The box costs 2.29.
4558	4562	That's a lot of money, but it's worth it to ruin my wife's uncle's Christmas.
4565	4569	I'm sorry, Miss Novak. I forgot you always liked those.
4570	4572	No, no, Mr. Pirovitch. Speak freely.
4573	4576	If you were in my position...
4576	4578	...what would you give him?
4578	4580	That's hard to say.
4581	4583	What would you say to the idea of...
4584	4586	...let's say, maybe, a wallet?
4587	4589	That's an inspiration.
4589	4593	- One of those imported pigskins? - That's what I was thinking of.
4594	4595	You can't miss.
4595	4598	If I would get such a wallet, I would be...
4598	4601	...one of the happiest men in the world.
4601	4604	On one side... Here, I'll show you.
4605	4607	On one side, I put a picture of my wife...
4607	4610	...and on the other side, my little baby.
4610	4616	When I open it, it says, "Papa" and not "Ochi Tchornya."
4617	4620	Thank you, Mr. Pirovitch. I'll think it over.
4624	4626	Kralik, you'll get the wallet.
4668	4671	Mr. Matuschek, what are doing here? Since when are you back?
4671	4675	I'm supposed to be a pretty sick man, that's what my doctor tells me.
4676	4679	But after all, it's Christmas Eve. I couldn't stay away any longer.
4680	4682	Can you imagine me, over two weeks in the hospital...
4682	4684	...without seeing a single customer?
4684	4687	The only piece of leather goods in the place was my nurse's handbag.
4688	4691	And where do you think she got it? At Blasek and Company!
4691	4693	And they expect me to get well?
4693	4697	- Have you been by Blasek and Company? - Oh, yes.
4697	4701	- What kind of business are they doing? - They're busy, but no comparison with this.
4702	4703	Good. This is all right.
4703	4707	Mr. Matuschek, take it easy. Don't overdo.
4707	4710	No, I'm not, don't be. I'm not a fool.
4710	4714	I came around to find out if the shop was still here. And then I go.
4714	4717	- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek. - Same to you.
4717	4721	- Do you think Eric would like that briefcase? - I don't know. I'm not so sure.
4722	4726	Pardon me, ladies. I can't see very well without my glasses.
4726	4728	Could you tell me the price on that briefcase?
4729	4730	24.50.
4730	4734	24.50! My, what values you get here.
4734	4737	I wonder how Matuschek and Company can do it.
4737	4740	If you don't know, Mr. Matuschek, who should?
4749	4751	How much is it?
4754	4757	9,654.75.
4757	4758	That's wonderful.
4759	4764	That's the biggest day since '28. You should be very proud.
4764	4767	I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
4768	4771	Two hours ago when I walked in here, I was a sick man.
4771	4776	But you, Kralik, and you, Pirovitch, you're the best doctors.
4776	4781	And you, Klara and llona and Flora, you're wonderful nurses.
4781	4782	Thank you.
4783	4785	Pepi, you know what I think about you.
4786	4787	Yes, sir.
4788	4793	This morning when I received the little Christmas tree you all sent me...
4793	4795	...I was deeply moved.
4796	4798	I read your little note over and over.
4798	4802	And it made me very happy that you missed me...
4802	4805	...and hoped that I'd be coming back home soon again.
4807	4810	You're right, this is my home.
4811	4814	This is where I spent most of my life.
4816	4819	No Christmas is complete without a bonus.
4823	4825	- Kralik. - Thank you, sir.
4826	4827	Klara.
4829	4831	- Pepi. - Thank you, sir.
4832	4834	Flora. Here.
4836	4839	- Ilona. - Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
4839	4841	And Pirovitch.
4842	4847	I've called you names on several occasions.
4847	4850	When you see the bonus, you'll realize that I didn't mean it.
4851	4853	Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
4854	4856	I guess that's about all.
4857	4859	Here, what's your name?
4860	4861	Rudy.
4861	4863	- Well, Rudy. - Good boy.
4866	4867	Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
4868	4869	It's all right, Rudy.
4871	4872	Too much.
4873	4876	We'll leave the shop just as it is until after the holiday.
4876	4879	I want you all to go home now and have a very Merry Christmas.
4880	4882	Thank you.
4884	4886	Well, Kralik...
4886	4890	...9,654.75.
4891	4893	That's wonderful.
4894	4895	Thank you, Flora.
4905	4906	Well, I think I'll have a...
4906	4910	...little dinner now, and celebrate Christmas.
4910	4912	Have you ever been to Biro's?
4912	4915	No sir, I'm afraid that's way over my head.
4915	4919	Christmas only comes once a year. How about joining me...
4920	4922	...and we'll break a bottle of champagne together?
4922	4927	- Mr. Matuschek, I'd love nothing more... - You have another engagement?
4928	4932	No, not another word. I wanted to be sure that you weren't alone.
4933	4936	Have a wonderful time, and Merry Christmas.
4936	4937	The same to you, sir.
4952	4953	Well, Pirovitch.
4954	4957	I presume you're going to have a nice party at your house tonight.
4957	4959	Yes, I should say.
4961	4963	You probably have some guests?
4963	4967	No, just my wife, my boy, and my little baby and myself.
4968	4970	That's all we want, and we are very happy.
4971	4974	- Well, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
4983	4986	- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek. - Thank you, Flora.
4986	4989	- Please, give my regards to your mother. - Thank you.
4992	4996	Still hanging around the shop, Mr. Matuschek? Can't get away from here.
4997	4999	You'd better hurry home, son.
4999	5002	You're probably celebrating Christmas with your family. Am I wrong?
5003	5005	Yes, Mr. Matuschek. See that girl over there on the corner?
5006	5007	- Yeah. - I'm her Santa Claus.
5008	5010	- Good night, Mr. Matuschek. - Good night.
5015	5018	Mr. Matuschek, I don't know how to thank you for that marvelous present.
5019	5021	After all, I'm only working here a short time.
5021	5024	That's all right. What was your name?
5024	5026	Rudy.
5026	5028	- How old are you, Rudy? - 17.
5028	5031	That's a wonderful age. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
5031	5034	- It's up to you what you make of it. - Yes, sir.
5034	5038	You better not squander that money. Go home and give it to your mother.
5038	5041	- My people don't live here in town. - Is that so?
5042	5044	- Have you no other relations here? - No, Mr. Matuschek.
5045	5048	You're all alone in Budapest on Christmas Eve?
5048	5049	That's right.
5050	5054	Rudy! Do you like chicken noodle soup?
5054	5056	I certainly do.
5056	5060	And what would you think of roast goose stuffed with baked apples?
5061	5064	And fresh boiled potatoes and butter and some red cabbage on the side?
5065	5066	I'd love it!
5066	5069	And then cucumber salad with sour cream?
5071	5074	Then a double order of apple strudel with vanilla sauce.
5075	5076	Sounds wonderful!
5076	5079	You're going to have it, Rudy. Come on. Here, taxi!
5082	5085	- It's lovely, I'm sure he'll like it. - I think so, too.
5085	5089	Merry Christmas, Klara. I hope it all turns out the way you want it to.
5089	5091	- Thanks, llona. - Good night.
5100	5103	- I'm sorry, I'll be out in a second. - That's all right, no hurry.
5106	5109	I decided to follow your advice after all.
5111	5112	Want to see something?
5128	5129	That's beautiful.
5130	5132	Why don't you try it on?
5132	5135	I'd like to see what it looks like on a girl.
5142	5144	- Are those real diamonds? - They're pretty near.
5149	5151	I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
5151	5154	Yes, it probably isn't easy for you to imagine anyone...
5154	5156	...could like a man of my type.
5157	5159	Let's not start all over again.
5159	5163	It's Christmas, and I'd like to be friends. Beside, you're wrong.
5164	5168	- Do you mind if I tell you something? - No, not at all.
5168	5172	When I first came to work here, something very strange happened to me.
5173	5175	I got psychologically mixed up.
5176	5177	- You don't say? - Yes.
5177	5179	I found myself looking at you again and again.
5179	5182	I just couldn't take my eyes off of you.
5182	5187	I kept saying, "Klara Novak, what on earth is the matter with you.
5187	5189	"This Kralik is not a particularly attractive man."
5189	5192	- I hope you don't mind. - No, not at all.
5192	5195	Now, here comes the paradox. I found myself falling for you.
5195	5198	- I can't believe it. - Yes, and very much so.
5198	5201	- You certainly didn't show it. - In those first few weeks...
5201	5205	I know you won't misconstrue what I'm going to say to you.
5205	5208	After all, I'm happily engaged. At least it looks that way.
5208	5209	Go on.
5209	5213	In those first few weeks, there were moments in the stockroom...
5214	5217	...when you could have swept me off of my feet.
5219	5221	Now I'm getting psychologically mixed up.
5222	5225	I was a different girl, then. I was rather naive.
5226	5229	All my knowledge came from books, and I'd just finished a novel...
5229	5233	...about a glamorous French actress from the Comédie Française.
5233	5235	That's a theater in France.
5235	5238	When she wanted to arouse a man's interest, she treated him like a dog.
5239	5240	Yes, you treated me like a dog.
5240	5243	But instead of licking my hand, you barked.
5245	5249	My mistake was I didn't realize that the difference between this glamorous lady...
5249	5252	...and me was that she was with the Comédie Française...
5252	5254	...and I was with Matuschek and Company.
5254	5257	Well, that's all forgotten now.
5257	5260	Now you're going to see your girlfriend. By the way, is it serious?
5261	5262	Yes, very.
5263	5267	Maybe we'll both be engaged Monday morning.
5268	5269	I think we will.
5269	5272	Don't misunderstand me. I just said in my case, it might happen.
5273	5276	As a matter of fact, I can tell you, it will happen.
5278	5280	How do you know?
5280	5282	We won't go into that.
5289	5291	Mr. Kralik, what do you mean you know?
5291	5294	I guess I might as well tell you. He came to see me.
5294	5296	- Who? - Your fiancée.
5297	5299	Yes, he came last night. You shouldn't have told him who I am.
5300	5301	I spent an uncomfortable hour.
5301	5305	Apparently, he didn't believe it when you wrote that I meant nothing to you.
5305	5308	I can't get it into my head. Coming to see you?
5309	5312	- That doesn't sound like him at all. - I've straightened everything out.
5313	5316	You don't have to worry. In a little while you'll be Mrs. Popkin.
5318	5319	Mrs. Popkin?
5320	5323	That's the name, isn't it? That's the name he gave me.
5323	5326	Oh, yes, that's right. Popkin. Popkin.
5326	5330	A very nice fellow. I congratulate you.
5331	5332	Thank you.
5334	5338	I think he's a very attractive man, don't you?
5339	5343	Yes. For his type, I'd say yes.
5344	5347	You would classify him as a definite type?
5348	5351	Absolutely! And don't try to change him.
5352	5354	Don't put him on a diet.
5355	5359	- Would you call him fat? - I wouldn't, but that's a matter of opinion.
5359	5363	I think that little stomach of his gives him a nice, homey quality.
5363	5365	That's what you want in a husband, isn't it?
5365	5369	- Yes, that's what I want. - And you're perfectly right.
5369	5373	If I were a girl and had to choose between a young, good-for-nothing...
5373	5375	...with plenty of hair, and a solid, mature citizen...
5375	5377	...l'd pick Mathias Popkin every time.
5380	5383	Anyway, he has a fine mind.
5383	5386	Didn't he impress you as being rather witty?
5386	5390	He struck me as rather depressed, but it's unfair to judge a man...
5390	5391	...when he's out of a job.
5391	5393	Out of a job! He never told me!
5393	5395	That shows you how sensitive he is.
5395	5397	You have nothing to worry about.
5397	5400	He feels that both of you can live very nicely on your salary.
5403	5406	Did you tell him how much I make?
5406	5408	He's your fiancée, and he asked me.
5409	5413	When I told him what salary you made, he was a little worried...
5413	5416	...but then I promised him you'd get a raise, and he felt better about it.
5417	5420	Let me tell you, mentioning that bonus didn't do you any harm at all.
5421	5422	This is terrible.
5423	5428	I'm outraged! I had no idea he was materialistic like this.
5428	5433	If you could read his letters. Such ideals, such a lofty point of view.
5434	5437	- I could quote you passages. - For instance?
5439	5442	"True love is to be two, and yet one.
5443	5447	"A man and a woman blended as angels.
5447	5450	"Heaven itself." That's victor Hugo. He stole that.
5457	5461	I thought I was the inspiration for all those beautiful thoughts.
5462	5465	Now I find he was just copying words out of a book.
5467	5469	He probably didn't mean a single one of them.
5473	5476	I'm sorry you feel this way about it.
5476	5479	I'd hate to think I'm spoiling your Christmas.
5480	5485	I'd built up such an illusion about him. I thought he was so perfect.
5486	5489	I had to come along and destroy it.
5489	5491	That's all right.
5493	5495	I guess I really ought to thank you.
5497	5501	Klara, if I'd only known in the beginning how you felt about me...
5501	5503	...things would have been different.
5503	5506	We wouldn't have been fighting all the time.
5506	5510	If we quarreled, it wouldn't have been over suitcases and handbags...
5510	5513	...but over something like whether your aunt or grandmother...
5513	5515	...should live with us or not.
5520	5523	It's sweet of you to try to cheer me up.
5524	5527	I think we'd better say good night.
5528	5533	You have an engagement and so have l, and we shouldn't be late.
5535	5537	Do you know what I wish would happen?
5537	5540	When your bell rings at 8:30, and you open the door...
5540	5542	...instead of Popkin, I come in.
5543	5545	Please, don't make it more difficult for me.
5545	5547	- I'd say, "Klara, darling"... - No, you mustn't.
5547	5550	My dearest, sweetheart Klara, I can't stand it any longer.
5551	5553	Take your key and open post office box 237...
5553	5555	...and take me out of my envelope and kiss me.
5555	5557	Mr. Kralik, you must...
5573	5575	Dear friend.
5577	5578	You?
5580	5581	Dear friend?
5585	5587	Are you disappointed?
5593	5596	Psychologically, I'm very confused...
5600	5603	...but personally, I don't feel bad at all.
5605	5606	Klara.
5610	5615	When you came to the café that night, I was pretty rude, wasn't I?
5615	5618	- Oh, no. No. - Yes, I was. Don't you remember?
5619	5621	Why, I called you bowlegged.
5622	5624	I was going to prove to you that I wasn't.
5625	5628	I was going to go out to the street and pull up my trousers.
5628	5632	Would you mind very much if I asked you to pull them up now?
