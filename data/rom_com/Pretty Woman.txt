15	18	Broke in right on the two of them.
18	21	No matter what they say, it's all about money.
21	25	So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan officer. Watch.
25	28	One, two, three. See?
28	30	You've got it all, and we've got nothin'.
30	32	- And you have all four. Take a look. - Oh!
32	34	But I wouldn't trust you with real gold.
34	36	- That's why this one's only worth about a penny. - Hmm.
37	39	And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.
39	42	A penny from the ear. How much for the rest?
42	44	- Have you seen Edward? - No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.
44	47	My wife went to a lot of trouble; she called a caterer.
47	49	- Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you? - Philip, good.
49	51	Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse Industries.
51	53	- Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan. - Can I get in on it?
53	55	- Yeah. Call me. - When?
55	57	Just call me.
57	60	- Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer. - Where's the guest of honor?
60	63	He's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady.
63	65	How are you?
65	68	I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she call you?
68	72	Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you.
72	75	- I see. - I have my own life too, you know, Edward.
75	78	This is a very important week for me. I need you here.
78	83	But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at your beck and call.
83	86	I do not believe that you are at my beck and call.
86	88	Well, that's the way you always make me feel.
88	90	- Maybe I should just move out. - If that's what you want, yes.
91	93	All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.
93	95	- Now is as good a time as any. - That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.
95	97	Good-bye, Jessica.
103	106	- Phil suggested that maybe I should take a I- - Phil is just my lawyer, okay?
106	109	- Yes, sir. - How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei?
109	112	- I don't know. - You don't know? Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.
112	114	- You have to keep on top of these things, all right? - Done.
114	116	- Hello, Mr. Lewis. - Hi. How you doin'? I want this whole thing...
116	119	wrapped up as soon as possible; I gotta get to New York by Sunday.
119	121	- I got tickets to the Met. - Yes, sir.
122	124	- Your coat, Mr. Lewis. - Thank you.
124	127	- Edward! - Susan!
127	129	- Hi. - Hi.
129	131	- I was sorry to hear about Carter. - Oh, yeah. Thanks.
132	136	- Heard you got married. - Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you!
136	139	Mmm. Susan, tell me something.
139	142	- Yes? - When you and I were dating,
142	145	did you speak to my secretary more than you spoke to me?
146	148	She was one of my bridesmaids.
148	153	Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.
153	155	- Bye. - Thanks, bye.
155	157	- Do you? - Absolutely.
157	159	- Wonderful. - He's leaving. Edward's leaving.
159	162	- Excuse me. - Sure.
162	165	Is this Mr. Stuckey's car?
166	168	Edward, where you goin'?
168	171	- You got the keys to your car? - Why, what's wrong with the limo?
171	173	Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it out.
173	175	- Mmm. - Please give me the keys. - All right, look.
176	178	I don't think you should drive. You're a little excited. Don't drive my car.
178	181	Let me work something out here. Fellas, what kind of a system is this?
181	183	Can you move these cars out of here? Look, Edward.
183	186	- Edward. Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift? - Uh, yeah.
186	188	- Have you driven a shift? Listen, all right. - Yeah. Yeah.
188	190	Just be ginger with it. It's a new car.
190	192	- Don't, uh- Just don't- - Okay. I can do it.
192	194	Edward! Give me a break, please!
194	197	- I love this car. - I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going.
197	199	You're gonna get lost in the dark!
199	203	Beverly Hills is down the hill!
206	209	# I don't need to fall at your feet #
209	213	# Just 'cause you cut me to the bone #

480	483	# Don't be cruel Show me your soul ##
483	485	Yo, Viv!
485	488	- Is it all gone? - Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.
488	491	- This is Angel. That's the Dude. - I know everybody! Is it all gone, Kit?
491	495	Carlos sold me some great shit. We just had this party. I was the hostess.
495	498	I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is goin' on with you, Kit?
498	501	I needed a little pick-me-up.
501	503	- Well, we need rent money! - Oh, calm down, chica.
503	505	- She only owes me 200 more. - Carlos!
505	507	- Another $200? - That was from way before.
507	511	That's right, 200, Vivian. But if you wanna work off her money with me,
511	515	- we can work something out. - That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.
515	517	- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs. - Work out- Work out what?
517	520	- What are we gonna work out? - You really like her, Carlos?
521	523	You took it while I was sleeping?
523	525	- You were unavailable for consultation. - Hey, let's go.
525	528	Snack! Snack!
528	532	- Besides, it's my apartment. - Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.
532	535	Look, you came here; I gave you some money; I gave you a place to stay...
535	537	and some valuable vocational advice.
537	539	He was on my case. I had to give him something.
539	541	So don't irritate me.
541	545	- This ain't a buffet, Kit. - Irritate you?
545	549	Irritate you? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster.
549	553	I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a- a flake.
553	556	She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months.
556	560	Leave her alone!
560	562	Don't you want to get outta here?
562	566	Get outta where? Where the fuck you wanna go?
566	569	Aah, nothin' but garbage.
569	571	- Uh, excuse me. - Huh?
571	574	- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? - You're here!
574	578	That's Sylvester Stallone's house right there.
578	580	- Thank you. - You're welcome.
582	585	- Hey, yo, Rachel. - What?
585	588	- Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe? - Yeah.
588	592	Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers,
592	595	we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald.
595	598	This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner.
599	602	Forgive me. I was just takin' a rest here. Besides, she's new.
602	606	Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.
606	608	- Williams. - Esther Williams! Where you belong!
608	612	Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.
612	615	- Am I really a grouch? - Yes.
615	617	Sometimes.
617	621	Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat.
621	624	- Hey, girls. - Hey, yo, baby!
624	626	How about a freebie? It's my birthday.
626	628	Dream on!
630	632	It's lookin' really slow tonight.
633	638	Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.
638	641	And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.
641	645	You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.
647	650	- Do you think I look like Carol Channing? - No! I love this look.
650	654	It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.
654	656	Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this!
659	661	Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.
663	667	No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight.
667	671	Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you.
671	674	Take care of you.
676	679	Work it. Work it, baby. Work it!
679	682	Work it. Own it.
683	685	Yes, you can handle this.
685	688	First is here somewhere.
688	691	Hey, sugar, you lookin' for a date?
691	694	No, I wanna find Beverly Hills. Can you give me directions?
694	696	Sure. For five bucks.
696	700	- Ridiculous. - Price just went up to ten.
701	703	You can't charge me for directions.
703	706	I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.
711	713	All right, okay?
713	716	All right. You win, I lose. Got change for a 20?
716	720	For 20, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the stars live.
720	725	- Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's. - Right. Uh, down the street.
725	728	- What, you forget? I told you no dates tonight. - Go.
728	733	- Let's go. - Hey, where you goin', baby? Vivian!
733	737	Lights! Lights would be good here.
737	740	I guess this is not the greatest time to be a hooker, is it?
740	744	Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.
744	748	Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer.
748	751	I like that. That's very good.
751	754	Should have that printed on your business card.
754	757	- If you're makin' fun of me, I don't like it. - No, I'm not making fun of you.
757	761	No, I'm not makin'- I'm not. I wouldn't offend you. I'm sorry.
761	764	What's your name?
764	767	What do you want it to be?
768	772	- Vivian. My name is Vivian. - Vivian.
774	777	- So, what hotel you stayin' at? - The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.
777	780	Down the block, right at the corner.
785	790	Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails!
790	792	I beg your pardon?
792	795	Well, doesn't it blow your mind? This is only four cylinders.
795	798	- You know about cars. Where did that come from?
798	801	Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with,
801	804	they were really into American heavy metal: Mustangs, Corvettes.
804	807	- Ah. - They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up. I paid attention.
807	809	So how is it you know so little about cars?
809	812	My first car was a limousine.
812	815	- Oh. - So where is this...
815	819	heavy metal... home?
819	822	Millage Ville, Georgia.
822	824	You know, I think you left your transmission back there.
824	827	- You're not shifting right. This is a standard "H."
827	829	Standard "H." Like I know what that means.
829	833	Have you ever driven a Lotus?
834	836	- No. - You're gonna start right now.
836	840	- You're joking. - No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.
844	848	Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life.
848	851	- I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready? - I am ready.
851	854	- Hang on. - Okay. - Here we go.
859	863	This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together.
863	868	So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, 'cause they have little feet.
868	870	Except me. I wear a size nine.
870	873	You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist?
873	875	Did you know that?
875	879	- No, I didn't know that. - It's a little bit of trivia.
882	887	Tell me, what kind of- what kind of money you girls make these days?
887	889	Ballpark.
889	892	Can't take less than $100.
892	895	- A hundred dollars a night. - For an hour.
895	897	An hour?
897	901	You make $100 an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up?
901	903	You gotta be joking.
903	906	- I never joke about money. - Neither do I.
908	910	Hundred dollars an hour.
910	912	Pretty stiff.
915	919	Well, no. But it's got potential.
937	938	Good evening, Mr. Lewis.
939	941	Will you be needing the car anymore tonight?
941	944	I- I hope not!
946	949	Ah. We're here.
949	951	Yeah.
954	957	So you'll be all right?
957	960	Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.
960	965	- Go back to your office. - Yeah.
965	967	My office. Yeah.
967	970	Well, thanks for the ride.
972	974	- See you. - Good-bye.
988	989	No taxis?
991	993	No, I like the bus.
997	1000	I was thinking- Did you really say $100 an hour?
1000	1002	- Yeah. - Yeah.
1004	1007	Well, if you don't have any prior engagements,
1007	1010	I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.
1010	1012	You got it.
1014	1018	What is your name?
1018	1021	- Edward. - Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world!
1021	1024	- No! - I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.
1024	1028	That's what this is.
1028	1032	- Why don't you put this on? - Why?
1032	1037	Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour.
1037	1039	Ah.
1044	1047	- Wow! - It's all right.
1051	1054	- Holy shit. - You're gonna be fine.
1054	1058	Come with me. And stop fidgeting.
1058	1061	- Good evening, Mr. Lewis. - Hello. You have messages?
1061	1064	- Yes, we have several. - Thank you.
1068	1072	- Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please? - Of course.
1072	1075	Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.
1086	1088	Oh, honey.
1088	1092	You know what's happened? I've got a runner in my pantyhose.
1093	1096	I'm not wearing pantyhose.
1100	1103	Well, color me happy! There's a sofa in here for two.
1105	1109	- First time in an elevator. - Ah.
1109	1112	Close your mouth, dear.
1115	1117	Sorry, I couldn't help it.
1117	1119	Try.
1125	1128	- Penthouse. - The penthouse.
1128	1131	- Yes. - Mmm.
1131	1133	- To the left. - Oh.
1149	1152	Oh, I miss keys.
1167	1169	Impressed?
1169	1172	You kidding me? I come here all the time.
1172	1176	- As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour. - Sure they do.
1178	1180	Wow, great view!
1180	1184	- I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here. - I'll take your word for it.
1184	1187	- I don't go out there. - Why don't you go out there?
1187	1191	- I'm afraid of heights. - You are?
1191	1193	So how come you rented the penthouse?
1193	1197	It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor,
1197	1199	but I can't find one.
1201	1206	Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me?
1206	1209	- Want to know something? I don't have a clue. - No?
1210	1212	I hadn't exactly planned this.
1212	1215	Well, do you plan everything?
1215	1218	- Always. - Yeah. Me too.
1219	1222	I'm actually- No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner.
1222	1226	I would say I was, um, a kind of "fly by the seat of my pants" gal.
1226	1230	You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's- Yeah.
1231	1236	Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me.
1236	1238	That's one way to maybe break the ice.
1238	1243	Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.
1243	1245	Cash works for me, yeah.
1253	1255	You're on my fax.
1256	1259	Well, that's one I haven't been on before.
1262	1264	Cute. She's very cute. Thank you.
1264	1266	All right. Here we go.
1266	1269	Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow.
1269	1272	I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left.
1272	1276	The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is gettin' through this sucker.
1276	1279	- What d'you say? Hmm? - A buffet of safety.
1279	1282	I'm a safety girl.
1284	1288	- All right, let's get one of these on you.
1288	1291	No. I-
1293	1295	Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay?
1295	1300	Talk. Yeah... uh... okay.
1302	1306	Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure?
1306	1309	- Business, I think. - Business, you think.
1309	1312	Well... let me guess.
1312	1314	Well... let me guess.
1314	1318	That would make you... a lawyer.
1318	1321	- A lawyer. - Mm-hmm.
1321	1325	- What makes you think I'm a lawyer? - You've got that, um...
1325	1328	sharp, useless look about you.
1328	1331	I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.
1331	1334	I've known a lot of everybody.
1336	1340	What is that?
1340	1343	- Champagne. - Oh! Well.
1343	1347	Might as well make myself useful.
1347	1350	Take a load off.
1355	1357	- Good evening. - Hi.
1359	1363	- Uh, where would you like it? - Where would we like it?
1363	1365	Uh, over by the bar.
1372	1374	Excuse me!
1374	1376	It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.
1376	1378	Thank you.
1381	1383	What are you lookin' at?
1383	1388	- What is he lookin' at? - Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.
1388	1390	Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.
1390	1394	A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.
1394	1396	- Stupid. - Don't worry about it.
1396	1399	- You mind if I take my boots off? - Not at all.
1399	1404	- So, do you have a wife? Girlfriend? - I have both.
1404	1408	Where are they? Shopping together?
1408	1413	My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...
1414	1416	with my ex-dog.
1418	1424	There you go. My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York...
1424	1428	moving out of my apartment even as we speak.
1435	1437	Why don't you try a strawberry?
1437	1441	- Why? - It brings out the flavor in the champagne.
1441	1443	Oh, groovy.
1451	1453	Pretty good.
1455	1458	- Don't you drink? - No.
1462	1465	Listen, I- I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got goin',
1465	1468	but let me give you a tip: I'm a sure thing, okay?
1468	1471	So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along?
1471	1474	Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.
1474	1476	Why don't we just get through that right now?
1476	1479	- Great, let's get started. - How much for the entire night?
1481	1484	Stay here?
1484	1487	You couldn't afford it.
1487	1491	- Try me. - $300.
1491	1495	Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.
1495	1497	Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night?
1497	1501	I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.
1501	1505	To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight.
1505	1508	- Why? Is it your birthday or something? - No.
1508	1511	I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.
1511	1513	I bet you have.
1516	1518	So what do you want me to do?
1522	1525	I don't know. I really don't know.
1531	1535	I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.
1536	1537	- I didn't hear you. What did you say? - Uh...
1538	1540	I said I'd be out in just a minute.
1540	1543	What is- What do you have in, uh, your hand there?
1543	1546	- What are you hiding? - Nothing.
1548	1552	All right, look. I do not want any drugs here.
1552	1555	I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave.
1555	1557	I don't do drugs, all right? I- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.
1557	1560	What is this? What is this?
1563	1566	- This is dental floss. - Yeah? So?
1566	1571	I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums.
1572	1575	I'm sorry. Please continue.
1575	1577	Thank you.
1583	1587	- Are you gonna watch? - No, I'm going.
1590	1593	Thank you.
1593	1597	It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.
1597	1601	Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of 'em shock the hell outta me.
1605	1608	- You're watching. - I'm going.
1622	1625	Yes, that may be true, Vance.
1625	1629	Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse Industries.
1630	1632	Uh-huh. I've got 'em from London;
1632	1634	I need 'em now from Tokyo.
1634	1638	I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.
1638	1644	I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't want a drink?
1644	1647	I'm high on life. Can't you tell?
1658	1661	You know, I never saw this episode.
1762	1765	What do you want?
1765	1767	What do you do?
1767	1770	Everything.
1770	1772	But I don't kiss on the mouth.
1772	1774	Neither do I.
1835	1838	- Hey, how you doing there? - All right.
1838	1840	- Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
1840	1843	- Good morning, good morning. - Good morning, sir.
1843	1845	- Good morning, Mr. Thompson. - Good morning, Marjorie.
1845	1847	Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected.
1847	1849	He's run his company for a very long time now.
1849	1852	I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.
1852	1854	He wants to meet you face to face.
1854	1857	- I wouldn't do it. - Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow.
1857	1859	Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.
1859	1862	Oh, Edward, Edward. I- Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him.
1862	1865	Definitely not alone. You know? He's a feisty old guy.
1865	1868	You know, we say the wrong thing, we could wind up in court.
1868	1870	Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong.
1870	1876	That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.
1876	1879	- Oh, God. What? - It corners like it's on rails.
1879	1883	What? What does that mean? Edward? Edward!
1885	1887	Hi.
1887	1890	Well, good morning.
1890	1892	Red.
1892	1894	Better.
1896	1899	Y- You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy.
1899	1902	- I'm gonna be outta here in just a minute. - No, there's no hurry.
1902	1904	Are you hungry? You must be.
1904	1907	Why don't you sit and have something to eat?
1909	1913	I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.
1913	1915	I didn't know what you'd like.
1915	1918	- Thanks. - All right? Good.
1923	1925	- Did you sleep well? - Yeah, too good.
1925	1929	- I forgot where I was. - Occupational hazard?
1929	1933	Yeah. Did you sleep?
1933	1937	Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.
1937	1939	I was, uh, working last night.
1939	1942	You don't sleep, you don't do drugs,
1942	1945	you don't drink, you hardly eat.
1945	1948	What do you do, Edward? 'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.
1948	1951	That's right.
1951	1953	There are four other chairs here.
1954	1956	Oh.
1961	1964	- So what do you do? - I buy companies.
1964	1966	What kind of companies?
1967	1971	Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.
1971	1974	If they have problems, you must get 'em for a bargain, huh?
1974	1977	Well, the company I'm buying this week,
1977	1979	I'm getting for the bargain price of about one billion.
1982	1984	- A billion dollars? - Yes.
1984	1987	Wow. You must be really smart, huh?
1990	1992	I only got through the eleventh grade.
1992	1996	How far did you go in school?
1996	1998	I went all the way.
2001	2004	Your folks must be really proud, huh?
2011	2016	So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh?
2016	2019	No, I get some of it from banks, investors.
2019	2022	It's not an easy thing to do.
2022	2026	- And you don't make anything and you don't build anything. - No. No.
2026	2028	- So what do you do with the companies once you buy them? - I sell them.
2029	2031	Here, let me do that. You sell them.
2032	2035	Well, I... don't sell the whole company; I break it up into pieces...
2035	2038	and then I sell that off; it's worth more than the whole.
2038	2043	So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling 'em for the parts, right?
2043	2047	- Yeah, sort of. But legal. - Mm-hmm.
2047	2049	There. See, now it's perfect.
2049	2053	Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that?
2053	2057	Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.
2057	2063	I had a grandpa! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays.
2063	2066	Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go?
2066	2069	Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.
2071	2074	- Hello? - Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.
2074	2076	I just wanted to let you know, Morse is all set for tonight.
2076	2078	- Oh, that's good. - He's bringing his grandson.
2078	2080	He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.
2081	2085	Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.
2085	2089	Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you goin' alone.
2089	2092	# I just want your extra time and your #
2092	2095	Look, I just think it'd be better if you- if you went with a date.
2096	2099	You know? Keep it social.
2099	2102	- Edward? Did you hear me? - Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.
2102	2105	- # If you want to impress me # - What is that?
2105	2107	- # Oh # - Housekeeping is singing.
2107	2109	# Got to be too flirty, Mama #
2110	2113	- # I know how to undress me # - Yeah... listen.
2113	2117	- Edward, I know a lot of nice girls. - No, you don't.
2117	2121	# I just want your extra time and your #
2121	2123	# Kiss #
2123	2128	- Besides, I already have one. - # If you want to impress me #
2128	2133	You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to. I'm on my way.
2133	2138	# I know how to undress me Mm-hmm, yeah, baby #
2138	2142	# I want to be your fantasy #
2142	2145	# Well, maybe you could be mine #
2145	2148	# Mm-hmm You just leave it #
2148	2151	# All up to me ##
2151	2155	Don't you just love Prince?
2155	2158	- More than life itself. - Don't you knock?
2158	2161	Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.
2161	2164	- What do you want? - I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.
2164	2166	I'd like you to spend the week with me.
2168	2171	- Really? - Yes.
2171	2173	Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee.
2174	2178	- Would you consider spending the week with me?
2178	2182	I will pay you to be at my beck and call.
2182	2185	Look, I'd love to be your "beck and call girl,"
2185	2188	but you're a rich, good-lookin' guy.
2188	2190	You could get a million girls free.
2190	2192	I want a professional.
2192	2196	I don't need any romantic hassles this week.
2197	2200	If you're talkin' 24 hours a day, it's gonna cost you.
2200	2203	Oh, yes, of course!
2204	2206	All right, here we go.
2206	2208	Give me a ballpark figure. How much?
2208	2213	Six full nights, days too.
2213	2217	- Four thousand. - Six nights at 300 is 1,800.
2217	2220	- You want days too. - Two thousand.
2220	2222	- Three thousand. - Done.
2222	2227	Holy shit!
2228	2230	Vivian.
2230	2233	Vivian, is that a yes?
2236	2240	Yes. Yes!
2240	2243	I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some clothes.
2243	2246	- You really should think about traveler's checks. - We may be going out evenings.
2246	2249	- You'll need something to wear. - Like what?
2249	2252	Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.
2253	2256	- Conservative. You understand? - Boring.
2256	2259	Elegant. Any questions?
2259	2262	- Can I call you Eddie? - Not if you expect me to answer.
2262	2265	I would've stayed for 2,000.
2265	2268	I would've paid four.
2268	2270	- I'll see you tonight. - Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,
2270	2273	you're never gonna wanna let me go.
2275	2279	Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you go.
2284	2286	But I'm here now.
2297	2301	Three thousand dollars!
2306	2308	Ooh.
2312	2314	Hello?
2314	2317	I called and called. Where were you last night?
2317	2319	- Ma? - It's Viv.
2319	2321	Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you?
2321	2324	Oh, man. Are you ready for this? The guy?
2324	2327	The Lotus? I am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills.
2328	2331	The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana!
2331	2333	Do I have to hear this?
2333	2336	Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what he's gonna give me?
2336	2338	Guess. You'll never guess.
2339	2341	- Three thousand dollars. - Bullshit!
2341	2344	I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.
2344	2348	Oh, man! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you!
2348	2350	Three thousand. Really? Is he twisted?
2350	2353	- No. - Ugly? - He's good-looking!
2353	2355	- Well, what's wrong with him? - Nothing.
2355	2359	- Did he give you the money yet? - At the end of the week. - That's what's wrong with him.
2359	2362	Well, he gave me 300 for last night. And, Kit?
2362	2365	I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you to pick it up.
2365	2369	I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Write it down.
2369	2372	Are you writing it down? You'll forget it. Write it down.
2372	2376	Reg... Bev... Wil.
2376	2379	Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.
2380	2381	- In Beverly Hills? - Yeah.
2382	2384	Rodeo Drive, baby.
2388	2390	- Hi. - Yes, ma'am. May I help you?
2391	2393	Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.
2394	2396	- Don't open that. - No, ma'am.
2400	2402	- Grazie. - Arrivederci.
2406	2408	Miss Wilson, do you know that lady?
2408	2410	No, sir.
2410	2412	# Wild women do #
2412	2416	# And they don't regret it #
2418	2423	# Wild women show what they're goin' through #
2423	2426	# Ooh #
2426	2432	# Wild women do what you think you'll never #
2433	2439	# What you only dream about wild women do #
2440	2443	# Oh, yes, they do #

2471	2477	# What they're goin' through Ooh, yeah #
2477	2480	# Wild women do what you think you'll never ##
2480	2484	- May I help you? - I'm just checkin' things out.
2484	2486	Are you looking for something in particular?
2486	2491	No. Well, yeah. Something... conservative.
2491	2493	Yes.
2496	2498	- You got nice stuff. - Thank you.
2498	2501	- How much is this? - I don't think this would fit you.
2501	2505	Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
2506	2508	How much is this, Marie?
2508	2510	It's very expensive.
2510	2514	- It's very expensive. - Look, I got money to spend in here.
2514	2517	I don't think we have anything for you.
2517	2519	You're obviously in the wrong place.
2519	2521	Please leave.
2537	2541	Doctor's office? Two blocks down and to your left.
2541	2543	Thank you.
2550	2553	Tiffany is taking the corner space; they like the project.
2553	2555	We're very excited about the whole thing.
2555	2558	Did you realize that Via Rodeo is the first new street...
2558	2560	in Beverly Hills in 75 years?
2562	2565	- Excuse me, miss, may I help you? - I'm going to my room.
2565	2569	- Uh, do you have a key? - Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing.
2569	2571	- I'm on the top floor. - You're a guest here?
2571	2574	- I'm with a friend. - And who would that be?
2574	2577	- Edward. - Edward?
2577	2579	Edward... Edward, uh-
2580	2584	- He knows me. - Dennis.
2585	2587	Dennis, did you just come off the night shift? Hmm?
2588	2590	- Yes, sir. - Do you know this young lady?
2590	2593	- She's with Mr. Lewis. - Mr. Lewis.
2593	2596	That's it. Edward Lewis! Thanks, Dennis.
2596	2598	- Evidently she joined him last night. - Thank you.
2600	2603	Oh, God! What now? What? What?
2603	2605	- What is with everybody today? - No, no. It's all right. Just come with me.
2605	2608	- We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you. - I'm coming.
2608	2611	- Uh, what is your name, miss? - What do you want it to be?
2611	2614	- Don't play with me, young lady. - Vivian.
2614	2616	Thank you. Vivian.
2616	2620	Well, Miss Vivian.
2620	2624	Things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
2624	2627	Now, Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer,
2627	2630	and we like to think of our special customers as friends.
2630	2635	Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,
2635	2637	but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it.
2637	2640	Now, I'm assuming that you're a-
2642	2644	- Relative? - Yes.
2644	2649	I thought so. Then you must be his-
2649	2652	Niece?
2652	2657	Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
2659	2661	I assume you have no other uncles here.
2663	2666	Good! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you...
2666	2669	to dress a little more appropriately; that'll be all.
2669	2672	No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go...
2672	2675	get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me.
2675	2677	And I have all this money now and no dress!
2677	2680	Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay?
2680	2682	I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight.
2682	2685	And nobody will help me.
2697	2699	Oh, man, if you're callin' the cops.
2699	2703	Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.
2703	2705	Women's clothing.
2705	2707	Bridget, please.
2716	2722	Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil-
2722	2727	Thank you, yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for me, please.
2727	2729	I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian.
2729	2731	She's a special guest.
2731	2735	She's the niece of a very special guest.
2736	2739	Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown:
2739	2742	prime industrial property straddling the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.
2742	2746	The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the yard we'll just level.
2746	2749	We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey.
2749	2753	Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please?
2753	2755	Yeah, what? Speak.
2755	2761	Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a $350 million contract...
2761	2763	to build destroyers for the Navy.
2763	2765	Navy contract. I can't believe this.
2765	2769	- You said they had nothing in the hopper on this one! - I thought they didn't.
2769	2771	Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more.
2771	2773	Those stocks could go through the roof.
2773	2777	- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. - Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir.
2777	2780	- See, we can still walk away from it. - Walk away?
2780	2782	Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man-hours in on this!
2782	2784	- Nobody's walkin' away from anything! - Philip, I think he's right.
2784	2787	Gentlemen, relax!
2787	2791	Relax! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee?
2791	2793	Senator Adams.
2793	2795	All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.
2795	2800	The Navy's not gonna spend $350 million on anything without going to Appropriations first.
2800	2802	- I don't understand what's goin' on here today, gentlemen. - Hello?
2802	2805	That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.
2805	2807	I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals?
2807	2810	- No problem. - Thank you. - Edward.
2810	2814	- Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight? - Mm-hmm.
2814	2817	Who- Who is this girl you're going with?
2817	2819	Nobody you know.
2819	2822	Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey.
2822	2824	Yes, I have him right here.
2824	2828	- Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in. - Thank you.
2828	2830	- Have a nice day. - Thank you.
2835	2838	Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.
2838	2841	- Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.
2841	2845	He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town?
2845	2848	- We're gonna have dinner. - Oh, don't sit on there, dear!
2848	2850	- You're gonna go out? Dinner? - Mm-hmm.
2850	2853	Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.
2853	2857	Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your uncle will love.
2857	2860	- You're a size six, right? - Yeah. How'd you know that?
2860	2864	- Oh, that's my job. - Bridg, he's not really my uncle.
2864	2866	They never are, dear.
2869	2871	Barney! Sorry, mister.
2871	2874	I got a dress!
2874	2876	Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
2876	2878	Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?
2878	2881	No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.
2881	2883	Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but Bridget was really great...
2883	2885	and I just wanted to say thanks.
2885	2888	- You're cool. - You're welcome, Miss Vivian.
2894	2896	Hello?
2896	2898	Never, ever pick up the phone.
2898	2901	- Then why are you calling me? - Did you buy clothes today?
2901	2904	- I got a dress. A cocktail one. - That's good.
2904	2906	I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp.
2906	2908	What? You're not comin' up to the door?
2908	2910	This isn't a date. It's business.
2910	2912	Where are you takin' me, anyway?
2912	2914	I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.
2914	2917	- Very elegant. - All right.
2917	2920	I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause you're payin' me to.
2920	2922	Well, thank you very much.
2925	2927	Get her back for me, please.
2927	2933	- Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you. - Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.
2933	2936	Hello?
2936	2939	- I told you not to pick up the phone. - Then stop callin' me.
2940	2944	Sick.
2946	2949	- Barney! - It didn't fit.
2949	2953	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh- I've got a little problem.
2953	2955	All right, Miss Vivian, one more time.
2955	2960	- Dinner napkin. - Dinner napkin, laid gently in the lap.
2960	2964	Good. Elbows off the table. Don't slouch.
2964	2966	Shrimp fork,
2967	2969	salad fork, dinner fork.
2969	2971	I definitely have the salad fork.
2971	2974	The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.
2974	2977	All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines.
2977	2979	Four tines: dinner fork.
2979	2984	And sometimes there are three tines in the salad fork. And sometimes-
2998	3001	Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel.
3001	3003	- Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call. - Yes, um, sir.
3003	3006	- I have a message for you, sir. - From who?
3006	3009	- From your niece, sir. - My what?
3009	3012	The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.
3012	3015	Oh. Hmm.
3015	3018	- I think we both know that she's not my niece. - Of course.
3019	3021	The reason I know that is that I am an only child.
3021	3024	- Yes, sir. - What's the message?
3024	3026	She's waiting for you in the lounge.
3026	3031	Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian.
3031	3035	- Intriguing. - Have a good evening, sir.
3035	3040	- Thank you, Mr. -? - Thompson. I'm the manager- manager of the hotel, sir.
3077	3079	You're late.
3079	3081	You're stunning.
3081	3083	You're forgiven.
3085	3087	Shall we go to dinner?
3100	3103	- This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting. - Stop fidgeting.
3107	3111	- Mr. Morse. - Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.
3111	3115	This fireball is my grandson, David.
3115	3118	Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is true enough.
3118	3121	I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.
3121	3125	- Hi. I'm really glad to meet you. - Mr. Morse. David.
3125	3127	Please, sit.
3132	3134	Excuse me.
3136	3139	- Where are you going? - I'm going to the ladies' room.
3141	3144	- Upstairs, to the right. - Okay. Excuse me.
3146	3150	- Shall I order for you? - Yeah.
3150	3152	Please do so. Thank you.
3152	3154	I'll do that.
3161	3163	Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a company...
3164	3166	- should control its destiny. - Where's the salad?
3168	3171	Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.
3171	3174	That's the fork I knew.
3174	3177	Let me, uh, put it another way.
3177	3181	Between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing,
3181	3183	we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are.
3183	3187	I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what!
3204	3206	You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of cities.
3206	3210	- Men like my grandfather made this country. - Who ordered this?
3210	3212	The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetite.
3212	3216	These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy.
3216	3219	Try it. David?
3219	3223	Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control- and I don't think you will- but if you did,
3223	3226	what do you plan to do with the company?
3226	3228	Break it up and sell off the pieces.
3228	3231	I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...
3231	3236	of your turning 40 years of my work into your garage sale.
3236	3239	At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.
3239	3244	I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.
3246	3249	Slippery little suckers.
3251	3254	It happens all the time.
3255	3258	I met your father. What's his name?
3258	3263	- Carter. - Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.
3263	3266	He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.
3266	3269	- No, I have the franchise on that. - Does that make him proud?
3269	3274	I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.
3274	3277	Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.
3277	3279	I'm sorry too.
3279	3282	Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you?
3283	3287	- Leave my company alone. - I can't do that. I own ten million shares.
3288	3290	- I'll buy your stock back. - You don't have the money.
3291	3293	We will; we're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.
3293	3297	There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee.
3297	3300	- And it will remain there. - And how the hell did you pull something like that?
3300	3302	You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something?
3302	3305	Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.
3305	3309	- Mr. Lewis plays hardball. - Yes, yes, I do.
3309	3313	I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you.
3313	3317	I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.
3317	3320	I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.
3320	3324	I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.
3325	3329	Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.
3329	3332	I look forward to it, sir.
3334	3337	Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they?
3337	3339	He seems like a nice man.
3342	3346	I guess $3,000 does not buy loyalty, does it?
3346	3349	I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson.
3349	3352	Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does.
3352	3354	- No, just the two. - Yes, sir.
3374	3377	- It's ketchup. - Yes, sir.
3377	3379	- Check, please. - Yes, sir.
3380	3382	Haven't they ever seen ketchup before?
3383	3384	Not in this building.
3388	3390	Edward?
3392	3394	Edward, you said you never come out here.
3394	3398	Well, I'm only halfway out.
3398	3402	Didn't say much in the car on the way home.
3402	3406	You thinkin' about dinner? I was a maniac.
3406	3409	I mean, the business was good, I think. You know?
3409	3413	He's in trouble. You want his company.
3413	3415	He doesn't want to let it go.
3415	3417	Thanks for the recap.
3417	3421	The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.
3421	3424	I'd like for you to get down from there; you're making me very nervous.
3424	3428	It's making you nervous? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this?
3428	3430	Would you- Would you rescue me if I fell?
3430	3432	Vivian, I'm serious. Come- I'm not looking.
3432	3436	It's really high. Look, no hands, no hands! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.
3438	3444	The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not.
3444	3447	I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.
3447	3452	I know. Kit's always saying to me,
3452	3454	"Don't get emotional when you turn tricks. "
3454	3457	That's why no kissing. It's too personal.
3457	3460	It's like what you're saying: You stay numb, you don't get involved.
3460	3463	When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it.
3469	3472	I mean... except with you.
3472	3474	Oh, of course, not with me.
3476	3480	You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian.
3480	3482	We both screw people for money.
3488	3490	I was sorry to hear about your dad.
3490	3494	- When did he die? - Last month.
3496	3498	Do you miss him?
3498	3503	I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years.
3505	3508	I wasn't there when he died.
3508	3511	- Do you want to talk about this? - No.
3511	3515	Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.
3515	3521	Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in front of the TV.
3521	3525	- "Veg out"? - Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.
3528	3533	Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow.
3534	3538	- Where are you going? - I'm going downstairs for a while.
3540	3543	Did you say marriage license?
3543	3545	Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp.
3545	3550	Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your name is.
3550	3552	Oh, I love you.
3564	3568	Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here,
3569	3572	Mr. Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere?
3612	3614	Thank you. Thank you very much.
3614	3617	I didn't know you played.
3617	3619	I only play for strangers.
3619	3623	I was gettin' lonely upstairs all by myself.
3628	3632	Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please?
3635	3637	Thank you.
3639	3642	People always do what you tell them to do?
3673	3676	I guess so.
3735	3736	Wake up. Time to shop.
3739	3743	Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them call the hotel.
3743	3746	All right?
3746	3748	More shopping.
3748	3750	Mm-hmm.
3750	3754	I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.
3754	3758	- Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be. - Why not?
3758	3761	They were mean to me.
3761	3763	Mean to you?
3766	3768	People are looking at me.
3768	3770	They're not looking at you; they're looking at me.
3770	3773	The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.
3773	3778	Stores are never nice to people; they're nice to credit cards.
3778	3782	Okay, stop fidgeting. Get rid of your gum.
3784	3786	I don't believe you did that.
3788	3792	- Yes. - I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?
3792	3795	- Edward Lewis. - Ah, yes, sir.
3795	3798	- You see this young lady over here. - Yes.
3798	3803	- Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is? - Oh, yes.
3803	3808	Oh, no! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be.
3808	3811	That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.
3811	3816	- That's why when you came in- - Excuse me. We're gonna need a few more people helping us.
3816	3820	I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here.
3820	3823	So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us.
3823	3826	That's what we really like. You understand that.
3826	3829	Sir, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter.
3829	3832	Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun.
3832	3835	Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it!
3835	3837	- Come on. Bring it out, girls. - Oh, this is absolutely divine.
3837	3839	- Excuse me, sir, uh, - Yeah?
3839	3843	exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about?
3843	3845	Just profane or really offensive?
3845	3850	- Really offensive. - I like him so much!
3865	3868	Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far? Pretty well, I think.
3868	3872	I think we need some major sucking up.
3872	3876	Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man.
3876	3879	I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with-
3879	3881	- Hollister. - Yes, sir.
3881	3883	Not me. Her.
3883	3885	I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
3885	3887	How we doing, ladies?
3887	3889	Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you?
3889	3892	The word's all over the street. Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.
3892	3895	He's countering? God, he is a tough old bird.
3895	3898	He knows the navy contracts are stalled. Where's he gonna get the money?
3898	3900	I don't know. He, uh- I think he's throwin' in with the employees.
3900	3903	He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.
3903	3906	- Find out who it is. - Yeah, okay. You got it.
3906	3910	You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look great!
3910	3913	- She has my card. - And we'll help her use it, sir.
3916	3919	# Pretty woman walking down the street #
3920	3923	# Pretty woman the kind I like to meet #
3924	3926	# Pretty woman #
3926	3930	# I don't believe you You're not the truth #
3930	3936	# No one could look as good as you Mercy #
3940	3943	- Edward would love that tie. - Would you give her the tie?
3943	3945	- The tie? - Take off the tie. Give her the tie.
3945	3947	- He wants to do this, by the way. - He would go crazy about this tie.
3947	3949	Who ordered pizza?
3949	3953	# Pretty woman, stop a while #
3953	3956	# Pretty woman, talk a while #

3976	3978	- Hello. - Do you remember me?
3978	3981	- No, I'm sorry. - I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.
3981	3984	- Oh. - You work on commission, right?
3984	3986	Uh, yes.
3986	3989	Big mistake. Big. Huge!
3989	3992	I have to go shopping now.

4018	4020	- Mister Lewis. - Gentlemen.
4020	4022	Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh?
4022	4026	Jake, set something up with Blair. Around 2:00, 2:30 would be good.
4026	4030	You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear,
4031	4033	to secure a loan from the bank.
4033	4035	And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh?
4036	4038	- Hmm. - So, it goes without saying...
4038	4040	that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse.
4040	4043	All you gotta do is call the bank.
4046	4048	Yeah.
4052	4057	Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week?
4057	4061	Are you givin' Morse a chance to get away?
4061	4065	You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil?
4065	4068	What?
4068	4070	Blocks.
4072	4074	Building blocks. Erector sets.
4074	4078	So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point?
4078	4083	We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.
4083	4085	We make money, Edward.
4085	4088	We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted.
4089	4091	I'm handing it to you.
4091	4095	Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill.
4095	4097	Let's finish this.
4097	4099	Call the bank!
4120	4122	How was your day, dear?
4126	4128	Nice tie.
4128	4130	I got it for you.
4132	4135	Well, my mother was a music teacher...
4135	4140	and married my father, whose family was extremely wealthy.
4140	4144	Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman.
4144	4146	And he took his money with him.
4147	4150	And then she died.
4150	4152	I was very angry with him.
4152	4155	It cost me $10,000 in therapy to say that sentence.
4155	4157	I was very angry with him.
4157	4159	I do it very well, don't I? I'll say it again. I was very angry with him.
4159	4163	Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.
4163	4167	I would've been angry at the $10,000.
4167	4173	My father was president of the third company I ever took over.
4174	4178	I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.
4178	4182	- What'd the shrink say? - He said I was cured.
4182	4186	Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.
4191	4195	Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe,
4195	4201	so, basically, we're talkin' about 88 inches of therapy...
4201	4204	wrapped around you for the bargain price of...
4205	4207	$3,000.
4207	4210	Yeah.
4212	4215	Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.
4215	4217	This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen giving you play-by-play...
4217	4220	- of this marvelous charity event. - Watch where you're walking.
4220	4223	If you step in something, we're not going back in the car.
4223	4228	Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants. Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere?
4228	4232	- What if someone recognizes me? - Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Blvd.
4232	4236	- You did. - Come on. Let go. Let go.
4236	4238	All right. You look great. You look like a lady.
4238	4240	You're gonna have a wonderful time.
4242	4246	Okay. Don't fidget and smile.
4246	4248	Humboldt's coming around to this side.
4248	4251	Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.
4251	4254	This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters,
4254	4257	who have made marrying well an art form.
4257	4259	- Edward. - Be back in just a second. Hold on.
4259	4262	So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.
4262	4266	Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible bachelor.
4266	4268	Everybody is trying to land him.
4268	4273	Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex.
4273	4276	Oh, yes.
4276	4280	- Well done. - Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo!
4281	4284	Tell me again why we're here.
4284	4287	- Business. - Business mingling?
4287	4289	Yeah.
4289	4291	That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.
4291	4293	Falcons, seven. Gems, four.
4293	4297	- Excuse me. Edward! Edward. Over here. - Phil.
4298	4299	- Ah, good to see you. - You too.
4300	4301	I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.
4302	4304	Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth.
4305	4308	It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.
4308	4310	Oh, my God! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.
4310	4313	Tate! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.
4315	4319	Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns.
4319	4322	Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay?
4322	4324	I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here?
4324	4326	Mm-hmm. I asked him.
4327	4331	That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm!
4331	4335	Real genuine guy. Who is he?
4335	4337	He's my lawyer. He's all right.
4337	4339	You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.
4339	4341	Maybe we'll try that later.
4341	4344	- Are these people your friends? - I spend time with them, yeah.
4345	4348	- Well, no wonder. - No wonder what?
4348	4351	No wonder why you came looking for me.
4351	4355	And I do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in the audience.
4355	4358	We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on the grass.
4359	4361	- So come on out now. Come on! Come on, folks.
4361	4364	You heard her. The stomping of the divots.
4364	4367	This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen.
4367	4372	As old as the game of polo itself. Kings and queens used to do this.
4373	4375	She's sweet, Edward.
4376	4378	Wherever did you find her?
4378	4381	976-BABE.
4383	4388	Only one word of advice: Avoid the steaming divot!
4394	4397	No, it's all part of the game of polo.
4397	4400	You get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club.
4400	4402	I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.
4402	4404	Thank you.
4404	4409	- Vivian, hi. David Morse. - Excuse me.
4409	4411	- David. - How are ya?
4411	4413	- I'm okay. - I thought that was you. I like this hat.
4413	4417	- It's new. - What are you looking at?
4417	4421	- Edward's date. - I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car.
4422	4424	- Okay, hon? - Uh-huh.
4424	4429	I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked belly dance for the polo players.
4429	4431	Have fun.
4431	4435	- Come meet my horse, Vivian. - Well, Edward's waiting for me.
4435	4438	- He's right here. - Okay, I'll- Just for a second, though.
4438	4439	I didn't know you were playing today.
4440	4443	Uh, I was asking for directions. There she was.
4443	4446	Oh, so you just ran into her? That's great. Jesus.
4446	4450	So anyway, what does she do? Does she work?
4450	4453	- She's in sales. - Sales? That's terrific. That's good.
4453	4455	What does she sell?
4457	4459	Why do you want to know?
4460	4463	Just hear me out on this. I've known you a long time.
4463	4468	I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh-
4468	4471	I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference,
4471	4474	especially when I see her talking to David Morse.
4478	4480	- I introduced them at dinner the other night. - So what?
4480	4483	Now they're best friends? This girl appears out of nowhere.
4483	4487	Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. Convenient, don't you think?
4487	4490	- Don't be ridiculous. - How do you know that this girl...
4490	4493	hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse?
4493	4495	- This happens! Industrial espionage- - Phil, Phil, Phil!
4495	4497	- Phil, listen to me. - What?
4497	4501	- She's not a spy. She is a hooker. - Oh!
4501	4503	She is a hooker.
4505	4508	I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard.
4508	4510	In your car.
4514	4516	- Oh, you are- - Yes, yes.
4516	4518	Oh, man!
4518	4521	You're the only millionaire I ever heard of...
4522	4525	who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know?
4525	4528	- Edward! - I'm sorry I told you.
4528	4532	Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.
4532	4534	Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.
4534	4537	Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it. There's no change, is there?
4537	4539	No, it's still bogged down.
4542	4545	- Having a nice time, Vivian? - Yeah, I'm having a great time.
4545	4548	Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?
4550	4552	What?
4552	4554	Yeah, Edward told me.
4554	4558	But don't worry; you're secret is safe with me.
4558	4562	Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime...
4562	4564	after Edward leaves.
4566	4568	Yeah, sure. Why not?
4569	4572	We'll just have to do that, hmm?
4572	4574	Philip.
4576	4578	Hi, tailgaters.
4578	4580	I'd like to mention a couple of our silver sponsors:
4580	4583	Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery,
4583	4587	and we'd like to give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor,
4587	4591	Edward Lewis Enterprises.
4591	4593	The ball is in for chukker number four.
4602	4605	- You all right? - I'm fine.
4605	4609	Fine. That's good. Seven "fines" since we left the match.
4609	4611	Could I have another word, please?
4611	4613	Asshole! There's a word.
4615	4617	I think I liked "fine" better.
4617	4621	You know what? Just tell me one thing: Why did you make me get all dressed up?
4621	4623	Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.
4623	4627	No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,
4627	4630	- why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay? - I did not- I did not-
4630	4633	I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,
4633	4636	I can handle it; I'm prepared.
4636	4641	I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.
4641	4644	But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years.
4644	4648	He thought you were some kind of industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.
4648	4651	Are you my pimp now? You think you can pass me around to your friends?
4651	4655	- I'm not some little toy! - Look, I know you're not my toy. Vivian!
4655	4658	Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here!
4658	4660	I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker!
4660	4663	- And you are my employee! - Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay?
4663	4666	I say who; I say when; I- I say who-
4666	4670	I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it.
4670	4673	That's the end of it!
4673	4675	I'm sorry I ever met you.
4676	4678	I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car!
4678	4682	As if you had so many more appealing options.
4683	4688	I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.
4688	4691	Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.
4699	4701	Where are you going?
4701	4704	I want my money. I want to get out of here.
4750	4752	Come on!
4764	4766	I'm sorry.
4768	4772	I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.
4774	4777	It was stupid and cruel.
4778	4779	I didn't mean it.
4780	4783	I don't want you to go.
4783	4787	- Will you stay the week? - Why?
4789	4794	I saw you talking to David Morse; I didn't like it.
4794	4796	We were just talking.
4800	4802	I didn't like it.
4805	4807	Down?
4819	4821	You hurt me.
4822	4824	Yes.
4826	4828	Don't do it again.
4850	4854	First guy I ever loved was a total nothing.
4855	4856	Second was worse.
4857	4858	My mom called me a bum magnet.
4859	4863	If there was a bum within a 50-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him.
4863	4867	That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three.
4867	4869	Oh.
4869	4872	So here I was: no money, no friends, no bum.
4875	4878	And you chose this as your profession?
4880	4883	I worked at a couple fast food places,
4883	4886	parked cars at wrestling.
4886	4890	And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home.
4890	4892	That's when I met Kit.
4892	4895	She was a hooker and made it sound so great.
4896	4898	So one day I did it.
4900	4902	I cried the whole time.
4905	4908	But then I got some regulars and, you know-
4908	4912	It's not like anybody plans this; it's not your childhood dream.
4916	4919	You could be so much more.
4921	4925	People put you down enough, you start to believe it.
4927	4933	I think you are a very bright, very special woman.
4934	4938	The bad stuff is easier to believe.
4938	4940	You ever notice that?
4949	4952	- Tell him I'll call him on Monday. - Yes, sir.
4952	4955	- Where you going? Did he sign these? - No, he said he had to leave.
4955	4958	- Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep. - Don't panic, Philip.
4958	4961	Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning.
4961	4963	- Did you send the tickets to the hotel? Thank you. - Yes, sir.
4963	4965	- Where are you going? - I have a date.
4965	4967	With the hooker?
4971	4973	Be careful, Philip.
4994	4996	- Do I look okay? - Mmm.
4996	4999	- Mmm? - Something's missing.
4999	5003	Well, nothin' else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell ya that.
5003	5005	Well, maybe something in this box.
5005	5009	I don't want you to get too excited. This is only on loan.
5015	5017	Oh!
5017	5021	They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store?
5021	5023	I'm a very good customer.
5023	5026	If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost?
5026	5028	Quarter of a million.
5028	5030	A quarter of a million dollars?
5036	5038	So, where we goin'?
5038	5040	It's a surprise.
5043	5047	If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time tonight.
5047	5049	Thank you.
5069	5071	When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful...
5072	5073	and very tall.
5074	5078	# You're a dream coming true #
5078	5081	# I can't believe how I have #
5081	5083	# Fallen for you #
5086	5089	# You are the one #
5089	5094	# Who's led me to the sun #
5094	5097	- # How could I know # - You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine?
5098	5101	- # I was lost without you # - I've never been on a plane before.
5102	5105	# And I want to tell you #
5105	5109	# You control my brain #
5110	5113	# And you should know that #
5113	5116	# You are life in my veins ##
5117	5119	Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis.
5119	5121	The weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco.
5121	5124	We should be there in about 50 minutes.
5135	5138	- We're late. - No, it's all right.
5138	5143	- Opening night never starts on time. - Okay.
5143	5145	- Program, sir. - Thank you.
5148	5150	How nice to meet you.
5154	5156	Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.
5161	5163	- Doris, how nice to see you. - How are you?
5164	5166	- Sir. Wonderful news. Congratulations. - Good evening, Edward.
5166	5168	- Hey, come here. You gotta look at this. - It's all right.
5168	5173	- I've already seen it. - If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here?
5173	5175	Because they're the best.
5176	5178	- Is there anything else, sir? - No, thank you.
5178	5182	- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera. - Oh!
5182	5185	- So, you said this is in Italian. - Uh-huh.
5185	5188	So how am I gonna know what they're singin'? These are broken.
5188	5192	- Mine are broken. - No, no. That's okay It's all right.
5192	5195	- Oh. - You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.
5195	5197	The music's very powerful.
5200	5202	There's a band!
5204	5208	People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic.
5208	5211	They either love it or they hate it.
5211	5214	If they love it, they will always love it.
5214	5217	If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it,
5217	5221	but it will never become part of their soul.
5222	5224	- Mmm. - ##
5337	5342	- Did you enjoy the opera, dear? - Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.
5342	5344	What?
5344	5348	She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.
5348	5350	- Oh! - Yes.
5350	5352	Good-bye now.
5358	5360	- No, don't touch- - I moved the queen. I like the queen.
5360	5362	You can't move the queen.
5362	5364	Did you really do that?
5366	5371	Why don't we finish this tomorrow? It's really late, and I have to work.
5371	5375	Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.
5375	5378	- Me, not work? - Yeah.
5382	5383	I do own the company.
5396	5399	Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis called.
5399	5403	- What'd he say? - He said he's taking the day off.
5403	5406	- He's taking the day off? - That's what he said.
5409	5414	I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you have any money?
5414	5416	I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have money.
5416	5420	Well, I'm gonna give, um - you'll buy a snap dog; we'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.
5420	5422	- Cop a what? - Cop a squat.
5422	5425	All right, read the first two pages.
5425	5427	Okay.
5428	5430	Mmm.
5432	5434	I was talking to someone.
5459	5463	Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard tonight...
5463	5466	were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's shop?
5466	5469	They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.
5471	5473	What's with you? You're fidgeting. What's wrong?
5473	5477	Um, there's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for a second to see my roommate,
5477	5480	- if that's okay? - Absolutelty.
5480	5482	- Yeah? - Darryl.
5482	5486	Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway, please?
5486	5488	- The Blue Banana? - The Blue Banana.
5488	5491	Very colorful life you lead.
5496	5500	You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice place.
5500	5504	I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so just stay here.
5504	5507	- I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is. - I'll block it with my body.

5525	5530	Hey, Viv, you lookin' good, man. What'd you win, the lottery or what?
5530	5534	- Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit? - No, not since, uh, Tuesday.
5534	5536	Hey, and Carlos is looking for her too.
5538	5540	- Hiya, honey, you look great. - Hi, Pops. Thanks.
5540	5543	- Have you seen Kit? - I think she went to Santa Barbara.
5549	5551	Hi.
5551	5555	Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the week. Have her call me, okay?
5555	5557	- Okay, honey. Thanks. - Thanks.
5563	5566	What's going on out here?
5566	5570	I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story.
5570	5572	I think you owe me some money, baby.
5572	5574	- Two hundred dollars. - Don't you go to school tomorrow?
5576	5578	Now I hear you got yourself a new job?
5578	5581	- Let's just leave. - You ain't goin' no place.
5581	5585	- Hey, hey, hey- - You're outta your neighborhood. This ain't no Beverly Hills!
5585	5587	I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his skateboard.
5588	5591	He's going to stab me. What, you gonna strangle me with a Slinky?
5591	5593	Shut up!
5593	5599	All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe this person owes you $200?
5599	5601	- That's right. - Why?
5601	5604	Because this is my block.
5604	5607	- His block? - He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit.
5607	5610	- Let's just go, Edward. - Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick?
5610	5612	I am not a trick.
5612	5615	This is a trick. Darryl!
5615	5617	Left pocket.
5619	5623	Isn't that incredible? And he does have a permit. Thank you, gentlemen.
5623	5626	Don't you ever go near her again.
5626	5628	Does Darryl always carry a gun?
5628	5631	When he drives me, yes, always.
5644	5646	He sleeps.
5797	5799	I love you.
5810	5813	What are you thinkin' about sittin' here all by yourself?
5813	5818	The fact that this will be our last night together, and you'll finally be rid of me.
5818	5821	Well, you've been pretty tough to take.
5821	5825	My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New York.
5829	5832	I'd really like to see you again.
5832	5834	- You would? - Yes.
5834	5839	Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an apartment, to have a car,
5839	5843	a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up to you anytime you want to go shopping.
5843	5848	- Everything's done. - What else?
5848	5851	You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town?
5852	5854	Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.
5854	5857	How would it be?
5857	5862	- Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets. - That's just geography.
5872	5876	Vivian, what is it you want?
5878	5881	What do you see happening between us?
5881	5883	I don't know.
5887	5890	When I was a little girl,
5890	5895	my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often.
5895	5899	And I would- I would pretend I was a princess...
5899	5902	trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.
5902	5906	And then suddenly this knight...
5906	5912	on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword.
5912	5914	And I would wave.
5914	5919	And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.
5922	5924	But never in all the time...
5924	5929	that I had this dream did the knight say to me,
5929	5933	"Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a great condo. "
5941	5943	- Yes. - I had to call.
5943	5946	I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.
5946	5948	- He wants to meet with you today. - What about?
5948	5952	He wouldn't say. Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block.
5952	5954	We got him!
5954	5958	Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon.
5958	5961	No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to wait 'til this afternoon.
5961	5964	Have Morse meet me downtown this morning. Good-bye.
5972	5975	I have to go now,
5975	5979	but I want you to understand...
5979	5981	I heard everything you said.
5982	5985	This is all I'm capable of right now.
5985	5987	It's a very big step for me.
5989	5994	I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.
5996	5998	I've never treated you like a prostitute.
6005	6007	You just did.
6009	6012	It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.
6012	6016	Could you come down to the front desk? There's someone here who wants to speak to you.
6016	6019	- She says her name is Miss De Luca- - Let me talk to her.
6019	6022	Let me- Let me just talk to her.
6022	6027	Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here? The sphincter police won't let me through.
6027	6030	- Okay. She's on her way. - Fine.
6030	6032	- Mr. Thompson. - Yes.
6032	6035	The window washer is refusing to come down.
6035	6037	It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.
6037	6039	- Watch her. - Yes, sir.
6051	6056	Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For 75, the wife can watch.
6060	6062	Listen, I've been calling you.
6062	6064	Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were lookin' for me.
6064	6066	You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at the desk.
6066	6068	- I was hidin' from Carlos. - Well, if you picked up the money,
6068	6072	- you wouldn't have to hide. - I was busy. I had a life. Nino got beat up.
6072	6076	We had to visit him in the hospital, Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.
6076	6080	Anyway, I got the money. Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.
6080	6083	You know, he was talkin' about you last night.
6083	6085	He would bust somethin' if he saw you in this outfit.
6085	6089	I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you!
6089	6094	- You look really good. No, something in the shade. - Over there.
6094	6096	You clean up real nice.
6096	6100	You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard lookin' like you do, not that you ever did.
6100	6103	Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.
6103	6106	Yeah.
6106	6110	- So, when does he leave? - Tomorrow.
6110	6114	- You get to keep the clothes? - Yeah.
6114	6119	Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again.
6119	6124	But I think, I think definitely no. It's just another week, right?
6124	6127	- "Definitely no. " - Yeah.
6127	6129	Oh, no.
6129	6131	What?
6131	6134	- I know this weepy look on your face. - Oh, no, you don't!
6134	6137	- You fell in love with him. - No. Kit, please. Stop it.
6137	6139	- You've fallen in love with him? - Kit!
6139	6142	- Did you kiss him? On the mouth? - Uh, yeah, I did.
6142	6144	- You kissed him on the mouth? - I did. It was nice.
6144	6147	You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything?
6147	6152	Look, I'm not stupid, okay? I'm- I'm not in love with him.
6152	6154	I just- I like him.
6154	6156	You like him?
6156	6159	- Yeah. - You definitely like him.
6161	6163	Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy.
6164	6167	- Who's gonna break my heart, right? - Oh, no. Come on.
6167	6169	You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right?
6169	6172	Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together.
6172	6174	Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know.
6175	6178	Anyway, it could work. It happens.
6179	6182	When does it happen, Kit?
6182	6184	When does it really happen? Who does it really work out for?
6184	6186	Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel? No!
6186	6188	Those were very specific cases of crackheads.
6188	6191	I just wanna know who it works out for.
6191	6194	You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for.
6194	6196	- Name someone? - Yeah, one person that it worked out for.
6196	6199	- You want me to give you a name or something. - Yeah.
6199	6201	Oh, God, the pressure of a name.
6204	6206	Cinder-fuckin'- rella.
6212	6215	If you do, I'll give you a piggy-back ride when you-
6215	6219	See, I- Not quick enough for the old man!
6221	6223	Oh! Hah!
6223	6226	Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy.
6226	6230	Oh, Zachary! Too many doughnuts.
6239	6243	Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.
6243	6245	Mr. Lewis is now listening.
6245	6250	I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer...
6251	6252	on one condition.
6253	6258	I'm not so concerned about me, but the people who are working for me.
6258	6260	It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of.
6260	6263	Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts in front of you.
6263	6266	- If you look at- - Excuse me, Phil.
6266	6271	Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.
6271	6273	Thank you.
6275	6278	All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait outside.
6280	6282	You too, Phil.
6282	6285	What do you mean?
6285	6287	I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.
6289	6294	- Why does he get to stay? - Please, please.
6298	6301	- I'll be right outside. - Good.
6318	6320	- Is that better? - It's all right.
6320	6324	- Would you like a cup of coffee? - Black.
6326	6329	Mr. Morse,
6329	6332	my interests in your company have changed.
6332	6337	What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis?
6337	6340	Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart.
6340	6343	But I don't want anyone else to, either.
6343	6347	And it is still extremely vulnerable.
6347	6352	So I find myself... in unfamiliar territory.
6352	6354	I wanna help you.
6354	6357	Why?
6366	6370	Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with your company.
6370	6372	What about our Navy contracts?
6372	6377	Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little bit.
6377	6379	- You're very good at it. - Thank you very much.
6380	6383	It's my job.
6383	6386	I think we can leave the details up to the others.
6386	6390	I find this hard to say without sounding condescending, but...
6390	6394	I'm proud of you.
6395	6397	Thank you.
6399	6402	I think we can let in the other suits now.
6403	6408	Let's continue the meeting.
6408	6410	Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.
6410	6413	Edward, please, what was this all about? Hmm?
6413	6416	It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.
6419	6422	Hold it. Hold it. These aren't signed!
6422	6426	These aren't signed! Could someone please tell me what the fuck is going on here?
6426	6429	Mr. Lewis and I are going to build ships together.
6429	6432	Great big ships.
6434	6436	You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk.
6436	6439	- Just stay here for a while. I'll be back. - Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.
6462	6466	Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.
6466	6469	Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.
6469	6474	No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.
6476	6480	No, if Edward were with me-
6480	6485	When. Actually, when... Edward was with me,
6485	6488	he didn't blow off billion dollar deals!
6488	6493	I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.
6493	6496	- Mind if I have a drink? - No.
6496	6498	No, thank you.
6500	6503	Well, I'll just wait.
6503	6507	Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.
6509	6513	You know,
6513	6515	this is not home.
6515	6518	This is, uh, a hotel room.
6518	6521	And, uh, you are not...
6521	6524	the little woman.
6524	6527	You're a hooker.
6527	6530	Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know?
6530	6534	Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars.
6534	6537	Because I have to be very honest with you.
6537	6540	Right now, Vivian, right now I really do care. I really do.
6540	6544	And right now I am really pissed, you know?
6544	6547	Right now I am just freaking out.
6548	6551	So maybe if I screw you, huh,
6551	6553	and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward.
6553	6557	- Hey, get off me! - Hey, hey! Goddamn it!
6557	6560	- Ow! - Ow!
6560	6563	- Come on! Come on! I'll pay for it. - Get off me!
6563	6565	- How much is it? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks? - Get off me! Get off me!
6565	6568	- Fifty? You a $50 whore, Vivian? - What are you doing?
6568	6571	- Get off! - Stop. I don't want to hurt you! Stop it!
6571	6573	You already did, Edward!
6573	6576	- Out. Out of here. - All right, all right.
6576	6580	Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn- Aah!
6582	6585	- Aah! Damn. - Shit. Goddamn!
6587	6589	- I think you broke my nose. - Get outta here.
6589	6592	What is wrong with you? Come on, Edward! I gave you ten years!
6592	6597	- I devoted my whole life to you! - That's bullshit.
6597	6600	This is such bullshit! It's the kill you love, not me!
6600	6603	I made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved.
6603	6605	Now get outta here!
6607	6608	Get out!
6618	6621	Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek?
6621	6625	Wham! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode.
6625	6629	What do they do? Do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this?
6629	6631	Is that- Ow.
6634	6636	Not all guys hit.
6639	6642	I heard about what you did with Morse.
6644	6647	- That was a business decision. - It was good.
6649	6651	It felt good.
6654	6657	I think this is okay.
6657	6659	I gotta get going.
6659	6661	Yes, I noticed you're packed.
6661	6664	Why are you leaving now?
6666	6670	Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours,
6670	6672	thinkin' he can treat me like Stuckey,
6672	6675	thinking that it's allowed.
6675	6679	What are you gonna do? You gonna beat up everybody?
6679	6682	That's not why you're leaving.
6683	6685	Look, you made me a really nice offer.
6685	6687	Look, you made me a really nice offer.
6687	6691	And a few months ago, no problem.
6691	6693	But now everything is different, and you've changed that.
6694	6697	And you can't change back.
6697	6699	I want more.
6701	6704	I know about wanting more.
6704	6706	I invented the concept.
6706	6710	The question is how much more.
6712	6714	I want the fairy tale.
6716	6718	Impossible relationships.
6720	6725	My special gift is impossible relationships.
6737	6741	- Thank you. - You're welcome.
6743	6748	If you ever need anything- dental floss, whatever- you give me a call.
6753	6755	I had a good time.
6755	6757	Me too.
6767	6769	Do you want me to get you a bellboy?
6769	6772	- No, I got it. - I'll carry this.
6772	6774	Thanks.
6781	6785	Stay. Stay the night with me.
6785	6788	And not because I'm paying you, but because you want to.
6793	6796	I can't.
6802	6804	Good-bye.
6811	6815	I think you have a lot of special gifts.
6816	6818	Mmm.
6828	6830	- I didn't do it, sir. - No, no. I didn't say that.
6831	6834	I want you to call maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate authority.
6834	6836	- Yes, sir. - Hi, Barney.
6837	6840	Miss Vivian. Thank you.
6842	6843	I wanted to say good-bye.
6844	6847	Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.
6847	6851	Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most of the time.
6853	6855	Have you arranged for transportation?
6855	6857	- I'm gonna call a cab. - Allow me.
6857	6859	- Darryl. - Yes, sir.
6859	6862	Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.
6862	6864	Yes, sir.
6871	6873	It's been a pleasure knowing you.
6873	6876	Come and visit us again sometime.
6877	6879	Stay cool.
6892	6895	# Lay a whisper #
6895	6898	# On my pillow #
6898	6901	# Leave the winter #
6901	6904	# On the ground #
6904	6907	# I wake up lonely #
6907	6910	# The stare of silence #
6910	6913	# In the bedroom #
6913	6916	# And all around #
6916	6919	# Touch me now #
6919	6922	# I close my eyes #
6922	6925	# And dream away #
6927	6930	# It must have been love #
6930	6933	# But it's over now #
6933	6936	# It must have been good #
6936	6939	# But I lost it somehow #
6939	6942	# It must have been love #
6942	6945	# But it's over now #
6945	6947	# From the moment we touched #
6948	6951	# 'Til the time had run out ##
6969	6971	Is that everything, sir?
6971	6973	Yes. Yes, that's everything.
6973	6975	- I'll meet you downstairs, sir. - Thank you.
6978	6980	We look so dopey.
6982	6985	San Francisco's not that great, you know.
6985	6989	It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.
6989	6991	I'll wear a sweater.
6991	6993	What are you gonna do there?
6993	6996	Get a job. Finish high school.
6996	7000	I got things I can do. I used to make pretty good grades in high school.
7000	7003	Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.
7007	7009	Sure you won't come with me?
7009	7012	And leave all this? Not in a million.
7013	7016	Come here.
7020	7023	Whoa. Whoa. What is this?
7024	7028	It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund.
7028	7030	We think you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.
7030	7035	You do? You think I got potential?
7035	7039	Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay?
7039	7042	Okay.
7042	7044	Take care of you.
7044	7046	No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.
7049	7051	What time's your bus?
7051	7053	An hour.
7053	7056	Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy.
7056	7060	- So, take care of you. - Whoa.
7064	7066	Mr. Lewis.
7066	7069	You don't have any messages for me, do you?
7069	7071	No, I'm afraid not, sir.
7074	7076	I'll need a car to the airport also.
7076	7078	Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.
7079	7081	- Darryl, the limousine out front, please? - Yes, sir.
7081	7084	Thank you, Darryl.
7085	7087	- One last thing. If you could possibly... - Yes.
7087	7090	- return this to Fred's for me, please. - Yes, of course.
7090	7093	May I, sir?
7093	7095	Of course, please.
7102	7105	It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.
7108	7112	You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.
7116	7118	I'll take care of it.
7119	7122	Thank you, Mr. Thompson.
7134	7136	Your plane is leaving as scheduled, sir,
7136	7139	and you should be back in New York on time.
7150	7153	I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than Vivian...
7153	7155	because I've got this beauty course I'm looking into.
7155	7157	I'm not gonna be there that much, you know?
7157	7159	'Cause you can't- You just can't turn tricks forever.
7159	7162	You gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal?
7162	7164	Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.
7164	7168	- Help you, love? - There you go. Thank you very much.
7168	7170	So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in?
7170	7173	No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was movin' out.
7200	7202	Vivian!
7202	7204	Vivian.
7209	7213	Princess Vivian! Come down!
7217	7220	- Had to be the top floor, right? - It's the best.
7220	7222	All right. I'm coming up.
7257	7262	So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her?
7262	7265	She rescues him right back.
7276	7279	Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream?
