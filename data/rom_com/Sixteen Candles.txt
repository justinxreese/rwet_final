402	406	No, but they could have at least said "happy birthday." It was just like any other day.
406	408	Why don't you remind them?
408	411	They'll feel some massive guilt. It could be highly profitable.
411	413	I wouldn't stoop to remind them.

2939	2942	Where are you, Jake?
2942	2945	Jakey, have you stopped loving me?
2948	2950	Leave me alone.
2961	2966	What? I'm sorry, I don't do that.
2966	2968	Yes, you do. I know.
2968	2972	Come on. [Caroline] Trace. You guys.
2972	2974	[Giggling] Would you help me, please?
2974	2978	Oh, shit! Come on, you guys. I'm your prom queen.
2978	2981	[Laughing] Trace, you guys, I'm serious.
2981	2983	Come on. I need help.
2983	2986	Okay. I need help too.
2986	2989	What is the problem? Several things.
2991	2993	[Giggling]
2994	2998	Okay. We'll help you. [Mumbling]
2998	3001	Don't go away, Caroline, baby.
3004	3006	[Rings]
3006	3009	Hello? Hello?
3009	3013	Listen, I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.
3017	3019	Yes, hello, sir. Um...
3019	3022	Are you the little bugger that's been calling up...
3022	3024	and then hanging up?
3024	3027	Would it be possible to tell me if there is a Samantha Baker there?
3027	3030	And if so, sir, may I converse with her briefly?
3030	3034	Yes, it is. And no, you may not.
3034	3036	Might I leave a message, sir?
3038	3041	He wants to leave a message for Sam.
3041	3043	Here, give me that phone.
3045	3047	Now, you listen to me, mister.
3047	3051	God did not put me on this earth to be awakened by filthy suggestions...
3051	3054	from a foul-mouthed hooligan like you.
3054	3057	And as for our granddaughter, I'm sure she has more than enough sense...
3057	3059	to stay clear of the likes of you!
3059	3061	Now, good night and good-bye!
3062	3063	[Dial Tone Humming]
3067	3069	That was great. [Sighs]
3069	3073	Sam's lucky she has us, Howard. Yeah.
3073	3076	Even if she doesn't appreciate us.
3078	3081	Do you promise you won't get mad? No, I love you.
3082	3084	[Laughing] Okay, close your eyes.
3085	3088	Scalpel. Scalpel.

3220	3224	[Grunting] Jake!
3226	3228	Sam.
3229	3230	Sweetheart?
3232	3236	Daddy? Hi, kiddo.
3236	3239	What's wrong? Nothing. Everything's fine.
3240	3243	I was just upstairs, and I couldn't sleep.
3246	3249	I feel like a real jerk, honey.
3249	3251	We forgot your birthday.
3255	3258	I bet you're really P.O. 'd, huh?
3258	3262	No, it's okay. I'm not really all that upset anymore.
3264	3268	This wedding is really turning this entire house inside out.
3268	3272	And I just came down to tell you that we did remember.
3273	3275	Thanks, Dad.
3276	3278	Happy birthday.
3286	3289	[Sighs]
3289	3291	Is something else wrong?
3291	3293	No, why?
3293	3296	I don't know, I just get the feeling that something's bothering you.
3296	3299	Something other than your birthday.
3299	3302	No, I'm fine. Really.
3307	3310	I think I know what it is.
3312	3314	It has to do with a certain guy?
3321	3324	I know, honey. I know.
3328	3331	We're all upset that Ginny's marrying a bohunk.
3336	3340	What's the matter? [Sighs]
3340	3342	I meantJake.
3342	3344	Jake? [Sighs]
3344	3347	Wait a minute. I thought she said his name was Rudy. Forget it.
3348	3350	Forget what? Who's Jake?
3352	3354	He's a boy, Daddy. It's nothing.
3354	3357	Okay? Just forget it, please.
3357	3359	Come on, Sam. We're not communicating.
3359	3363	[Sighs] It's extremely embarrassing, okay?
3364	3366	What's embarrassing?
3366	3369	Sitting in the dark with your dad, telling him about your love life.
3371	3373	I'm afraid you lost me again, Sam.
3376	3380	Jake is a senior, and he's beautiful and perfect.
3380	3383	I like him a real lot, and he doesn't like me. Okay?
3383	3385	Oh.
3386	3388	And he's got this incredible girlfriend.
3388	3391	I'm just this ridiculous dork that's following him around like a puppy.
3391	3394	Why do you think you're a dork?
3394	3397	I don't think you're a dork. I don't think Mom thinks you're a dork.
3397	3400	- Mike thinks I'm a dork. - Mike is a dork.
3400	3403	[Sighs] But so am I.
3403	3407	Well, if it's any consolation, I love you.
3407	3412	And if this guy can't see in you all the beautiful and wonderful things that I see,
3412	3414	then he's got the problem.
3414	3416	I know. It just hurts.
3418	3420	That's why they call them crushes.
3420	3424	If they were easy, they'd call 'em something else.
3424	3426	[Sighs] But if I were Ginny,
3426	3429	I'd have this guy crawling on his knees.
3429	3432	Well, let me tell you something about Ginny.
3432	3436	Now, I love her as much as I love you. But she's a different person.
3436	3439	Sometimes I worry about her.
3439	3441	When you're given things kind of easily,
3441	3444	you don't always appreciate them.
3444	3447	With you, I'm not worried.
3447	3451	When it happens to you, Samantha, it'll be forever.
3456	3461	Well, I don't think I'll be able to sleep if I don't feel this little talk has helped you.
3461	3464	So would you be a sport and lie to me? [Chuckles]
3464	3466	Yeah, sure, Daddy.
3466	3469	[Kiss] Good night, sweetheart. Good night.
3475	3477	Oh, one more thing, sweetheart.
3477	3480	What?
3480	3483	When you do find the right guy, don't let him boss you around.
3485	3489	Make sure he knows you wear the pants in the family.
3493	3495	These are really hers? Yeah.
3495	3497	How did you get 'em?
3498	3500	She gave 'em to me.
3500	3503	Did you... No! No, Jake.
3503	3505	She's crying for you.
3505	3508	I told her you asked about her. Right? The girl freaked.
3508	3512	She had a hissy. She thinks you're the cat's meow. Really?
3512	3514	Yeah. She came up to me in the gym tonight.
3514	3517	She looked at me like I was a leper.
3517	3519	Girls'll do that, Jake.
3519	3522	You see, they know guys are, like, in perpetual heat, right?
3522	3525	They know this shit. And they enjoy pumping us up.
3525	3528	It's pure power politics, I'm tellin' you.
3528	3530	I thought she hated my guts.
3530	3533	Games, Jake. Silly, torturous games.
3534	3537	You know how many times a week I go without lunch because some bitch borrows my lunch money?
3537	3540	Any halfway decent girl can rob me blind!
3540	3543	Because I'm too torqued up to say no.
3543	3545	It's heinous, I'm telling you.
3545	3547	You better not be dickin' me around.
3547	3549	It'd be a major downer to try and get together...
3549	3552	and find out she really does think I'm a slime.
3552	3555	Jake, would I dick you?
3555	3557	Let me put it to you this way.
3557	3559	What happens to me if I dick you?
3559	3561	[Chuckles] I'd kick your ass.
3561	3564	Right. So why would I lie?
3564	3567	But I feel compelled to mention, Jake,
3567	3570	if all you want is a piece of ass, I mean,
3570	3574	I'll either do it myself, or get someone bigger than me,
3574	3576	to kick your ass.
3576	3580	I mean, not many girls in contemporary American society today...
3581	3584	would give their underwear to help a geek like me.
3584	3587	I can get a piece of ass anytime I want.
3587	3590	Shit, I got Caroline in my bedroom right now, passed out cold.
3590	3594	I could violate her ten different ways if I wanted to.
3594	3597	What are you waiting for? I don't know.
3597	3600	She's beautiful, and she's built and all that.
3600	3603	[Sighs] I'm just not interested anymore.
3603	3606	Does that really matter, guy? Yeah, it matters.
3606	3610	She's totally insensitive. Look what she did to my house.
3611	3613	She doesn't know shit about love.
3613	3615	Only thing she cares about is partying.
3616	3618	I want a serious girlfriend.
3618	3621	Somebody I can love, that's gonna love me back.
3623	3626	Is that psycho? [Spits]
3627	3629	That's beautiful, Jake.
3629	3632	I think a ton of guys feel the same way as you do. Really?
3632	3635	Yeah. It's just they don't... They don't have the balls to admit it.
3635	3637	You know? They're just... They're wimps.
3639	3641	Samantha's, uh... She's really special, you know?
3641	3643	I'll make a deal with you.
3643	3648	Let me keep these. I'll let you take Caroline home.
3648	3651	But you gotta make sure she gets home. You can't leave her in some parking lot somewhere.
3651	3654	Okay?
3654	3656	Jake, I'm only a freshman.
3656	3659	So? She's so blitzed, she won't know the difference.
3659	3663	Jake, I don't have a car. You can take mine.
3663	3667	Jake, I don't have a license. I trust you.
3671	3675	Jake, I'd love to. I can't. Want a pretzel?
3675	3678	You sure? Positive.
3680	3683	[Grunts]
3690	3692	I got her. You got her?
3692	3694	Yeah.
3704	3706	Is this, uh, your car, Jake? No, this is my dad's car.
3707	3709	You said you couldn't drive a stick.
3709	3712	This is a mother...
3712	3714	This is a Rolls-Royce, Jake.
3714	3717	So? So! So.
3717	3720	I heard the grill alone cost five grand on this.
3720	3724	Five grand! I don't have five grand.
3724	3726	Then don't hit anything. Ahh, don't hit anything.
3726	3728	Do you want to do this or not?
3728	3730	No.

3758	3760	Mm-hmm. Mmm.

3773	3775	Who are you? I'm him.
3781	3783	Oh.
