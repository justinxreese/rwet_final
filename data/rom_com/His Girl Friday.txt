67	68	Copy boy!
70	73	- Make it snappy. - Where's the rest of this story?
73	74	Morning Post.
74	77	City desk? Just a moment and I'll connect you.
77	80	If anybody asks for me, I'm down at the courthouse.
80	82	- Elevator! - Going down.
87	89	- Hello, Hildy. - Hi, Skinny.
90	92	Hello, Ruth, Maisie.
92	96	- Is the lord of the universe in? - Yes, in a bad humor.
96	98	Somebody must've stolen the crown jewel.
98	100	- Shall we announce you? - I'll blow my own horn.
101	104	Bruce, wait here. I'll be back in ten minutes.
104	107	Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
108	109	What did you say?
112	113	Go on.
114	115	Well, go ahead.
116	119	I just said, "Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you".
119	123	I heard you. I like it. That's why I asked you to say it again.
123	125	I like being spoiled.
125	127	The man I'm going in to see did little spoiling.
127	130	I'd like to spoil him. Want me to go with you?
130	133	- I can handle it. - Lf it gets rough, I'm here.
133	135	I'll come running, partner.
136	137	- Hello, Jim. - Hello, Hildy!
137	140	- How are you? - Welcome back.
140	142	Hello, Hildy, how have you been?
144	146	Beatrice, how's "Advice to the Lovelorn"?
146	149	- Fine. My cat had kittens again. - Your own fault.
150	152	Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.
152	154	Mildred, you still around?
156	158	A little more around the chin, boss.
159	160	What do you want?
160	162	Your ex-wife is here.
164	166	Hello, Hildy.
166	167	Hello, Walter.
168	171	Hello, Louie. How's the big slot machine king?
171	174	I ain't doing that no more. I'm retired. You know what I mean?
174	176	- Walter. - I'm busy!
177	180	The governor didn't sign that reprieve.
180	183	Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies and makes a sucker out of us.
184	186	What are you going to do?
186	187	- Phone the governor. - I can't.
188	190	- Why not? - He's out fishing.
190	193	- How many places are there? - At least two, Atlantic and Pacific.
193	195	That simplifies it, doesn't it?
195	197	- Get him on the phone. - And say what?
197	199	Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.
200	203	Tell him if he reprieves Earl Williams, we'll support him for senator.
203	205	Tell him the Morning Post will be behind him.
206	207	- You can't do that. - Why not?
207	209	We've been a Democratic paper for over 20 years.
210	213	After we get the reprieve, we'll be Democratic again.
213	214	Go on, Duffy, get going.
214	217	The Morning Post expects every editor to do his duty.
218	220	You too, Louie. Get out of here.
225	227	Well, Walter, I see you're still at it.
227	231	First time I double-crossed a governor. What can I do for you?
231	232	Would you mind if I sat down?
233	236	There's a lamp burning in the window for you. Here.
236	239	I jumped out of that window a long time ago, Walter.
242	244	May I have one of those?
245	246	Thank you.
249	251	And a match?
251	253	Thank you.
258	260	- How long is it? - How long is what?
260	261	You know what.
261	264	How long is it since we've seen each other?
265	267	Well, let's see.
267	271	I spent six weeks in Reno, then Bermuda. About four months.
271	273	Seems like yesterday to me.
274	277	Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy. Been seeing me in your dreams?
278	281	Mama doesn't dream about you. You wouldn't know her now.
281	283	Yes, I would. I'd know you anytime.
283	285	Any place, anywhere.
286	289	You're repeating yourself. You said that the night you proposed.
289	290	You still remember it.
290	293	If I didn't remember it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
293	295	I sort of wish you hadn't.
295	297	- What? - Divorced me.
297	300	It makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It gives him...
300	302	...a feeling he wasn't wanted.
302	304	Junior, that's what divorces are for.
304	308	Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned idea divorces last forever.
308	311	"Till death do us part". Divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays.
311	314	Just a few words mumbled over you by a judge.
314	317	We've got something between us nothing can change.
318	321	- I suppose you're right in a way. - Sure, I'm right.
321	324	- I am fond of you, you know. - Thattagirl!
324	327	I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
328	330	You must meet my mother. She'd like that phrase.
331	335	Then why'd you promise not to fight the divorce and then gum up the works?
336	338	I meant to let you go, but you know...
338	340	...you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
340	343	A big lummox like you, hiring an airplane to write:
343	347	"Hildy, don't be hasty. Remember my dimple. Walter".
348	350	It delayed our divorce while the judge watched it.
350	354	Not to brag, but I've still got the dimple, and in the same place.
355	358	I acted like any husband who didn't want to see his home broken up.
358	361	- What home? - Remember the home I promised you?
361	365	Sure I do. The one we were to have right after the honeymoon.
365	366	That honeymoon!
367	370	Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine would have a cave-in?
370	373	I intended to be with you on our honeymoon.
373	376	Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom...
377	380	...I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky.
380	381	You don't deny it?
381	384	No. We beat the whole country on that story!
384	387	Suppose we did! That isn't what I got married for!
387	390	What is the good? Look, Walter.
390	394	I came to tell you to stop phoning me a dozen times a day...
394	395	...sending me 20 telegrams...
395	398	I write a beautiful telegram, don't I?
398	399	Are you going to listen?
399	402	What's the use of fighting? I'll tell you what you do.
402	406	Come back to work on the paper, and if we can't get along...
406	408	...we'll get married again.
408	411	- What? - Sure, I haven't any hard feelings.
411	414	Walter, you're wonderful in a loathsome sort of way.
414	417	- Be quiet so I can say what I have to. - Tell me over lunch.
418	419	I have a lunch date.
419	420	- Break it. - I can't.
421	423	Hands off! Are you playing osteopath?
423	424	Temper, temper.
424	429	You are no longer my husband and no longer my boss.
429	430	And you won't be my boss.
430	433	- What does that mean? - Just what I say.
433	435	You're not coming back to work?
435	437	You're right for the first time today.
438	440	- Got a better offer? - You bet!
440	443	Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get.
443	444	Stop hamming.
445	449	Five years ago, you were a college girl. I took a doll-faced hick!
449	451	You wouldn't have if I wasn't doll-faced.
451	454	It was a novelty to have a face to look at without shuddering.
454	458	I made you a great reporter. You won't be as good on any other paper.
458	461	We're a team. The paper needs both of us!
461	463	Sold American!
463	465	- All right, go ahead. - Listen, Walter, please.
466	469	The paper's going to have to get along without me. So will you.
469	470	It didn't work out.
471	475	It would have worked if you'd been satisfied as editor and reporter.
475	477	You had to marry me and spoil everything.
477	480	I wasn't satisfied? I suppose I proposed to you!
481	483	Practically! Making eyes at me until I broke down.
483	487	"Oh, Walter!" I was tight when I proposed to you.
487	490	If you'd been a gentleman, you'd have forgotten about it.
490	492	You used to pitch better than that.
493	495	Hello. What?
495	497	Sweeney? What can I do for you?
497	500	What? Wait a minute. I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.
500	503	Sweeney, you can't do that to me. Not today, of all days!
503	506	What's the matter with you? Are you a loony?
507	510	Now, listen, Sweeney. This is no time...
511	516	All right, I suppose so. If you have to, you have to.
516	518	- He had to. - Everything happens to me.
519	522	365 days in a year, and this has to be the day.
522	523	What's wrong?
523	524	- Sweeney. - Dead?
525	528	He might as well be. He picks today to have a baby!
528	530	Not on purpose?
530	533	He's supposed to cover the Earl Williams case, and where is he?
533	536	Walking up and down in a hospital. Is there no honor?
537	538	Haven't you got anybody else?
539	541	Nobody else on the paper can write.
542	543	This'll break me.
543	544	Unless...
544	545	Hildy!
546	548	- You've got to help me. - Not a chance, Walter.
549	550	Get out of here, Duffy!
550	551	Save your breath.
551	553	This'll bring us back together again.
553	555	That's what I'm afraid of.
555	558	This is bigger than anything else.
558	559	Do it for the paper.
559	560	Scram, Svengali.
560	562	If you won't do it for love, how about money?
563	564	I'll raise you $25 a week.
564	566	Listen to me, you baboon...
566	568	I'll make it $35 and not a cent more.
568	569	Listen!
569	571	How much will the other paper pay?
571	572	There's no other paper.
572	575	Then the raise is off. You go back to your old salary.
575	577	Trying to blackjack me.
577	579	- I'm busy. - Take a good look at it.
579	582	Do you know what it is? It's an engagement ring.
585	586	Engagement ring?
589	591	I tried to tell you right away...
592	594	...but you would start reminiscing.
594	597	I'm getting married, and I'm getting as far away...
597	600	...from the newspaper business as I can get.
601	602	I'm through.
603	606	- You can get married, but not quit. - No? Why not?
606	608	I know what quitting would mean.
608	610	- What? - It would kill you.
610	613	- You can't sell me that. - You're a newspaperman.
614	616	I want to go someplace where I can be a woman.
616	619	- You mean, be a traitor. - A traitor to what?
619	621	To journalism. You're a journalist!
621	623	A journalist? What does that mean?
624	626	Peeking through keyholes, chasing fire engines...
627	629	...waking people up in the night to ask questions...
629	633	...stealing pictures off old ladies? I know all about reporters.
633	636	Buttinskies running around with no money, and for what?
636	640	So a million people will know what's going on. Why, I...
641	643	What's the use?
643	645	Walter, you wouldn't know what it means...
645	649	...to want to be respectable and live a halfway normal life.
650	653	The point is, I'm through.
655	657	Where did you meet this man?
657	658	Bermuda.
658	659	Rich?
659	663	He's not what you'd call rich. He makes about $5000 a year.
663	665	- What's his line? - He's in the insurance business.
666	667	Insurance business?
668	669	That's a good honest business.
669	672	Sure, it's honest. It's also adventurous, romantic.
672	676	I can't picture you being surrounded by policies...
676	679	I can, and I like it, what's more.
679	681	Besides, he forgets the office when he's with me.
682	684	He doesn't treat me like an errand boy.
684	685	He treats me like a woman.
685	688	He does? How did I treat you? Like a water buffalo?
688	691	I don't know from buffaloes, but I do know about him.
691	694	He's kind, he's sweet, and he's considerate.
694	696	He wants a home and children.
696	699	Sounds like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
700	701	Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.
701	703	I knew a Baldwin once, a horse thief.
703	705	Couldn't be the same fellow, could it?
705	709	You are not talking about the man I'm marrying tomorrow.
710	712	Tomorrow? As soon as that?
717	721	At last, I got out what I came up here to tell you.
722	725	Guess there isn't any more to the story.
726	727	So long, Walter.
727	728	So long, Hildy.
729	730	Better luck to you next time.
730	732	Thanks.
737	740	Well, you kind of took the wind out of my sail.
740	744	I just want to wish you everything I couldn't give you.
747	751	This other fellow. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to see him.
751	754	I'm particular about whom my wife marries.
754	756	Where is he?
756	759	He's right on the job, waiting for me out there.
759	761	Do you mind if I meet him?
761	764	- It wouldn't do any good. - You're not afraid, are you?
764	765	Of course not.
766	769	Let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
770	771	He's better.
771	773	- Then what does he want with you? - You got me.
773	775	Back in an hour, Mildred.
775	778	I am sorry, Hildy. I suppose Bruce... What's his name?
779	780	I suppose he opens doors for you?
780	783	And with a lady, he takes his hat off.
783	784	I am sorry.
784	786	When he walks with a lady, he waits for her.
787	789	In that case...
791	792	Allow me.
795	798	I can see my wife picked out the right husband for herself.
799	802	There must be some mistake. I'm already married.
802	804	Already married?
805	807	You should have told me.
807	809	Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin.
809	810	- No, my name... - Mr. Burns.
810	813	I'm terribly busy. What did you say, Mr. Baldwin?
813	815	- Mr. Burns. - My name is...
815	818	I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin. I didn't hear what you said, sir.
819	820	- My name is... - Mr. Burns...
820	822	- What is it with you? - I'm Bruce Baldwin.
823	825	Can't you see that I'm... You're Bruce Baldwin!
825	827	Well, who is he? Who are you?
827	828	My name's Pete Davis.
829	831	Mr. Davis, is this any concern of yours?
831	834	From now on, keep your nose out of my affairs.
834	836	Don't let it happen again.
836	840	I'm terribly sorry about this mistake. This is indeed a pleasure.
840	844	That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce... do you mind if I call you Bruce?
845	847	- We're almost related. - No, not at all.
848	850	You see, my wife... That is, your wife.
850	854	Hildy, you led me to expect you were marrying a much older man.
854	856	What did I say?
856	860	Don't worry about it. I realize you didn't mean old in years.
861	864	- Do you always carry an umbrella? - It looked cloudy this morning.
864	866	That's right. Rubbers too, I hope.
867	870	Thattaboy! A man ought to be prepared.
870	871	We'd better run along.
872	873	- We'd better go. - Where are we going?
873	875	I'm taking you two to lunch. Didn't you tell him?
876	877	No, she didn't.
877	881	I guess she just wanted to surprise you, Bruce.
881	882	After you, Hildy.
882	884	You're wasting your time.
884	886	No, I'm glad to do it.
890	892	Hello, Gus.
892	893	It's Hildy!
893	895	It's none other. How are things?
895	896	I can't complain.
897	899	I can. I'm hungry. A roast beef sandwich...
899	900	- Sorry. - ...on white bread.
901	902	Over there, Bruce.
902	904	- And you, Hildy? - I'll have the same.
905	907	- And you, sir? - Yes, that's all right for me.
907	910	Bring some mustard too, Gus.
912	915	So you two are going to get married?
915	918	- How does it feel, Bruce? - It feels awful good.
918	919	You're getting a great girl.
920	921	I realize that.
921	923	Things have been different since I met Hildy.
924	926	I've never met anyone quite like her.
926	928	Everybody else I've ever known...
928	932	...you could always tell ahead of time what they would say or do.
932	936	But Hildy's not like that. You can't tell that about her.
936	937	That's nice.
937	940	You're getting something else too: A great newspaperman.
940	942	No orchids, Walter.
942	946	One of the best I ever knew. Sorry to see her go. Darn sorry.
946	947	I'd like to believe you.
948	950	I mean it. If you ever want to come back...
950	952	Which I won't.
952	955	In spite of everything, there's only one man I'd work for.
956	958	I'd kill you if you worked for anybody else.
958	960	Hear that? That's my diploma.
960	963	It must be quite a business if it's...
963	965	Are you sure you want to quit?
965	966	What do you mean?
966	968	If there is any doubt about it...
968	969	...or if there's anything...
970	972	No, this is your chance to have a home...
972	974	...and to be, like you said, a human being.
975	976	I'll make you take that chance.
976	979	Certainly. Why, I wouldn't let her stay.
979	983	She deserves all this happiness. All the things I couldn't give her.
984	985	All she ever wanted was a home.
985	987	I'll certainly try.
987	989	I know you will, Bruce.
989	990	- Where will you live? - Albany.
990	993	- Got a family up there? - Just my mother.
994	996	Just your mother. You're going to live with her?
996	998	Just for the first year.
999	1000	That will be nice.
1000	1004	Yes, a home with mother, in Albany too.
1005	1008	Mighty nice little town. It's the state capital.
1008	1011	I know. We were there once.
1014	1018	Will you ever forget the night you brought the governor to the hotel?
1018	1020	You see, I was in taking a bath.
1020	1023	Well, I came walking out without...
1025	1027	She didn't know I was in town.
1027	1030	Bruce, how is business up there? Any better?
1030	1032	Albany's a mighty good insurance town.
1032	1035	Most people take it out pretty early in life.
1035	1037	I can see why they would.
1037	1039	Statistics show that most of...
1039	1042	I've got a feeling I ought to have taken out a little insurance.
1042	1045	That really doesn't matter now that Hildy and I have...
1046	1048	...well, you know, we've... Does it?
1048	1050	What do you think?
1050	1053	It might have been a good idea if I had taken out insurance.
1053	1055	I honestly feel that way.
1055	1058	I'm in one business that really helps people.
1058	1061	Of course, we don't help you much while you're alive, but afterward.
1061	1064	- That's what counts. - Sure.
1065	1066	I don't get it.
1067	1068	Nice going.
1068	1071	So sorry, Gus. My foot must have slipped.
1071	1073	That's all right. What would you like to drink?
1073	1074	Coffee.
1074	1077	- Shall I put some rum in the coffee? - Sure.
1077	1078	Me too, Gus, please.
1079	1080	- Not for me. - Go on, Bruce.
1080	1084	I have a lot to do. I have to buy the tickets, check the baggage...
1084	1085	Do it tomorrow.
1086	1090	We're leaving today at four o'clock, taking the sleeper for Albany.
1092	1095	You're leaving today at four o'clock?
1095	1097	- That's only two hours. - That's not much time.
1097	1099	I've got a lot to do. I want to...
1099	1102	Isn't that silly? All down over my front.
1102	1105	- That's nothing new. Here. - Never mind, I'll get Gus.
1106	1108	Gus, do something about this, will you?
1108	1111	Call me to the telephone when I get back to the table.
1111	1114	Thanks, Gus, that's fine.
1114	1117	I'm terribly sorry about that. That was silly, wasn't it?
1117	1120	Let me get that straight. I must have misunderstood you.
1120	1124	You're taking the sleeper today, then getting married tomorrow?
1124	1126	Well, it's not like that.
1126	1127	What is it like?
1127	1129	Poor Walter. He'll toss and turn all night.
1130	1132	Perhaps we'd better tell him. Mother's coming too.
1132	1134	Your mother kicked the bucket...
1134	1135	No, my mother.
1136	1138	Your mother? Well, that relieves my mind.
1138	1140	It was cruel to let you suffer so.
1141	1143	Isn't Walter sweet? Always wanting to protect me.
1143	1147	I admit I wasn't much of a husband, but you can always count on me.
1147	1151	I don't think she'll need you much. I aim to do the protecting myself.
1151	1153	Mr. Burns, telephone.
1153	1154	For me?
1154	1156	That's strange.
1156	1157	Pardon me.
1160	1162	He's not such a bad fellow.
1162	1165	No, he should make some girl real happy.
1165	1166	Slaphappy.
1167	1169	He's not the man for you. I can see that.
1169	1172	But I sort of like him. He's got charm.
1172	1175	He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
1177	1179	Hello? Duffy, listen.
1180	1183	Any way we can stop the 4:00 train to Albany from leaving?
1183	1185	- We might dynamite it. - Could we?
1185	1187	Maybe we couldn't.
1188	1189	All right, get this.
1189	1192	Send Sweeney out of town on two weeks' vacation right away.
1193	1196	Keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back.
1196	1198	She doesn't know it yet, but she's staying.
1198	1202	Tell Louie to stick around the office. I may need him. Goodbye.
1204	1205	Thanks, Gus.
1205	1207	- This is bad business. - What's the matter?
1207	1209	The Earl Williams case.
1209	1210	I've been reading about that.
1211	1212	It's pretty bad.
1212	1214	- What is the lowdown on it? - Simple, honey.
1214	1217	Poor little dope lost his job, went berserk and shot a cop...
1217	1220	...who was coming to quiet him down. They'll hang him tomorrow.
1220	1221	What a shame.
1221	1223	Your paper has been taking his side.
1223	1227	If he was out of his mind, why doesn't the state just put him away?
1227	1230	Because it was a colored policeman. You know what that means.
1230	1232	The colored vote's important.
1232	1234	Especially with an election in three or four days.
1234	1237	That mayor would hang his grandmother to be reelected.
1237	1240	You could show the man wasn't responsible.
1240	1241	That's not so easy.
1242	1244	Maybe it isn't so hard either.
1244	1245	What do you mean, Hildy?
1246	1248	Doesn't an expert have to examine him before they hang him?
1248	1252	A bird named Egelhoffer is doing it. He'll say the same as the rest.
1252	1253	Suppose he does.
1253	1254	What's your scheme?
1254	1257	Walter, you get the interview with Earl Williams.
1257	1259	Print Egelhoffer's statement.
1259	1262	And right alongside it, double column, run your interview.
1263	1265	Alienist says he's sane. Interview shows he's goofy.
1265	1268	You could save that poor devil's life.
1268	1269	You could...
1270	1273	- You're going away. I forgot. - How long would the interview take?
1273	1276	An hour for the interview. An hour to write it.
1276	1279	We could take the 6 o'clock train if it'd save a man's life.
1280	1283	No, Bruce. If you want to save Earl Williams' life...
1283	1285	...write it yourself. You're a good reporter.
1285	1288	I can't write that kind of thing. It takes a woman's touch.
1289	1291	Don't get poetic. Get Sweeney.
1291	1293	He's the best man for that sob-sister stuff.
1293	1297	Poor Sweeney. Duffy just told me his wife finally had twins.
1297	1298	Isn't that terrible?
1298	1301	Sweeney went out to celebrate and now we can't find him.
1301	1304	So Sweeney has twins and Williams gets hanged.
1304	1305	Now, Walter, look.
1305	1309	Argue with her, or you'll be on a honeymoon with blood on your hands.
1309	1311	How can you be happy after that?
1311	1314	You'll remember that a man went to the gallows...
1314	1316	...because she was too selfish to wait two hours.
1316	1319	Earl Williams' face will come between you tonight...
1319	1321	...and the rest of your life.
1321	1324	Stop it, Walter. The whole place will hear you.
1324	1326	What an act.
1326	1330	I just remembered Sweeney was only married four months ago.
1334	1336	Hildy, you win. I'm licked.
1336	1339	Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?
1339	1342	No, indeed. The twins were Walter's, all his.
1342	1343	It was nothing.
1344	1345	Well, come on, let's forget it.
1345	1347	We'll start over again.
1347	1349	- I'll offer a business proposition. - Not interested.
1349	1350	You'll be interested.
1351	1353	Don't listen to him. I know him from way back.
1353	1357	Excuse me, will you? I'm talking to him. Now, look, Bruce...
1357	1360	...persuade her and you can write an insurance policy for me.
1361	1364	No, Mr. Burns. I wouldn't use my wife for business purposes.
1364	1365	Wait a minute, Bruce.
1366	1367	- How big a policy? - 25,000.
1368	1369	Fifty thousand.
1369	1370	What's the commission on a $100,000 policy?
1371	1373	- Around $1000, but Hildy... - And what's wrong with $1000?
1374	1375	- I couldn't... - We could use that money.
1375	1377	How long would it take to get him examined?
1377	1379	I could get a company doctor here in 20 minutes.
1379	1381	- Get him. Get him. - You keep out of this.
1382	1385	Suppose you have Mr. Burns examined over in his office...
1385	1388	...and see what they'll allow on that old carcass of his.
1388	1391	- I'm better than I ever was. - That's nothing to brag about.
1392	1395	I'll go back and change and after you get the check, phone me.
1396	1398	I'll be in the press room at the criminal courts building.
1398	1402	Oh, Walter? I think you better make that a certified check.
1402	1403	Think I'm a crook?
1403	1406	Yes. No certified check, no story. Get me?
1406	1407	It'll be certified. Want my fingerprints?
1407	1409	No, thanks. I've still got those.
1409	1411	Gus, how much do I owe you?
1412	1414	Thank you, dear.
1415	1417	- Oh, I'm sorry. - How much money have you got?
1417	1419	You know, everything we have, $500.
1419	1421	- Give me it. - I have to buy the tickets.
1421	1425	I'll buy the tickets. Believe me, he'll get you in a crap game.
1425	1426	Hildy, I don't gamble.
1426	1430	I know people that never did anything till they met Walter Burns.
1430	1433	But remember, it's everything we have.
1433	1434	I know.
1435	1438	- You got change of ten? - See what I mean, don't you, Bruce?
1438	1440	I just gave everything to Hildy. All I've got left...
1440	1442	- Come on, Hildy. - Not me. Sign it.
1443	1444	All right.
1446	1447	For the waiter.
1448	1450	Come on, Bruce. Really.
1454	1455	I'll open for a dime.
1455	1456	I'm in.
1456	1457	I'll stay.
1457	1459	Wilcox 3400.
1459	1460	- How many? - Two.
1461	1464	Take that, one of you birds. You ain't doing anything, Ernie.
1465	1468	What's the matter with you guys? Crippled or something?
1468	1470	I'll just bet 20 cents.
1470	1472	Press room. Wait a minute.
1472	1475	Hello, Sarge, McCue talking. Hold the line, will you? What?
1476	1479	I told you this is the press room of the criminal courts building.
1479	1480	Jake, new lead on the hanging.
1481	1484	This alienist from New York, Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.
1484	1488	He's interviewing Williams in about half an hour in the sheriff's office.
1488	1490	Must be the tenth alienist they've put on Williams.
1491	1493	If he wasn't crazy, he would be by the time...
1493	1496	...ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.
1496	1498	- Is this guy Egelhoffer any good? - You figure it out.
1498	1502	He's the guy they sent to Washington to interview the Brain Trust.
1502	1504	He said they were sane.
1504	1505	Here's the situation on the eve of the hanging.
1506	1510	I'll pick up a little fudge. This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
1510	1513	A double guard has been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings...
1513	1514	...railroad terminals, and elevated stations...
1515	1517	...to prepare for the expected general uprising...
1517	1519	...of radicals at the hour of execution.
1519	1521	The sheriff has put 200 more relatives on the payroll...
1522	1524	...to protect the city from the Red Army...
1524	1526	...which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.
1526	1528	Trouble is, when the real Red Menace shows up...
1528	1531	...the sheriff will still be crying wolf. What do you got?
1531	1533	- Is that good? - Sure looks good from here.
1534	1536	Hildy, when did you get back?
1536	1537	- How are you, Eddie? - Glad to see you.
1538	1539	- Glad to see you. - Where'd you get the hat?
1540	1542	- I paid 12 bucks for that hat. - Coming back to work?
1542	1545	It's a farewell appearance. I'm going into business for myself.
1545	1548	- What doing? - I'm getting married tomorrow.
1548	1551	Again? Are we invited to the wedding?
1551	1554	I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.
1554	1557	- How are you, Murphy? - What are you getting married for?
1557	1559	- None of your business. - Ain't fooling us, are you?
1559	1562	Fooling? Look what I've got in here.
1562	1564	Three tickets to Albany on the 6:00 train tonight.
1565	1566	Three?
1566	1570	For me and my beau and, hats off boys, his sweet darling ma.
1570	1572	- That's nice. - What kind of marriage is that?
1572	1575	I'm settling down. I'm through with the newspaper business.
1575	1579	Can you picture Hildy singing lullabies and hanging out didies?
1579	1581	- Swapping lies over the back fence? - Sour grapes.
1581	1583	She'll get tired beating rugs.
1583	1585	I'm not going to beat any rugs.
1586	1589	That's 3rd and Jefferson. Where the Central School is.
1589	1591	- No school this time of day. - What do you care for? You quit.
1591	1593	You said you were through.
1593	1596	I just thought it might be a good fire, that's all.
1596	1599	- What's that? - Practicing for the Williams party.
1600	1602	- You'll miss a nice hanging. - Not interested.
1602	1604	Tell them to pipe down.
1609	1613	Keep quiet down there! How do you expect us to get any work done?
1613	1615	Shut up!
1616	1618	Very little respect for the press around here.
1619	1620	Say, did anybody phone me?
1620	1621	Not that I know of.
1622	1624	Say, Hildy, does Walter know you're getting married?
1624	1626	- Just had lunch with him. - Does he know you're quitting?
1626	1629	- I told him. Any more questions? - Shall I deal you in?
1629	1632	I haven't got time. I have to do a yarn on Williams.
1632	1634	Did he know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
1635	1638	If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienist, the answer is yes.
1638	1640	- Who is he? What's he do? - He was a bookkeeper.
1640	1642	He starts at $20 a week. After 14 years...
1643	1645	...he works himself up to $17.50. - Got more gum?
1645	1648	McClosky Company goes out of business. Williams loses his job.
1649	1650	Can't get another.
1651	1652	I'm in.
1652	1656	So he hangs around the park listening to soapbox spellbinders...
1656	1658	...making speeches, and begins believing them.
1658	1659	And makes some of his own.
1659	1661	- Up a dime. - I'm in.
1663	1666	- Anything else, Doc? - No, that'll be all, Mr. Burns.
1666	1667	Everything okay?
1667	1669	Nothing to worry about.
1669	1670	Good, good.
1671	1672	How are you doing, Bruce?
1672	1673	Just one more thing.
1674	1677	- Good day, Mr. Burns. Mr. Baldwin. - Goodbye, Doc. Thanks very much.
1677	1679	Who's the beneficiary?
1679	1682	- Excuse me? - That is, in case of your death.
1683	1686	- Who do we pay the money to? - Why, Hildy, of course.
1686	1689	I don't know. That would make me feel pretty funny.
1689	1692	Now, why shouldn't I make Hildy my whatever-it-was?
1693	1694	I feel I should take care of her.
1694	1697	But you will take care of her, Bruce.
1697	1700	Say, if that doctor is right, I'm good for a long time yet.
1700	1703	Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor with me.
1704	1706	I was a bad husband to Hildy.
1706	1708	She could have claimed a lot of alimony.
1709	1710	But she wouldn't take any.
1710	1712	She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
1712	1715	- I'm independent too, you know. - I know you are.
1716	1718	But look, you just figure it this way.
1718	1722	I'm good for, we'll say at least 25 years yet.
1722	1726	By then, you'll have made enough so that money won't mean anything to you.
1726	1728	But suppose you haven't made good.
1728	1731	What about Hildy's old age? Think of Hildy.
1732	1733	I can see her now.
1733	1737	White-haired, lavender and old lace.
1737	1739	- Can't you see her, Bruce? - Yes, yes, I can.
1739	1742	She's old, isn't she?
1742	1747	Don't you think that Hildy's entitled to spend her remaining years...
1747	1750	...without worries of money? Of course you do, Bruce.
1750	1752	Of course, if you put it that way.
1753	1756	And remember, I love her too.
1756	1759	Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.
1759	1761	And the beauty of it is...
1761	1764	...she'll never have to know until I've passed on.
1765	1768	Maybe she'll think kindly of me...
1768	1770	...after I'm gone.
1781	1783	You make me feel like a heel, coming between you.
1784	1786	No, no, Bruce. You didn't come between us.
1786	1789	It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me...
1791	1792	...it'll never be. What do you want?
1792	1795	Can I see you a minute, please?
1796	1798	Excuse me, Bruce.
1799	1800	Did you get it, you get it?
1801	1802	Where is it? Come on.
1802	1806	- Certified? - Sure. But Walter, that's for $2,500.
1808	1810	Here we are certified and everything.
1810	1812	Certified.
1814	1817	I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed to think she hasn't trusted you.
1818	1819	But she'll know some day.
1819	1822	You promised to phone her as soon as you got the check.
1823	1824	Oh, yes, yes, of course.
1824	1827	Get me Hildy Johnson, press room, criminal courts building.
1828	1831	Sit down, Bruce. The operator will get her for you.
1832	1834	Excuse me, will you?
1835	1837	Yes, I'll wait, thank you.
1840	1842	Start hollering. Hildegarde.
1842	1844	Thank you.
1844	1845	Hildy Johnson speaking.
1849	1851	Take it easy, will you?
1853	1855	Did you get the check? Is it certified?
1855	1858	Certified and everything. I have it right in my pocket.
1859	1860	In your pocket. That's fine.
1861	1863	Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine. Where are you?
1863	1864	Mr. Burns' office.
1865	1866	Is he there?
1866	1870	Look, Bruce. I don't want you to carry that check in your pocket.
1871	1872	Well, because...
1872	1874	Yes, yes, I know all that. But...
1876	1878	There's an old newspaper superstition...
1878	1881	...that the first big check you get, you put in the lining of your hat.
1882	1885	In your hat. It brings good luck.
1885	1887	I've been a reporter for 20 years. I never heard that.
1887	1891	Neither did I. I know it sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.
1891	1892	Yes, yes, right now.
1892	1894	All right. Just a minute.
1904	1905	There, I've done it.
1905	1906	Anything else?
1907	1909	Oh, yes.
1909	1910	All right.
1913	1915	Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.
1915	1916	Everything all right?
1916	1918	Hildy said she'll get right to work.
1919	1920	- Fine. - I must be going now.
1920	1923	You don't want to forget this. It might rain, you know.
1923	1924	Thanks.
1924	1927	You mind if I don't show you out? I'm so busy in here.
1928	1929	Thanks for everything.
1929	1931	- What did you say? - Thanks for everything.
1931	1934	Nonsense. Don't thank me. I should thank you.
1934	1936	- So long. - So long.
1949	1950	Hello, Cooley.
1951	1953	What are you doing here?
1953	1955	I want an interview with Earl Williams.
1955	1956	- No more interviews. - Why not?
1956	1960	Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's coming over. Can't do it.
1960	1961	Say, is this your money?
1962	1963	- I don't think it is. - Twenty bucks?
1963	1965	- I guess it is. - That's what I thought.
1965	1966	Come on, I'm in a hurry.
1966	1968	Open up here.
1968	1970	- Now, Hildy, don't be... - I won't be long.
1975	1977	- Hello, Earl. - Hello.
1977	1980	My name's Johnson. Mind if I talk to you for a few minutes?
1980	1982	No, I haven't anything else to do.
1983	1984	I guess that's right.
1988	1992	So I couldn't plead insanity. I'm just as sane as anybody else.
1992	1993	You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
1993	1996	Of course not. It's against everything I stand for.
1996	1999	They know it was an accident. I'm not guilty.
1999	2001	It's just the world.
2003	2004	I see what you mean.
2005	2008	Sorry about the lipstick, Earl. Now, look, after you lost your job...
2009	2011	- ...what did you do? - I tried to find another job.
2012	2013	I mean, how did you spend your time?
2013	2017	I used to sit around in the park, anyplace. I don't smoke.
2018	2020	When you were in the park, did you hear any speeches?
2021	2023	You mean those fellows that talk too much?
2024	2025	I didn't pay any attention...
2026	2028	Did you hear anything they said?
2028	2029	Yes.
2029	2032	Is there anything in particular you remember?
2032	2034	- There was one fellow. - What did he talk about?
2034	2036	He talked about production for use.
2036	2038	Production for use?
2038	2041	Yes, he said everything should be made use of.
2041	2042	Makes sense, doesn't it?
2043	2045	Yes, I liked him. He was a good speaker.
2046	2048	When you found yourself with that gun in your hand...
2048	2051	...and that policeman coming at you, what did you think about?
2051	2053	I don't know exactly.
2053	2056	Could it have been "production for use"?
2056	2059	- I don't know. L... - What's a gun for, Earl?
2060	2061	A gun?
2061	2063	Why, to shoot, of course.
2064	2066	And maybe that's why you used it.
2066	2067	- Maybe. - It seems reasonable.
2068	2070	Yes, yes, it is.
2070	2072	I've never had a gun in my hand before.
2072	2074	And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?
2075	2076	- Maybe that's why... - Sure, it is.
2077	2081	That's what I thought of. "Production for use". It's simple, isn't it?
2081	2084	- Very simple. - There's nothing crazy about that.
2084	2087	- Nothing at all. - Write about that in your paper.
2087	2089	You bet I will. Who sent you the roses?
2089	2091	Miss Mollie Malloy. She's wonderful...
2091	2092	Is that her picture?
2093	2095	- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she? - Time's up, Hildy.
2096	2097	All right.
2098	2099	Guess that's all.
2099	2103	I liked talking to you. Goodbye, Miss Johnson.
2104	2105	Goodbye, Earl.
2106	2107	Good luck.
2110	2113	- Three landladies, boys. - Got well, didn't you?
2113	2115	I wonder what the Post will do without Hildy?
2115	2117	You suppose Walter Burns will ever let her go?
2117	2120	Remember when Fenton wanted to go to Hollywood?
2120	2122	- Had him thrown in jail for arson. - Forgery.
2122	2125	- Was that it? - Yeah, give me some change.
2125	2126	Hey, Mac.
2126	2128	Hey, Stairway Sam.
2128	2130	Would you mind turning on some lights?
2131	2132	It's so dark, you can't see anything.
2133	2134	Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?
2134	2136	I don't know. Bruce something.
2136	2138	- I give the marriage six months. - Why?
2139	2141	She won't be able to be away from the paper any longer.
2141	2143	Did you see her when that bell went off?
2143	2147	It must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit.
2147	2151	I had a publicity job offered to me last year. I should have taken it.
2151	2153	That's what I'd like, a job on the side.
2153	2157	A desk and a stenographer. I wouldn't mind a nice, big blonde.
2157	2158	With big brown eyes.
2158	2161	I'll bet you ten to one it don't last six months.
2161	2165	She's just like us, or we wouldn't be waiting for that guy to dance.
2165	2168	- Miss Mollie Malloy. - Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?
2168	2173	- I've been looking for you tramps. - Come to pay a call on Williams?
2173	2176	Nice roses you sent Earl. What do you want done with them tomorrow?
2177	2178	A lot of wise guys, ain't you?
2178	2180	You're breaking up the game. What do you want?
2180	2182	I came to...
2183	2185	I came to tell you what I think of you. All of you.
2185	2187	Keep your shirt on.
2187	2190	If you was worth breaking my nails on, I'd tear your face open.
2190	2193	What are you sore about? Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?
2194	2197	You crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough.
2197	2201	I never said I loved Earl, and was willing to marry him on the gallows.
2201	2202	You made that up.
2202	2205	And about my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him.
2206	2208	You've been around that cuckoo since they threw him in the death house.
2209	2212	- That's a lie. - Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.
2212	2215	I met Mr. Williams just once in my life.
2215	2217	When he was wandering in the rain without his hat and coat on...
2217	2220	...like a sick dog, the day before the shooting.
2220	2221	Give me one.
2221	2223	I went up to him like any human being would...
2223	2225	...and asked him what was the matter.
2225	2229	He told me about being fired after being on the job for 14 years.
2229	2231	- Who bets? - Bet 20 cents.
2231	2233	I brought him up to my room because it was warm.
2233	2235	Put it on a phonograph.
2235	2237	Listen to me, please.
2238	2242	I tell you he just sat there talking to me all night.
2242	2244	He never once laid a hand on me.
2244	2246	And in the morning he went away...
2247	2249	...and I never saw him again till that day of the trial.
2250	2252	- Sure, I was his witness. - And what a witness.
2252	2254	That's why you're persecuting me.
2254	2257	Because Earl treated me decent, and not like an animal.
2257	2260	- We're busy. - Go see your boyfriend.
2260	2262	- He's got a nice room. - Not for long.
2262	2264	He left a call for 7 a.m.
2264	2269	It's a wonder lightning don't come down and strike you all dead.
2279	2280	What's that?
2281	2284	They're fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend.
2284	2285	Shame on you.
2286	2287	Shame on you!
2288	2291	A poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm.
2292	2295	Sitting with the angel of death, and you cracking jokes.
2295	2296	You're going to get out of here.
2297	2299	- Take your hands off me! - Let's get out of here.
2299	2300	They ain't human.
2301	2303	- I know. They're newspapermen. - All they've been doing is lying.
2303	2305	All they're doing is writing lies.
2306	2307	Why won't they listen to me?
2308	2310	Why won't they listen to me?
2329	2330	Who?
2330	2331	Hildy Johnson?
2332	2334	Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.
2338	2340	You guys want to play any more cards?
2340	2343	What's the use? I can't win anyway.
2360	2361	Gentlemen of the press.
2364	2365	Hildy.
2365	2366	Phone for you.
2373	2374	What?
2374	2375	Where are you?
2376	2377	You're where?
2378	2379	Well, how did that happen?
2380	2382	Never mind, never mind. I'll be right down.
2384	2386	I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.
2387	2389	Hi, Sheriff. How you doing?
2389	2393	My shin and my back. What's going on around here?
2393	2396	- Bruce was in trouble. - Lioness rushes to defend cub.
2396	2398	Man forgets hankie. Mama goes to wipe nose.
2398	2400	I still give that marriage six months.
2400	2403	I don't know what you fellows are talking about.
2403	2404	What do you want, Pete?
2405	2408	Oh, I got the tickets for the hanging here, boys.
2408	2409	- Pete? - What?
2409	2413	Why can't you hang this guy at five o'clock instead of seven?
2413	2416	It won't hurt you, and we can make the city edition.
2416	2418	That's kind of raw, Roy...
2418	2420	...hanging a man in his sleep to please a newspaper.
2421	2424	But you can reprieve him twice so he hangs three days before election.
2424	2426	And you can run on a law-and-order ticket.
2426	2429	I had absolutely nothing to do with those reprieves.
2429	2431	How do we know there won't be another tonight?
2432	2434	What if Egelhoffer finds Williams insane?
2434	2438	He won't find him insane, because he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.
2438	2439	Saner!
2439	2442	Be serious, boys. After all, this is a hanging.
2442	2444	And it's going to go according to schedule.
2444	2447	Seven o'clock in the morning and not a minute earlier.
2447	2449	There's such a thing as being humane, you know.
2449	2451	All right, Pinky. Wait until you want a favor.
2452	2454	- And please don't call me Pinky. - Why not?
2454	2457	Because I got a name, see, and it's Peter B. Hartwell.
2457	2458	- What's the "B" for? - Bull.
2459	2463	But I'm innocent. I didn't do it. I never stole a watch in my life!
2463	2465	I know you didn't, Bruce. Mike, let him out.
2465	2468	I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch they found on him.
2469	2470	- But I never stole... - Please, Bruce.
2471	2472	Who accused him? Diamond Louie, a crook.
2473	2476	- I know. It's no good. - You going to let him out or not?
2476	2477	- I never stole... - Please.
2477	2480	All right, you're not. Read the Post in the morning.
2480	2483	I can't imagine who'd do a thing like that to me.
2483	2486	- I can't think of any enemies. - I'm sure you haven't any...
2486	2489	- Have you got the check? - Oh, yes, I have it right here.
2489	2492	That's a funny superstition you newspaper people have.
2492	2494	Yes, isn't it?
2494	2496	About being arrested, I thought...
2496	2499	...maybe Walter Burns might have something to do with it.
2499	2501	But then, of course, I realized he couldn't have.
2502	2504	- Why? - He's a very nice fellow.
2504	2506	Oh, yes, I found that out.
2506	2509	- What's the matter? - I've lost my wallet.
2509	2512	Yes? Well, Bruce, never mind. I have the money.
2512	2514	Better give me the check too.
2514	2516	And that picture of us in Bermuda.
2516	2519	Don't bother, Bruce. You'll find lots of things missing.
2522	2524	Wait here. I'm not taking any more chances.
2524	2527	I'll be down in three minutes. We'll take the next train.
2527	2528	Sorry.
2529	2531	"And so into this little tortured mind...
2532	2535	...came the idea that that gun had been produced for use.
2535	2536	And use it he did.
2537	2541	But the state has a production for use plan too. It has a gallows.
2541	2544	And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs, that gallows will be used...
2545	2548	...to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body.
2548	2550	And out of Mollie Malloy's life...
2550	2553	...will go the one kindly soul she ever knew".
2554	2556	That's as far as she got.
2556	2558	But can that girl write an interview?
2558	2560	She'll do till somebody else comes along.
2560	2562	It's not ethical, reading other people's stuff.
2562	2564	Where you get that ethics stuff?
2564	2566	You're the only one who'll swipe any of it.
2566	2570	I say anybody that can write like that won't give it up to sew socks...
2570	2572	...for a guy in the insurance business.
2572	2575	Now I give that marriage 3 months and I'm laying 3-1.
2575	2577	- Any takers? - I'll take that bet.
2577	2581	A girl can't leave the room without being discussed by old ladies.
2581	2584	Hello, Post? Get me Walter Burns, will you, please?
2584	2586	Don't get sore. We were only saying...
2586	2588	...a reporter like you wouldn't quit so easy.
2588	2592	This is Hildy Johnson. I can quit all right, without a single quiver.
2592	2595	I'll live like a human being, not like you chumps.
2595	2597	Is that you? I've got some news for you.
2598	2601	I got the interview, but I've got some more important news.
2601	2603	Better get a pencil and take it down.
2603	2605	All ready?
2605	2607	Now, get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee.
2608	2610	There won't be an interview or a story.
2610	2612	Your check leaves with me in 20 minutes.
2612	2615	I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you.
2615	2617	And if I ever lay my eyes on you again...
2617	2620	...I'll hammer on your monkey skull so it rings like a Chinese gong!
2620	2624	You don't know why I'm angry? Get Louie to tell you about his watch.
2624	2626	And there's just one other little thing.
2630	2632	Hear that? That's the story I just wrote.
2633	2635	I know we had a bargain. I said I'd write it.
2635	2638	I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up. It's all in little pieces now.
2639	2641	And I hope to do the same for you someday.
2641	2643	That's my farewell to the newspaper game.
2643	2645	I'll be a woman. Not a news machine.
2645	2649	I'll have babies, give them cod-liver oil and watch their teeth grow.
2649	2652	And if I ever see one of them look at a paper, I'll brain him.
2653	2654	Where's my hat?
2655	2658	- Mr. Burns? Yes, she's still here. - Give me that.
2660	2662	And another thing I want...
2663	2666	Where is my... There it is.
2666	2669	- Hello, Doctor. Sorry to be late. - Quite all right.
2669	2671	These boys from the newspapers take up my time.
2671	2674	They wanted me to hang Williams at their convenience.
2674	2676	- Oh, hello, Earl. - These newspapers.
2676	2678	- What they did to me in Chicago! - I believe it.
2678	2680	- Always after me for interviews. - Me too.
2680	2682	I did promise to make some sort of statement...
2683	2685	...when I finished here. You don't mind, do you?
2685	2688	It is hardly ethical. All statements are supposed to come from me.
2688	2691	I see. What do you say to giving them some sort of joint interview?
2692	2695	I can discuss some of the psychological aspects of the case and you...
2695	2696	We'd have our pictures taken together?
2697	2698	- Shaking hands. - Splendid idea!
2698	2700	I don't take a good picture.
2700	2702	That doesn't matter. Publicity's the thing.
2702	2705	Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.
2705	2707	Can't I go back to jail again?
2707	2709	I'm sorry. I forgot you were there.
2709	2711	No, we've further questions for you.
2711	2713	Sheriff, would you extinguish the lights?
2713	2717	That will help with what we're doing here. Now, let me see.
2719	2722	Mr. Williams, you know, of course, that you are going to be executed.
2723	2725	Who do you feel is responsible for that?
2725	2728	I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.
2728	2730	- Well, Murph. - Send a post card, kid.
2730	2732	- Goodbye. - Au revoir, Hildegarde.
2732	2733	When will we see you again?
2733	2735	Next time you see me, I'll be in a Rolls Royce...
2736	2737	...giving interviews on success.
2738	2739	So long, you wage slaves.
2740	2742	When you're climbing fire escapes, getting kicked out front doors...
2743	2744	...and eating in one-armed joints...
2745	2747	...don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson.
2747	2750	And when the road beyond unfolds, and the work...
2757	2758	Look out! It's a jailbreak!
2762	2764	What's the matter? What happened?
2765	2767	Watch where you're aiming, will you?
2768	2769	Watch the gate! He'll try the gate!
2770	2771	Who got away? Who was it?
2771	2772	- Earl Williams! - Who did he say?
2773	2774	Earl Williams!
2775	2778	Hello, hello! Hurry up, this is important.
2778	2780	- Flash! Earl Williams just escaped. - Jailbreak!
2781	2782	Williams went over the wall!
2782	2783	I don't know anything yet.
2789	2792	Hello, Post? Give me Walter Burns, quick. Hildy Johnson.
2794	2795	Walter? Walter? Hildy.
2795	2798	Earl Williams just escaped from the county jail.
2798	2800	Don't worry, I'm on the job.
2815	2817	Hey, Cooley!
2817	2818	Wait!
2822	2824	Hey, wait a minute!
2843	2845	Cooley, I want to talk to you!
2855	2857	This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.
2858	2859	He ain't here.
2859	2861	Hello, Gil? Here's the situation now.
2861	2864	Ready? Williams was taken to the sheriff's...
2864	2868	...to be examined by Egelhoffer. In a few minutes, he shot his way out.
2868	2872	Nobody knows where he got the gun. He got out through the skylight.
2872	2874	He must have slid down the rainpipe.
2874	2876	Nobody knows where he got it. Or they won't talk.
2876	2877	Give me the desk.
2877	2880	The crime commission offers a $10,000 reward.
2880	2883	No clue yet as to Williams' whereabouts.
2883	2885	Here's a little feature. An accident about a tear bomb.
2885	2888	Yeah, tear bomb, tear bomb. Criminals cry for it.
2888	2889	I don't know.
2889	2893	The tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of the bombing squad.
2893	2895	The following deputies were rushed to the hospital.
2895	2897	- A fine friend you are. - Their names are...
2897	2899	...Mervin D. Wilkerson, the mayor's brother-in-law.
2899	2901	After all I've done for you.
2901	2903	Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.
2903	2905	Highlights on Sheriff Hartwell's manhunt.
2906	2908	William Mansfield, his landlord, and Lester Winthrop...
2909	2910	...who married the sheriff's niece.
2910	2912	You remember, the very homely dame? Call you back.
2912	2915	Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady, while scrubbing the eigth floor...
2916	2918	...was shot by one of the sheriff's deputies.
2918	2919	Look, I'm not...
2920	2921	There goes another scrub lady!
2921	2924	It was only a flesh wound. They took her to the hospital.
2924	2927	- McCue speaking. Give me the desk. - Any dope on how he escaped?
2927	2929	Maybe the sheriff let him out so he could vote for him.
2929	2933	A man answering the description of Earl Williams boarded a southbound...
2933	2935	Call you back.
2935	2937	- I thought you'd gone. - I thought so too.
2938	2940	Get me Walter Burns, quick!
2943	2944	Walter, listen.
2945	2948	I've got the story on how Williams escaped, and I've got it exclusive.
2948	2951	That's right, and it's a pip.
2951	2953	It cost me $450 to tear it out of Cooley.
2953	2955	What's the story?
2955	2958	I'll give it to you. But first I have to tell you I gave him money.
2958	2960	And it wasn't exactly mine.
2960	2962	It's Bruce's money and I want it back.
2963	2964	Bruce's money?
2964	2967	Sure, you'll get it. Now, what's the story?
2967	2970	I'll send the money. I swear it on my mother's grave.
2970	2973	All right. Here's the... Wait a minute, your mother's alive!
2973	2976	My grandmother's grave. What's the story?
2976	2978	You get that money down here.
2978	2981	All right, here's your story. The jailbreak of your dreams.
2981	2984	This expert, Dr. Egelhoffer, the thinker from New York...
2984	2987	...was giving Williams a sanity test in the sheriff's office.
2987	2990	Sticking a lot of pins in him so he could get his reflexes.
2991	2994	He decided to reenact the crime as it had taken place...
2994	2996	...in order to study Williams' coordination.
2997	3000	I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun to reenact the crime with.
3000	3004	Who do you suppose supplied it? Peter B. Hartwell. "B" for brains.
3006	3008	No kidding!
3009	3011	I'm not kidding. I'm not good enough to make this up.
3011	3013	The sheriff gave his gun to the professor...
3013	3016	...who gave it to Earl, who shot the professor in the classified ads.
3016	3018	No, ads.
3018	3020	Ain't it perfect?
3020	3022	If he'd unrolled a red carpet and loaned Williams an umbrella...
3023	3024	...it couldn't have been more ideal.
3024	3027	Who? Oh, no. Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.
3027	3030	They took him to the hospital, where they're afraid he'll recover.
3030	3032	That's great work, Hildy.
3032	3034	Stop worrying about that money. You'll get it in 15 minutes.
3035	3039	I had better. Bruce is waiting in a taxi for me and we're in a hurry.
3039	3040	Hold on a minute.
3040	3042	Vangie, come here.
3042	3044	There's a guy in a taxi in front of criminal courts.
3044	3045	Name's Bruce Baldwin.
3046	3049	- What does he look like? - He looks like Ralph Bellamy.
3049	3051	- Oh, him? - Can you handle it?
3051	3053	I've never flopped on you yet, have I?
3053	3056	Come on, get going. You only got about two minutes. Hurry.
3056	3059	Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again?
3059	3062	$450. Well, just a second.
3062	3065	Louie, come here. I need $450 worth of counterfeit money.
3066	3069	- Can't carry that much, boss. - No, just the $450 counterfeit.
3069	3070	I got that on me.
3070	3072	Quite a coincidence. Take it over to Hildy.
3073	3074	It's coming. I'm sending it with Louie.
3075	3077	Thanks for your story. And good luck on your honeymoon.
3077	3081	No, no, never mind the thanks. Just see that money gets here.
3084	3087	- Hildy, you still here? - No, I'm in Niagara Falls.
3087	3088	McCue speaking.
3088	3091	Emil, I got a good feature on the manhunt.
3091	3095	Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, colored, gave birth to a pickaninny...
3095	3099	...in a patrol wagon with Hartwell's rifle squad acting as nurses.
3099	3101	Phoebe was walking along the street when...
3101	3103	That's right.
3103	3106	So they coaxed her into the patrol wagon.
3106	3108	When the pickanninny was born, they checked...
3108	3111	...to see if it was Earl Williams. They knew he was hiding somewhere.
3112	3116	Here's the payoff. They named the kid Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.
3116	3118	Press room.
3118	3120	Bruce? I thought you were downstairs in a...
3121	3122	What?
3122	3124	Arrested again. What for this time?
3124	3129	Well, they called it "mashing".
3129	3132	No, I didn't, Hildy!
3132	3134	I was sitting in the taxi where you left me...
3135	3139	...and the young lady seemed to have a dizzy spell and I just...
3142	3144	She's kind of...
3147	3149	Yes, she's a blonde.
3149	3150	Yes, very blonde.
3150	3153	Never mind. I know how it happened. Just a minute.
3153	3156	Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.
3156	3160	Bruce, where are you? Twenty-seventh Precinct? Hold on a minute.
3160	3162	Walter, you...
3162	3163	He was there a minute ago.
3164	3165	But I want...
3165	3168	"I'm sorry, I can't locate him". Why, that double-crossing...
3168	3172	Hello, not you. Bruce, I can't get there right away.
3172	3173	How about 20 minutes?
3173	3175	I have to wait here for the...
3175	3177	I'll tell you when I see you.
3177	3179	If I ever get my hands on Walter...
3179	3182	- Anything I can do to help? - How much money you got?
3182	3183	- $1.80. - 64 cents.
3184	3186	- Welcome to it. - Thanks, you better buy an annuity.
3187	3190	What's that, Emil? No, I can't give you an official statement.
3190	3193	No, wait a minute. Here's the mayor. How about a statement, Mayor?
3194	3197	- Don't pester me now, please. - His Honor won't say anything.
3197	3199	- Have you seen Hartwell? - Hard to tell.
3199	3201	There's so many cockroaches around...
3201	3203	Wait a minute. How about a statement?
3203	3207	- We go to press in 20 minutes. - I've nothing to say. Not now.
3207	3209	Just a moment. What do you know about the escape?
3210	3212	- Where'd he get the gun? - Not so fast.
3212	3214	- About the election... - What effect will this have?
3215	3216	None whatsoever.
3216	3219	How can an unavoidable misfortune like this...
3219	3222	...have any influence on the upright citizens of our fair city?
3223	3226	Mr. Mayor, please, is there a Red Menace or ain't there?
3226	3227	How did Williams get out?
3228	3230	Have you picked out somebody to be responsible?
3230	3233	Any truth in the report you're on Stalin's payroll?
3233	3236	The senator claims you sleep in red underwear.
3236	3238	Never mind the jokes. Don't forget I'm the mayor and...
3239	3240	Hartwell, I want to see you!
3240	3241	How'd he get away?
3242	3243	Where'd he get the gun?
3243	3246	Any statement on the Red Uprising tomorrow?
3246	3248	- Red Uprising? - There will be no Red Uprising.
3248	3251	The governor says the situation calls for the militia.
3251	3255	I say anything the governor says is a tissue of lies.
3255	3258	Here's a red-hot statement from the governor.
3258	3260	He claims the mayor and sheriff have shown themselves...
3261	3264	...to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire.
3265	3267	You can quote him as follows:
3267	3270	"It's lucky for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day...
3270	3273	...as the citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching...
3273	3276	...the mayor and the sheriff". That's all. Call you back.
3276	3278	Nice to have seen you, Mayor.
3278	3281	- Excuse me, I've got so much to do. - Wait. Who engineered this getaway?
3282	3283	- Was it the Reds? - Was it you?
3283	3286	Me? Just a minute. I'll tell you. I've got him located.
3286	3287	- Williams? - Where?
3287	3289	Out on Center Street. I just got a tip.
3289	3291	- Why didn't you say so? - The rifle squad is going out.
3292	3293	You'll catch him if you hurry.
3294	3295	- Look, please... - Pete, I want to talk to you.
3295	3297	I've got so much to do.
3297	3299	- See here, Fred... - Pete, you're through.
3299	3301	Through? You mean I'm through?
3301	3303	I'm scratching your name off the ticket...
3303	3305	...and running Sherman in your place.
3305	3308	"Reform the Red with a rope"! Williams isn't a Red and you know it!
3308	3311	But there's Communistic sympathizers and I thought...
3311	3313	...if I got a slogan like that I could...
3313	3316	That's got nothing to do with this case.
3316	3320	There are 200,000 votes at stake. If he don't hang, we'll lose them.
3320	3322	We're going to hang him. He can't get away.
3323	3325	What do you mean? He did get away, didn't he?
3325	3327	What do you want?
3327	3329	- What do you want? - Are you Sheriff Hartwell?
3329	3331	I'm him. What is it?
3331	3335	You're a hard man to find. I have a message from the governor.
3335	3337	- What? - It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.
3338	3339	- For who? - Earl Williams.
3339	3342	You said there wasn't going to be a reprieve.
3342	3345	It frightens me to think of what I'd like to do to you. Who was there?
3345	3348	- Nobody. He was fishing. - Get the governor on the phone.
3348	3350	He's not there. He's duck shooting.
3350	3353	Blasted nimrod! Fishing, duck shooting...
3353	3355	A guy who's done nothing for the last 40 years...
3356	3358	...gets elected governor and he's a Tarzan.
3358	3361	Read that. "Insane". He knows very well Williams isn't insane.
3361	3363	I never met the man.
3363	3366	- Pure politics. - It's an attempt to ruin us.
3366	3367	What do we tell the reporters?
3367	3370	Tell them the party is through on account of you.
3370	3373	As an afterthought, tell them I want your resignation now.
3373	3376	Hello. Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.
3376	3377	What? Where?
3378	3380	Holy Moses! Hold the wire!
3380	3381	They've got Williams!
3381	3383	The rifle squad has him at his house.
3383	3386	- Tell them to hold the phone. - Hold the wire.
3386	3389	- Cover up that transmitter. - No. Now, listen.
3389	3391	You never arrived with this.
3391	3393	Yes, I did. I came through that door...
3393	3395	- How much do you make? - I thought he was sheriff...
3395	3397	- What's your salary? - $40 a week.
3397	3401	How'd you like to make $350 a month? That's almost $100 a week.
3401	3403	I couldn't afford that. Who? Me?
3403	3406	They need a fellow like you in the city sealer's office.
3406	3407	- The what? - City sealer's.
3407	3409	You mean I should work in the sealer's...
3410	3414	My wife wouldn't like that. She lives in the country with my family.
3414	3418	That's all right. Bring her in. We'll pay all the expenses.
3418	3420	- I don't think so. - Why not?
3420	3424	I got two kids in school. If they change towns, they'll lose a grade...
3424	3425	No. They'll skip a grade.
3426	3428	And I guarantee you that they'll graduate...
3428	3430	Hold your horses, Olsen. Hurry up, Fred.
3430	3431	Now, what do you say?
3431	3433	That puts me in a peculiar hole.
3433	3436	No, it doesn't. You never delivered this.
3436	3438	You got caught in traffic or something.
3438	3440	- No, I came... - Pretend you didn't.
3440	3443	Now get out and don't let anybody see you.
3443	3445	- But how do I know... - Come to my office tomorrow.
3445	3447	- What's your name? - Pettibone.
3447	3448	- Pettibone? - Not really.
3449	3450	Lay low and keep your mouth shut.
3451	3453	- I'm tired anyhow. - Go to this address.
3453	3454	Nice homey place.
3454	3456	They'll take care of you. Tell them Fred sent you.
3457	3460	- Here's $50 on account. - Wait, I'll tell you in one minute.
3460	3462	You forgot to tell me what a city sealer does.
3463	3464	- Is it hard? - Easy. Very easy.
3464	3467	Good, because my health isn't what my wife...
3467	3468	- We'll fix that too. - My wife?
3468	3471	Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.
3471	3472	They're still on the phone.
3472	3476	- Tell them to shoot to kill. - But the reprieve!
3476	3479	- Go ahead and do as I tell you. - Hello, Olsen.
3479	3481	Shoot to kill. That's the orders. Pass the word along.
3482	3484	- $500 reward. - $500 for the man who does it.
3484	3486	I'll be right over.
3488	3489	Hi, Hildy.
3490	3492	You double-crossing hyena.
3492	3494	What'd you pull on Mr. Baldwin this time?
3494	3496	- Who, me? - You and that albino of yours.
3496	3499	- Evangeline's no albino. - She'll do, till one comes along.
3499	3501	She was born in this country.
3501	3505	If she tries anything else, she'll have to stay in this country.
3505	3508	- Did you bring that money? - Oh, yeah, $400.
3508	3510	$450.
3510	3513	All right, you can't blame a guy for trying.
3514	3515	- Give me a receipt. - I'll give you a scar.
3515	3517	You got plenty of them.
3517	3519	I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.
3519	3521	- Mr. Baldwin's what? - His purse. Come on, Louie.
3522	3525	All right, Hildy. I'll do it for you because I like you.
3525	3528	But tell your financier to be more careful, know what I mean?
3528	3531	I'll loan him a pair of your brass knuckles.
3531	3533	Don't talk that way. I'll take that.
3533	3535	- I'll take it to the station. - Wait a minute!
3535	3538	Take it to the 27th Precinct and tell the cops how this happened.
3539	3541	I couldn't do that. Burns would turn me in.
3541	3543	- Not a bad idea. - Here, catch!
3543	3544	Louie!
3553	3556	Hello, operator. Hildy Johnson. Will you get me...
3556	3558	Drop that phone!
3558	3559	Never mind.
3560	3562	You won't tell anybody where I am.
3566	3568	Put that gun down, Earl.
3570	3573	You don't want to shoot me. I'm your friend, remember?
3573	3576	I'm writing the story on you of production for use.
3576	3580	- That's right. Production for use. - You don't want to hurt your...
3580	3582	Don't move! Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.
3583	3584	But don't come nearer.
3584	3587	You can't trust anybody in this crazy world.
3587	3590	I don't blame you. I wouldn't trust anybody either.
3590	3593	Don't do that. Put it back. Put it back.
3593	3597	If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you. I can do it right from here.
3598	3601	Sure you could, Earl. But you don't want to do that.
3601	3603	You don't want to kill anybody.
3603	3606	No, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody.
3606	3609	- That's what I thought. - Wait a minute. Where are you going?
3610	3612	I was going to close the door so nobody'd see you.
3612	3614	No, you weren't. You were going to get somebody.
3614	3616	But I don't want that. All I want is to be left alone.
3617	3618	- I won't get anybody. - You will.
3618	3622	You'll get them after me again. I won't let you do that. I won't...
3624	3627	- Give me that. - I guess I fired all the shells.
3627	3631	- I'm awful tired. - That shot. They'll know you're here.
3631	3632	I don't care.
3632	3636	I'm not afraid to die. I told the guy that when he handed me the gun.
3636	3639	- Quiet! - Waking me in the middle of the night.
3639	3641	Talking about things they don't understand.
3641	3642	Shut up.
3642	3644	I wish they'd take me back and hang me.
3645	3646	They will if you don't keep quiet.
3646	3648	I couldn't go through another day like this.
3649	3650	You think I could?
3651	3654	Get me Walter Burns, quick. Tell him I need him.
3657	3660	Bruce, I know I said I'd be down, but something terrific has happened.
3661	3662	Walter, come right away.
3662	3664	Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.
3664	3666	I've got Earl Williams here, in the press room.
3666	3668	On the level. Hurry, I need you!
3668	3671	Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams. You know, the murderer.
3671	3674	Stay there, Earl. Wait. Bruce, I'll be down.
3674	3676	As soon as I hand him to the paper.
3676	3678	Bruce, I can't. Don't you realize...
3680	3683	- Who is it? - Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!
3684	3687	- What do you want, Mollie? - I got to find...
3687	3689	- Where is everybody? - They've gone.
3689	3690	Please tell me where.
3690	3692	I don't know, and I'm awfully busy.
3692	3695	They got him surrounded. They'll shoot him down like a dog.
3695	3697	They're looking for you too.
3697	3699	I don't care. Tell me. I ain't afraid of them.
3700	3702	All right, they're down at Center Street and Fourth.
3703	3706	- Oh, that's where I used to... - Mollie, Mollie, don't go.
3706	3708	Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.
3711	3713	- Hello. - How did you get in here?
3713	3717	Down the pipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. Really, I didn't.
3718	3720	- Be quiet. - You believe me, don't you?
3720	3721	Sure, I believe you.
3721	3724	Thanks for the roses. They were beautiful.
3724	3727	That's all right, Mr. Williams.
3728	3731	- Don't cry. - Don't you get hysterical.
3731	3732	I want to get him out.
3732	3735	- You wouldn't get down that hall. - But they'll find him.
3735	3738	I know. I'm trying to think before those reporters come back.
3739	3740	Let them take me. What's the difference?
3741	3742	I'll never let them.
3743	3745	Who locked the door?
3746	3748	- Now it's too late. - It isn't. Get in this desk.
3748	3751	- Oh, what's the use? - Come on, get in.
3754	3756	We'll get you out in ten minutes.
3757	3760	Pull yourself together. All right, here. Sit down.
3761	3764	All right, all right, I'm coming!
3766	3769	- Don't kick the building down. - We got phone calls to make.
3769	3771	What's she doing up here?
3771	3773	What's the matter?
3773	3775	Came up here and had hysterics.
3775	3777	- How do you feel, kid? - Not so good.
3777	3778	Get you some water?
3778	3781	- Do anything for you? - You don't look so sick.
3781	3783	- Did you bump into Williams? - Funny!
3783	3785	- Where is he? - Let me alone.
3785	3788	- Okay. Give me the desk. - No harm in asking.
3788	3792	Hello, Jim. Yes, false alarm. They surrounded the house, all right...
3792	3793	...but Williams wasn't there.
3794	3796	The Halloween outside has the police standing on its ear.
3796	3799	- I thought you were gone. - I'm waiting for money from Walter.
3799	3801	What a chase! Give me Emil.
3801	3803	- Give me the desk. - Any news, boys?
3804	3806	Yeah, I never been so tired in my life.
3806	3807	What? Where? Melrose Station?
3808	3810	All right, connect me. Hello, Mollie. How are you?
3810	3812	Hold it a minute. This looks good.
3812	3815	An old lady claims Williams is hiding under her piazza.
3815	3817	Tell her to stand up.
3817	3820	- You want to go out on it? - I'll cover this end.
3820	3823	- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already. - No more going out.
3824	3826	- Never mind, Sarge. - Who pulled the shades down?
3826	3828	They were throwing those lights around.
3835	3837	You know, I've got a hunch Williams...
3837	3839	...ain't anywhere they've been looking for him.
3839	3841	He might be here in this building.
3841	3844	Sure, sure, hanging around like a duck in a shooting gallery.
3845	3847	From the skylight, but how did he reach the ground?
3847	3851	- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl. - He could have jumped to this roof.
3851	3854	From the roof he could slide down the drainpipe.
3854	3856	And come in any of these windows.
3856	3858	If the story walks in the window...
3858	3861	Masterminds. Why don't you go home? Maybe Williams will call on you.
3862	3864	It'd be funny if he was in this building.
3864	3866	Why not search the building?
3866	3869	- I am not wandering all over. - A great bunch of reporters you are.
3869	3871	Too lazy to go after the biggest story in years.
3872	3874	You seem pretty anxious to get rid of us.
3874	3877	- Are you trying to scoop us? - Are you crazy? On my time?
3877	3881	Maybe Mollie's been giving her the truth on how Williams got the gun.
3881	3882	I didn't do nothing.
3883	3885	- Come clean. - Let the girl alone. She's...
3885	3886	Well?
3886	3888	Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.
3888	3892	Don't "mother" me. Playing cat and mouse and keeping my boy locked up.
3892	3895	Making us miss two trains, and you supposed to be married tomorrow.
3895	3899	- I'll be with you in five minutes... - Just give me Bruce's money.
3899	3902	You can stay here forever, you and that murderer you caught.
3902	3905	- Murderer? - Which one of these men is it?
3905	3908	- They all look like murderers. - What murderer did you catch?
3908	3910	I never said any such thing.
3910	3912	I'm quoting my son. He has never lied to me.
3913	3914	Somebody's lying.
3914	3916	- I never said anything like that. - Yes, you did.
3916	3919	I said I was trying to find the murderer.
3919	3921	- Quit stalling. - She's got it balled up.
3921	3923	Who are you holding out on?
3923	3925	Nobody. Now let me go, will you?
3925	3927	Stop it, stop it!
3927	3931	She don't know where he is. I'm the only one that knows.
3931	3933	- Where's Williams? - Try and find out.
3933	3936	- Come on, talk. - Now you want me to talk?
3936	3937	- Talk. - Ain't that funny?
3938	3941	You wouldn't listen to me before, and now you want me to talk.
3941	3942	Don't say anything.
3942	3944	- I know what I'm doing. - Stay out of this.
3944	3947	- Why didn't you listen to me? - Cut that out.
3947	3948	- Hands off! - Where is he?
3949	3952	Why do you want to know? So you can write more lies to sell papers?
3952	3956	- Never mind that. - All right. I'll give you a story.
3956	3957	A wonderful story!
3958	3961	Only this time it'll be true. You'll never find me now!
3962	3964	Get the ambulance, somebody!
3964	3965	Get an ambulance, somebody!
3969	3972	- She's dead. - No, she isn't killed, she's moving!
3977	3980	- Did you see that? She jumped. - I know that.
3980	3981	Where have you got Williams?
3982	3984	Hidden. He's in the desk.
3984	3985	She didn't kill herself.
3985	3987	- How're you doing? - Let me out.
3987	3989	Quiet. You're sitting pretty.
3989	3991	- What's in there? - Who are you?
3991	3993	- This is Bruce's mother. - What are you doing?
3993	3995	- Shut up! - You're doing something wrong.
3995	3997	- Mother, please. - Take her out of here.
3998	4002	- Take the lady to Polack Mike's. - My name's Louie Peluso.
4003	4005	See that she doesn't talk to anyone.
4006	4007	Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.
4008	4009	Don't worry, Mother. It's only temporary.
4010	4012	Let go of me.
4012	4015	- Where are you going? - To get Bruce out of jail.
4015	4019	- Why did you do this to me? - Get Bruce out of jail?
4019	4022	How can you worry about a man who's resting in a police station?
4023	4026	- This is war! You can't desert me. - Get off that trapeze.
4026	4027	You've got your story.
4028	4030	"Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post".
4030	4033	I covered your story for you, now I'm getting out.
4033	4038	You drooling idiot, there are 365 days in a year one can get married.
4038	4041	How many times you got a murderer locked up in a desk?
4041	4044	You got the whole city by the seat of the pants.
4044	4046	You've got the brain of a pancake.
4046	4049	This isn't just a story. It's a revolution.
4049	4052	The greatest yarn since Livingston discovered Stanley.
4052	4055	- The other way around. - Don't get technical at such a time.
4056	4059	You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for 40 years...
4059	4062	...and given us a chance to have the same kind of government...
4062	4064	...New York has under La Guardia.
4064	4068	If I didn't have your best interest at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.
4068	4072	You've done something big. You've stepped up into a new class.
4072	4076	We'll make such monkeys of those ward healers nobody'll vote for them.
4076	4078	- Expose them? - We'll crucify that mob.
4078	4081	We'll keep Williams under cover, until we can break the story...
4081	4083	...then share the glory with the governor.
4084	4086	- I get it, I get it. - You'll kick over City Hall.
4086	4090	You got the mayor and Hartwell backed up against the wall.
4090	4093	This isn't just a newspaper story. It's a career!
4094	4097	And you bellyache about catching the eight or nine o'clock train.
4097	4101	- But I never figured it that way. - Because you're a doll-faced hick.
4101	4104	They'll be naming streets after you. There'll be statues of you.
4105	4108	The movies will be after you. There'll be a Hildy Johnson cigar.
4108	4111	I can see the billboards now: "Light up with Hildy Johnson..."
4111	4113	- We got a lot to do. - Now you're talking.
4113	4117	- We can't leave Williams here. - We'll take him to my private office.
4118	4121	- How are you going to take him? - We'll carry the desk over.
4121	4123	It's crawling with cops outside.
4123	4125	We'll lower it out the window with pulleys.
4125	4127	Start pounding out a lead!
4127	4131	- How much of this stuff do you want? - All you the words you got.
4131	4135	- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey? - Call him anything you like.
4135	4139	Give him the works. Hello, Duffy? We got the biggest story in years.
4139	4142	"Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post. Exclusive!"
4143	4144	Tear out the whole front page.
4145	4148	The whole front page. Out! And never mind the European war.
4148	4152	We got something bigger than that. Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.
4152	4154	And get hold of Butch O'Connor.
4154	4156	Tell him to come up here with his wrestlers.
4156	4157	Yeah, Butch O'Connor.
4158	4159	What? I've got a desk I want moved...
4160	4161	What the deuce do you want?
4161	4162	- Hello, Bruce. - Hildy.
4163	4165	Never mind the Chinese earthquake.
4165	4168	- I just want to ask you... - How'd you get out of jail?
4168	4170	Not through any help of yours.
4170	4171	I'm not talking to you.
4171	4175	I had to wire Albany for $100 so I could get out on bail.
4176	4179	What will they think in Albany? The money went to the police station.
4179	4183	- We're waiting for that story. - We'll explain everything to them.
4183	4185	- Where's mother? - She left.
4185	4186	I can't hear you.
4186	4188	- Where'd she go? - Out someplace.
4188	4191	- Junk the Polish Corridor! - Tell me where my mother was going.
4191	4193	- She couldn't say. - This is more important.
4194	4196	- Did she get the money? - She left in a hurry.
4196	4198	- I'll take that money. - In my purse.
4198	4201	I can handle things. I'll take that certified check too.
4201	4205	I'll give you the tickets. You'll find your money in the wallet.
4205	4207	My wallet? This is my wallet.
4207	4210	Say, there's something funny going on... What are you doing?
4211	4212	Just wanted to look at it.
4213	4214	Hildy, I'm taking...
4215	4218	- I'm taking the 9 o'clock train. - Sure, sure.
4218	4221	Did you hear what I said? I said I am taking the 9 o'clock...
4222	4223	Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!
4225	4227	Let her alone, will you, buddy.
4228	4230	- Do me a favor... - Just answer one question.
4230	4232	You don't want to come with me, do you?
4232	4234	Answer me. You don't, do you?
4234	4237	No. Take the Miss America pictures off page six.
4237	4239	Hildy, tell me. Tell me the truth.
4239	4242	Wait a minute. Now look here, my good man...
4242	4244	You shut up, Burns.
4244	4245	You're doing all this to her.
4246	4248	She wanted to get away from you.
4248	4250	But you caught her and changed her mind...
4250	4253	Stick Hitler on the funny page. Now let me ask you...
4253	4255	Will you give up everything for a man like him?
4256	4258	No, but something's happened. I'll tell you...
4258	4260	Tell him nothing. He's a spy, you fool.
4261	4262	- I am not a spy. - Ridiculous.
4262	4264	You're coming with me right now.
4264	4267	Just a second. This is the biggest thing in my life.
4267	4270	I see. I'll keep. I'm like something in the icebox.
4270	4271	You just don't love me.
4272	4275	That isn't true. Just because you won't listen you say I don't love you.
4276	4278	You never intended to be decent and live like a human being.
4279	4281	All right, if that's what you want to think.
4282	4283	I'm trying to concentrate.
4283	4287	- You're just like him and all the rest. - Sure. That's what I am.
4287	4290	What? Leave the rooster story alone. That's human interest.
4291	4293	If you had any sympathy or understanding...
4293	4295	- I understand, all right... - Wait a minute.
4295	4299	There's one question I want to know. The mayor's first wife's name.
4299	4302	The one with the wart on her? Fanny. What, Duffy?
4302	4304	You never loved me at all.
4304	4306	Never mind. You don't work for advertising.
4306	4309	If you change your mind, I'm on the 9 o'clock train.
4309	4312	If you want me, take me as I am. Don't try to change me.
4312	4315	I'm no suburban bridge player. I'm a newspaperman.
4315	4318	That's it. Keep it coming as fast as you can.
4318	4320	Get back in there, you mock turtle.
4322	4325	You tell Butch it's a matter of life and death?
4325	4328	Good. Butch's on his way. We just have to hold out for 15 minutes.
4329	4332	- The boys will be back to phone. - I'll handle them.
4333	4336	God, now the moon's out.
4340	4343	Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget. Got enough air?
4343	4346	- Not very much. - That better? You're sitting pretty.
4347	4349	- How's it coming? - All right. Where's Bruce?
4349	4351	- He went out. - Is he coming back here?
4351	4354	Certainly. Didn't you hear him? What have you got so far?
4354	4358	"While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked the city, shooting bystanders...
4358	4360	...spreading terror, Williams was lurking..."
4360	4363	Wait a minute. Aren't you going to mention the Post?
4363	4366	- I did. Second paragraph. - Who reads the second paragraph?
4366	4369	How long have I been telling you how to write a story?
4369	4370	I'm sorry.
4374	4376	What's the idea of locking this door?
4376	4378	- Who's that? - Bensinger. That's his desk.
4378	4381	Open the door, will you?
4381	4383	- What's his name? - Bensinger, of the Tribune.
4383	4385	- The Tribune? - Who's in there?
4387	4388	Haven't you any better sense...?
4389	4392	Hello. Hello, Mr. Burns. Quite an honor having you come over here.
4393	4397	- Hello, Bensinger. - You know my... I just want to get my...
4397	4400	It's quite a coincidence seeing you tonight, isn't it?
4400	4401	How do you mean?
4401	4404	I was talking to our Mr. Duffy about you this afternoon.
4404	4406	Really? Nothing detrimental, I hope.
4406	4408	On the contrary. On the contrary.
4409	4411	That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
4412	4414	Did you care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
4414	4416	The poem? The poem was great.
4416	4417	I liked the ending especially.
4418	4419	"And all is well outside his cell...
4420	4422	...but in his heart he hears the hangman calling...
4422	4423	...the gallows falling...
4423	4426	...and his white-haired mother's tears".
4426	4428	- Heartbreaking? - That's fine.
4428	4429	Would you like to work for me?
4429	4431	We can use a man like you.
4431	4433	All we got are lowbrows like Johnson here.
4433	4436	- Are you serious, Mr. Burns? - Serious? Wait a minute.
4436	4439	Duffy, I'm sending Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.
4439	4441	- Bensinger. - Mervyn, isn't it?
4441	4443	- Yeah... No. Roy. Roy V. - Certainly.
4444	4446	Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.
4446	4450	You wouldn't know. You probably never heard of Shakespeare either.
4451	4455	Put Mr. Bensinger on staff. How much you getting on the Tribune?
4455	4457	- $75. - I'll give you $100 and a byline.
4457	4460	Now you give him everything he wants, you understand?
4460	4464	Roy, write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.
4464	4467	He hides, afraid of every sound, every light.
4467	4469	He hears footsteps, they're closing in.
4470	4473	- Get the sense of the animal at bay. - Sort of Jack London style?
4473	4477	- I'll get my rhyming dictionary. - It doesn't have to rhyme.
4477	4479	I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.
4481	4483	If there's an opening for a war correspondent...
4483	4485	...I parler a little French.
4485	4487	- I'll keep you in mind. - Au revoir, mon capitain.
4487	4489	Bonjour.
4492	4495	"His white-haired mother's tears". That's the tops.
4495	4498	Listen, that fellow Bensinger is on his way right now.
4498	4501	Handle him with kid gloves. Have him write poetry.
4501	4503	We don't want him. Stall him until the extra's out.
4503	4505	Say his poetry smells and kick him downstairs.
4506	4508	- Double-crosser. - That'll teach him.
4508	4510	He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
4510	4511	- I mean you. - Me?
4511	4514	You'd double-cross anybody... Wait a minute.
4514	4517	Bruce isn't coming back. He said he was taking the 9:00 train.
4517	4519	In that case, he's gone by now.
4519	4522	Don't sit there like a frozen robin. Get on with the story.
4522	4524	We ought to be finished when Butch gets here.
4524	4528	How you have messed up my life. What am I going to do?
4528	4531	Window's too small. We'll carry the desk out.
4531	4534	I'd be on that train right now. I'm a sap, falling for your line.
4534	4538	- They'll name streets after me... - Yes, well, get back to work.
4538	4540	I'm not going back to work. Walter, what...?
4541	4543	- Who is it? - It's me, boss. It's Louie.
4544	4545	Louie.
4546	4548	- What's the matter? - Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
4549	4550	What happened?
4550	4554	Down Western Avenue, we was going 65 miles an hour, know what I mean?
4554	4556	Where's the old lady?
4556	4558	We run smack into a police patrol. Busted it in half.
4559	4560	Was she hurt?
4560	4563	Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?
4563	4566	- What did you do with her? - Search me, when I come to...
4566	4568	You were with her. You were in the cab.
4569	4571	- The driver got knocked cold. - Butterfingers!
4572	4575	- You handed her over to the cops. - What do you mean?
4575	4577	They was on the wrong side of the street.
4577	4579	Fine. Now she's probably squawking to the police.
4580	4582	She's not squawking much. Know what I mean?
4582	4584	Don't tell me... Was she killed?
4584	4585	Was she? Did you notice?
4585	4588	Me with a gun on the hip and a kidnapped lady on my hands...
4588	4590	...I'm going to ask questions from cops?
4591	4594	- You know what I mean? - Dead, dead. This is the end!
4595	4596	It's fate.
4596	4597	What will be will be.
4597	4599	What am I going to say to Bruce?
4599	4600	What can I tell him?
4601	4603	If he loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.
4603	4606	Would you rather have had the old dame drag the police in here?
4607	4609	I killed her. I'm responsible.
4609	4611	What am I going to do? How can I ever face Bruce again?
4611	4614	- Look at me, Hildy. - I am looking at you, you murderer.
4614	4617	If it was my own grandmother, I'd carry on.
4617	4620	- You know I would, for the paper. - Louie, where'd it happen?
4620	4622	Western and 34th.
4622	4625	- I got to get out of here... - We can do more here. Be calm.
4625	4626	Listen...
4628	4631	- Hello, hello. - Maine 4557.
4631	4633	Who? Butch, where are you?
4633	4635	Mission Hospital? Receiving room.
4635	4637	What are you doing there?
4637	4639	Was an old lady brought in from a smashup?
4639	4642	For H. Sebastian, Butch, it's a matter of life and death.
4643	4644	- Nobody? - I can't hear.
4645	4648	- Morningside 2469. - You got who? Speak up. A what?
4648	4651	You can't stop for a dame now!
4651	4654	I don't care if you've been after her. Our lives are at stake!
4655	4657	Are you going to let a woman come between us?
4657	4660	Was there an old lady brought in in an auto smashup?
4660	4662	Butch, I'd put my arm in fire for you up to here.
4663	4664	You can't double-cross me.
4664	4665	Look around, please.
4666	4668	All right, put her on. I'll talk to her.
4668	4671	Good evening, madam. Now, listen, you ten-cent glamour girl...
4672	4674	...you can't keep Butch from his duty. What's that?
4674	4677	You say that again, I'll kick you in the teeth!
4677	4679	Say, what kind of language is that?
4679	4681	Now, look here, you...
4682	4684	She hung up. What did I say?
4685	4688	Duffy, how do you like that? Mousing around with some big...
4688	4692	- Will you shut up? I'm trying to hear! - Duffy! That's cooperation.
4693	4695	Well, where is Duffy?
4696	4699	Diabetes. I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.
4699	4701	Give me Olympia 2136, will you?
4702	4703	- Yes, boss. - Louie, it's up to you.
4704	4706	- Anything you say, boss. - Get a hold of some guys.
4706	4710	Anybody with hair on his chest, get them off the street.
4710	4711	We got to get that desk out.
4712	4714	Is it important? You're the best friend I got.
4714	4716	- I like you too. - Then don't fail me.
4716	4718	Get enough people to move that desk.
4718	4720	You know me. Shirt off my back.
4720	4722	Okay, don't bump into anything.
4723	4726	- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me. - Try the hospital again.
4727	4729	If he's not back in five, we'll carry it alone.
4729	4731	- Do anything you want. - There's a million ways.
4731	4734	- We can have firemen take it out. - I don't care what you do.
4734	4738	- Come here. See if we can lift it. - What? Nobody? Never mind.
4738	4739	- Are you going to help me? - No!
4740	4742	- I'll strain my back. - I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.
4742	4744	- Don't open that door! - I'll go to the morgue...
4744	4748	- We want to talk to you a minute. - Let go. What's the idea?
4748	4749	Get your hands off me!
4750	4751	- Now look here, Johnson... - Hey, you!
4752	4753	You mean me?
4753	4757	Yes, you. What do you mean by breaking in here like this?
4757	4760	Don't bluff me. I don't care what paper you're editor of.
4760	4763	Let go of me. Something's happened to my mother-in-law.
4763	4768	- We know what you are up to. - She and Mollie were in here talking.
4768	4770	I don't know anything. And there's been an accident.
4771	4773	There's something very peculiar going on here.
4773	4775	- Now see here... - Just a moment, Hartwell.
4776	4778	Make your accusations in the proper manner.
4779	4781	Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
4781	4782	Ask me to what?
4782	4784	Get out.
4784	4788	You will, eh? Don't let anybody in or out. We'll see about this.
4788	4791	- Give him the third degree. - Make them talk and you got Williams.
4791	4794	I'm going to get to the bottom of this. Are you going to talk?
4795	4797	- What do you want me to say? - What do you know about Williams?
4798	4799	There. Now we're getting some...
4800	4802	Take her away. I got ways to make her talk.
4802	4804	Don't you dare touch me or...
4804	4806	- She got a gun! - Grab it!
4806	4807	No, you don't. Walter!
4808	4810	All right, Burns. I'll take that gun.
4812	4814	- Where did you get this? - I can carry a gun.
4814	4816	- Not this gun. - I can explain it.
4816	4820	She was interviewing Williams, so I gave her a gun to defend herself.
4820	4824	Interesting. But this is the gun that Williams shot his way out with.
4824	4827	My good man, are you trying to make me out a liar?
4827	4829	I ought to know my own gun, oughtn't I...?
4830	4832	- So that's where Williams got it. - She got it from him.
4832	4833	Where's Williams?
4833	4835	- Where is he? - You're barking up the wrong tree.
4835	4837	Tell me where he is.
4837	4840	At the hospital calling on Professor Egelhoffer...
4840	4841	...with marshmallows.
4841	4844	- Where is he? - Ask the mastermind why he's here.
4844	4846	What do you know about this?
4846	4848	My dear fellow...
4848	4851	...the Morning Post doesn't obstruct justice or hide criminals.
4851	4853	- You ought to know that. - You're under arrest.
4854	4855	- You too. - Who's under arrest?
4856	4858	Listen, you square-toed, pimple-headed spy...
4858	4860	...do you realize what you're doing?
4860	4861	I'll show you.
4862	4864	You and the Post are obstructing justice.
4864	4866	I'll see that you're fined $10,000.
4866	4867	You'll see nothing.
4867	4870	I'll begin by impounding the Post's property.
4870	4871	Is this your desk?
4871	4874	What are you afraid of, Hildy? I dare you to move this desk.
4874	4876	- Go ahead, try it. - I will.
4876	4879	I warn you, you move this desk out of here, I'll put you behind bars.
4880	4882	- He can do it too. - I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.
4882	4884	Tell him. Come on, boys!
4884	4886	- Confiscate this desk. - This is your last chance.
4886	4888	This is a federal offense.
4888	4890	We'll take a chance.
4890	4891	All right.
4892	4894	Open up this door!
4895	4898	- Mother! I'm glad to see you... - That's the man that did it. There.
4902	4905	- What's the idea here? - She claims she's been kidnapped.
4905	4908	They dragged me down all the way down the stairs and...
4908	4909	Did he do it?
4910	4912	He was in charge. He told them to kidnap me.
4913	4915	Excuse me, madam. Are you referring to me?
4915	4916	You know you did.
4917	4919	What about this? Kidnapping, huh?
4919	4922	Trying to frame me, huh? I never saw her before in my life.
4922	4924	What a thing to say!
4924	4926	I was here when that girl jumped out the window.
4926	4928	Get the mayor over here.
4928	4930	Look, madam, be honest. If you were out joyriding...
4931	4934	...plastered, or got into a scrape, why don't you admit it instead of...
4934	4935	...accusing innocent people?
4936	4938	You ruffian! How dare you talk like that to me!
4938	4940	He's just crazy, Mother.
4940	4943	I'll tell more. I could tell you why they did it.
4943	4945	They were hiding some kind of murderer in here...
4946	4947	Hiding him? In here?
4947	4950	Madam, you're a cockeyed liar...
4950	4952	...and you know it!
4953	4954	- What's that? - He's in there!
4955	4956	- Give me the desk. - What a break!
4956	4958	- Stand back. - He might shoot.
4958	4959	- Guns out. - He's harmless.
4959	4961	Don't take any chances.
4961	4963	He can't hurt anybody, you've got his gun.
4963	4965	Go on, you gray-haired old weasel.
4965	4967	Let me out of here!
4967	4970	Mother! I was looking all over for you. What happened?
4970	4971	Jake, hang on.
4971	4972	Hildy, call Duffy.
4972	4974	- No! - You want to see us scooped?
4974	4977	- Aim right for the center. - That's murder.
4977	4979	Okay, one of you get on each end of the desk.
4979	4981	- It's coming up. - You're covered.
4981	4982	- In a minute. - Don't move.
4982	4983	- Any time now. - I'll count three.
4984	4985	It's hot.
4985	4986	Ready?
4986	4987	Any second now.
4987	4989	Three. I got you, Williams.
4989	4991	- Go ahead, shoot me. - Come out.
4991	4994	Earl Williams was just captured in the criminal courts building.
4995	4997	- On your feet. - Don't try any funny stuff.
4998	4999	Williams was unconscious.
4999	5001	The police overpowered him.
5001	5004	- He offered no resistance. - His gun wouldn't work.
5005	5007	The Post turned Williams over to the sheriff.
5007	5009	- Put the cuffs on them. - More later.
5009	5013	An anonymous note led to Williams' capture. Hold on.
5013	5016	The sheriff's tracing a call that gave away Williams' hiding place.
5016	5018	- Where's the old lady? - She went out.
5018	5020	Call you back.
5029	5033	- Give me the warden's office. - You'll wish you'd never been born.
5033	5034	Will I?
5035	5037	- Hello, Fred. - Well, fine work, Pete.
5037	5040	- You delivered the goods. - Looks natural, don't it?
5040	5042	- Sight for sore eyes. - Aiding a criminal.
5042	5045	And a little charge of kidnapping... What's that?
5045	5046	But that's the jail.
5046	5049	Looks like about ten years apiece for you two birds.
5050	5052	When you think you've licked the Post, it's time to get out.
5053	5055	Whistling in the dark won't help. You're through.
5056	5059	Archie Leach said that to me a week before he cut his throat.
5059	5060	Is that so?
5060	5064	We've been in worse jams than this, haven't we, Hildy?
5064	5066	You forget the power that watches over the Post.
5067	5069	- It's not with you now. - Says you.
5069	5071	I've caught him. Yes, Williams.
5071	5074	Single-handed. Proceed to the hanging, per schedule.
5074	5076	You'll be in office exactly two days more.
5076	5078	We'll pull your nose out of that feedbag.
5078	5083	I tell you what you'll be doing. Making brooms in the penitentiary.
5083	5084	Joe? This is Hartwell.
5084	5086	Come to my office right away.
5086	5089	I captured a couple of important birds. Take their confessions.
5089	5090	Get Liebowitz.
5091	5093	The lawyers won't help you now.
5093	5095	You're talking to the Morning Post.
5095	5097	The power of the press?
5098	5101	Bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is.
5101	5102	Presidents, kings...
5102	5105	- Here's the reprieve. - Get out.
5105	5108	- You can't bribe me. My wife... - Get out.
5108	5111	- No, I won't. Here's the reprieve. - What?
5111	5113	I don't want to be a city sealer.
5113	5115	- Throw him out. - Out you go.
5115	5117	Wait. Who's trying to bribe you?
5117	5118	- They wouldn't take it. - Insane!
5118	5120	What did I say? An unseen power.
5121	5123	What do you mean with a story like that?
5123	5124	He's an imposter.
5125	5127	Trying to hang an innocent man to win an election, eh?
5128	5129	That's murder.
5129	5131	- I never saw him before. - Lf I was to...
5131	5133	- What's your name? - Pettibone.
5133	5135	- When did you deliver this first? - Who'd you talk to?
5136	5137	- They started to bribe me. - They?
5138	5140	- Those. Them. - It's absurd on the face of it.
5140	5141	He's talking like a child.
5142	5144	- Out of the mouths of babes. - Hi, babe.
5144	5145	He's insane or drunk.
5146	5150	If Williams has been reprieved, I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?
5150	5152	You'd hang your mother to be reelected.
5152	5154	That's a horrible thing to say about anybody.
5155	5157	You're marvelous. Take a look at that.
5157	5159	- You're an intelligent man. - Never mind.
5159	5161	Let's have your story.
5161	5164	- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs... - Skip all that.
5164	5167	She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then. She was one of the...
5167	5171	This document is authentic. Williams has been reprieved.
5171	5174	Our commonwealth has been saved the necessity of shedding blood.
5175	5178	Get off the soapbox. Save that for the Tribune.
5178	5180	Take those handcuffs off my friends.
5180	5182	- I'm amazed at you. - Isn't he awful?
5182	5185	You don't know how badly I feel.
5185	5187	No excuse at all for Pete.
5187	5189	- I was only doing my duty. - That's all right.
5189	5192	- What'd you say your name was? - Pettibone.
5192	5194	- Here's a picture of my wife. - Fine-looking woman.
5195	5196	- You haven't seen her yet. - She's all right.
5197	5200	She's good enough for me. If I was to tell...
5200	5203	I understand perfectly, and as long as I am mayor...
5204	5205	Which ought to be about Three more hours.
5206	5208	Enough to get out a special edition asking for your recall.
5208	5212	And your arrest. You boys ought to get about ten years apiece.
5212	5216	Don't make any hasty decisions. You might run into a libel suit.
5217	5218	You'll run into the governor.
5218	5221	We understand each other perfectly.
5221	5223	Yes, and so do I.
5223	5226	So do you what? And now, Mr. Pettibone...
5226	5230	...we'll deliver this reprieve to the warden's office. Come along.
5230	5233	- Lf I was to tell my wife... - You won't have to.
5235	5237	Wait till they read the Morning Post tomorrow.
5237	5238	Tight squeeze.
5238	5241	- Give me Duffy. - That's the worst jam.
5241	5242	What? Where? Get him.
5243	5246	Remember stealing Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the coroner?
5246	5248	Anytime you need this guy he's never there.
5248	5251	We proved she'd been poisoned, didn't we?
5251	5252	We had to hide out for a week.
5253	5254	Do you remember that?
5254	5257	The Shoreland Hotel. That's how we happened to...
5257	5260	We could have gone to jail for that too.
5260	5263	Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy. It's a bad business.
5263	5264	You'll be better off.
5265	5266	You better get going.
5266	5269	- Where would I go? - To Bruce, of course.
5269	5272	- You know he's gone. He took a train. - Send a wire.
5272	5275	He'll be waiting at the station when you get into Albany.
5275	5278	- Why doesn't he have a phone? - I don't know. I got us messed up...
5279	5282	- Get going, Hildy. - What is that with you?
5282	5285	Wait a minute. Can't you understand?
5285	5289	I'm trying to do something noble. Get out before I change my mind.
5289	5290	It's tough enough now.
5291	5293	- Just a minute. - Send him a wire. He'll be waiting.
5294	5296	- Who'll write the story? - I will. It won't be as good...
5297	5299	It's my story. I like to think that it...
5299	5303	- At last. - I get it. The same old act, isn't it?
5303	5305	Try to push me out, thinking I'll want to stay.
5306	5308	I know I deserve that. Wait a minute, Duffy.
5308	5310	This time you're wrong.
5310	5313	When you walk out that door, part of me will go right with you.
5314	5316	But a whole new world will open up for you.
5316	5319	I made fun of Bruce and Albany. You know why?
5319	5320	- Why? - I was jealous.
5320	5324	I was sore because he could offer you the kind of life I can't give you.
5324	5326	That's what you want, honey.
5326	5328	I could do the story and take the train...
5328	5331	Forget it. Come on. Come on.
5331	5333	Goodbye, dear, and good luck.
5337	5340	Duffy, now this is how it goes so far...
5340	5342	Just a minute.
5343	5345	Hello. Who? Hildy Johnson?
5346	5348	- She just left. - I'm still here. I can take it.
5348	5350	Hang on a minute.
5352	5354	Hildy Johnson speaking.
5355	5357	The Fourth Precinct Police Station?
5357	5358	Put him on.
5359	5362	I thought you were on your way to Albany...
5362	5363	What for?
5363	5365	For having counterfeit money.
5365	5367	Counterfeit money?
5367	5368	Hold on a minute.
5368	5370	Where did you get it?
5370	5372	I gave it to you?
5373	5376	All right. I'll try and do something about it.
5387	5388	Honey.
5389	5391	Honey, don't cry, please.
5392	5395	I didn't mean to make you cry. What's wrong? You never cried before.
5397	5401	I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce.
5402	5405	I didn't know you had him locked up.
5405	5408	I thought you were on the level, for once.
5409	5412	That you were just standing by and letting me go off with him...
5412	5414	...and not doing a thing about it.
5415	5417	Come on, honey. What did you think I was, a chump?
5417	5420	I thought you didn't love me.
5420	5422	What were you thinking with?
5422	5423	I don't know.
5424	5427	What are you standing there gawking for?
5427	5429	We have to get him out of jail.
5429	5432	Send Louie down with some honest money...
5432	5434	...and send him back to Albany.
5434	5435	Sure.
5436	5439	Everything's changed. We're coming over to the office.
5439	5442	Don't worry about the story. Hildy will write it.
5442	5445	She never intended to quit. We're getting married.
5445	5447	Can we go on a honeymoon this time?
5447	5448	Sure.
5448	5451	Duffy, you can be managing editor.
5451	5454	Not permanently. Just for the two weeks we're away.
5455	5456	I don't know where. Where are we going?
5457	5458	Niagara Falls.
5458	5461	- Niagara Falls. - Two whole weeks?
5461	5464	Sure, you've earned it. What?
5464	5467	What? A strike? What strike?
5467	5468	Where?
5469	5470	Albany?
5470	5473	- I know it's on the way, but... - Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.
5473	5475	Okay, Duffy.
5476	5479	Isn't that a coincidence! I wonder if Bruce can put us up.
5479	5481	Say, why don't you carry that in your hand?
