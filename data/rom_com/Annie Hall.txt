48	50	There's an old joke.
50	53	Two elderly women are at a Catskill mountain resort.
53	57	One says, "The food at this place is really terrible."
57	60	The other says, "l know, and such small portions."
60	63	That's essentially how l feel about life:
63	66	full of loneliness, misery, suffering and unhappiness...
66	70	and it's all over much too quickly.
70	72	The other important joke for me...
73	75	is one usually attributed to Groucho Marx...
75	79	but it appears originally in Freud's Wit and lts Relation to the Unconscious.
79	82	lt goes like this, l'm paraphrasing:
82	86	l never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member.
86	91	That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.
91	94	Lately the strangest things have been going through my mind...
94	98	because l turned 40, and l guess l'm going through a life crisis.
98	101	l'm not worried about aging. l'm not one of those characters.
101	104	But l'm balding slightly on top. That's about the worst you can say about me.
104	108	l think l'm going to get better as l get older.
108	111	l think l'm going to be the balding, virile type...
111	115	as opposed to the distinguished gray.
115	117	Unless l'm neither of those two.
117	119	Unless l'm one of those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth...
119	124	who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag, screaming about socialism.
125	129	Annie and l broke up, and l still can't get my mind around that.
129	132	l keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind...
132	137	examining my life and trying to figure out where did the screwup come.
137	140	A year ago we were in love.
142	146	lt's funny. l'm not a morose type. l'm not a depressive character.
147	149	l was a reasonably happy kid.
149	152	l was brought up in Brooklyn during World War ll.
154	156	He's been depressed.
156	158	- Suddenly he can't do anything. - Why are you depressed, Alvy?
158	163	Tell Dr. Flicker. lt's something he read.
163	165	Something he read, huh?
165	169	- The universe is expanding. - The universe is expanding?
169	172	The universe is everything, and if it's expanding...
172	176	someday it will break apart, and that will be the end of everything.
176	180	What is that your business? He stopped doing his homework!
180	184	- What's the point? - What's the universe got to do with it?
184	187	You're here in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is not expanding!
187	191	lt won't be expanding for billions of years!
191	196	We've got to try and enjoy ourselves while we're here! Huh?
202	204	My analyst says l exaggerate my childhood memories...
205	207	but l swear l was brought up underneath the roller coaster...
207	209	in the Coney lsland section of Brooklyn.
209	214	Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous.
214	218	l have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little.
218	222	l have some trouble between fantasy and reality.
223	225	My father ran the bumper-car concession.
225	228	There he is, and there l am.
228	232	l used to get my aggression out through those cars.
234	236	l remember the staff at our public school.
237	240	We had a saying, "Those who can't do, teach...
240	243	and those who can't teach, teach gym."
243	248	And those who couldn't do anything, l think, were assigned to our school.
250	253	l must say, l always thought my schoolmates were idiots.
253	256	Melvyn Greenglass and his fat little face.
256	259	And Henrietta Farrell, Miss Perfect all the time.
259	263	And lvan Ackerman, always the wrong answer. Always!
263	265	Seven and three is nine.
266	268	Even then l knew they were just jerks.
268	272	ln 1942 l had already discovered women.
274	277	He kissed me!
277	280	That's the second time this month! Step up here.
280	282	- What did l do? - Step up here.
282	285	- What did l do? - You should be ashamed of yourself.
285	288	Why? l was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
288	291	Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
291	292	l did.
293	296	For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks of a latency period!
296	300	l never had a latency period. l can't help it.
300	302	Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?
302	304	There was a model boy.
305	307	Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
307	311	l run a profitable dress company.
311	314	Sometimes l wonder where my classmates are today.
314	318	l'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.
319	321	l sell talliths.
321	326	l used to be a heroin addict, now l'm a methadone addict.
327	329	l'm into leather.
331	334	l lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but l wound up a comedian.
334	337	They did not take me in the army.
337	340	l was 4-P.
340	344	ln the event of war, l'm a hostage.
345	349	You always only saw the worst in people.
349	352	You never could get along with anyone in school.
352	354	You were always out of step with the world.
354	357	Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world.
357	361	l distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
361	363	- You're crazy. - No, l'm not.
363	366	We were walking off the tennis court. He was there and me and his wife.
366	368	He looked her, then they both looked at me...
368	370	and under his breath he said, "Jew."
371	373	You're a total paranoid.
373	376	How am l a paranoid? l pick up on those kind of things.
376	380	l was having lunch with guys from NBC, so l said, "Did you eat yet?"
380	385	Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?" Not "Did you?"
385	388	Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?" You get it?
388	391	- Max-- - Stop calling me Max.
391	395	Why? lt's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
395	397	No, l don't. l was in a record store. Listen to this.
397	403	There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy and he's looking at me in a funny way.
403	406	He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner."
406	409	Wagner, Max. l know what he's trying to tell me.
409	412	Very significantly, Wagner.
412	416	Right, Max. California, Max.
416	419	- Get the hell out of this crazy city. - Forget it.
419	422	We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there.
422	425	You keep bringing it up, but l don't want to live in a city...
425	429	where the only cultural advantage is you can make a right turn on a red light.
429	432	All right, forget it. Aren't you going to be late for meeting Annie?
432	435	l'm meeting her in front of the Beekman. l have a few minutes left, right?
452	454	Are you on television?
458	460	Yeah, occasionally.
460	462	What's your name?
462	464	You wouldn't know it. lt doesn't matter.
464	468	You're on Johnny Carson, right?
469	471	Once in a while.
471	473	What's your name?
473	477	- l'm Robert Redford. - Come on!
478	481	Alvy Singer. Thanks very much for everything.
484	486	This is Alvy Singer!
488	492	This guy's on television. Alvy Singer, right? Am l right?
492	494	- Give me a break. - This guy's on television.
494	496	l need the large polo mallet.
496	499	-Who's on television? -This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.
499	503	- ls this a meeting of the teamsters? - What program?
503	505	- Can l have your autograph? - You don't want my autograph.
505	508	l do! lt's for my girlfriend.
508	510	Make it out to Ralph.
510	514	- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph? - lt's for my brother.
518	520	You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?
521	525	- Alvy Singer over here! - lt's all right, fellas.
525	528	Jesus, what did you do? Come by way of the Panama Canal?
528	531	-l'm in a bad mood. -l'm here with the Godfather cast.
531	535	-Learn to deal with it. -l'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.
535	538	Please, l have a headache.
538	541	You are in a bad mood. You must be getting your period.
541	543	l'm not getting my period! Jesus!
543	546	Every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think l have my period.
546	549	A little louder. l think one of them may have missed it.
549	552	- Has the picture started? - Two minutes ago.
552	555	That's it. Forget it. l can't go in.
555	557	- Two minutes. - We've blown it already.
558	560	l can't go in, in the middle.
560	563	ln the middle? We've only missed the titles. They're in Swedish.
563	565	You want to get coffee for two hours?
565	568	- Two hours? No. l'm going in. - Go ahead. Good-bye.
568	571	While we're talking, we could be inside.
571	575	Can we not argue in front of everybody? l get embarrassed.
575	580	- All right. So what do you want to do? - l don't know. Go to another movie?
580	582	-Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity. -We've seen it.
582	585	l'm not in the mood to see a four hour documentary on Nazis.
585	587	l'm sorry.
587	592	l've got to see a picture exactly from start to finish, 'cause l'm anal.
592	594	That's a polite word for what you are.
597	601	We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday. lt is not one of his best.
601	603	lt lacks a cohesive structure.
603	607	You get the feeling he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.
607	612	l've always felt he was essentially a technical filmmaker.
612	615	Granted La Strada was a great film.
615	618	Great in its use of negative imagery more than anything else.
618	622	- l'm going to have a stroke. - Stop listening to him.
623	625	He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
625	629	All that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon.
629	632	l found it incredibly indulgent.
632	635	He really is one of the most indulgent of filmmakers.
635	638	Key word here is "indulgent."
639	643	- What are you depressed about? - l missed my therapy. l overslept.
643	645	How can you possibly oversleep?
645	647	The alarm clock.
647	649	You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
649	652	l know. Because of our sexual problem, right?
652	656	Everybody in line has to know our rate of intercourse?
656	658	lt's like Samuel Beckett.
658	662	l admire the technique, but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.
662	665	- l'd like to hit him on a gut level. - Stop it.
665	669	He's spitting on my neck when he talks.
669	672	You know something else? You're so egocentric that...
672	676	if l miss my therapy you can only think of it in terms of how it affects you!
678	680	They're probably on their first date.
680	684	Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books.
684	686	"Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman...
686	690	who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."
690	692	What do you mean "our sexual problem"?
692	694	l'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
694	698	l'm sorry. My sexual problem. Okay? My sexual problem!
699	703	l never read that. That was Henry James' sequel to Turn of the Screw?
703	705	lt's the influence of television.
705	711	Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high intensity.
711	713	Do you understand? A hot medium.
713	718	What l wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it.
718	722	What do you do when you get stuck on a movie line with a guy like this?
722	725	Wait. Why can't l give my opinion? lt's a free country!
725	727	He can. Do you have to give it so loud?
727	730	Aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that?
730	734	The funny part is, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan.
734	739	l happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV, Media and Culture."
739	743	l think my insights into Mr. McLuhan have a great deal of validity.
743	747	Do you? That's funny, because l happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here.
748	751	Just let me-- Come over here. Tell him.
751	753	l heard what you were saying.
753	758	You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.
758	761	How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing!
761	764	lf life were only like this.
767	771	June 14, 1940. The German army occupies Paris.
771	776	All over the country, people are desperate for food.
776	779	Those guys in the French Resistance were really brave.
779	782	To have to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
782	786	l know. Sometimes l ask myself how l'd stand up under torture.
786	788	You? You kidding?
788	792	The Gestapo would take away your charge card, and you'd tell 'em everything.
792	794	That movie makes me feel guilty.
794	796	lt's supposed to.
798	801	- Alvy, l-- - What?
801	803	What's the matter?
804	807	lt's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed together.
807	809	lt's been a long time!
809	811	lt's just, l mean--
811	814	l've got to sing tomorrow night, so l have to rest my voice.
814	817	lt's always some kind of an excuse. You used to think l was very sexy.
818	820	When we first started going out, we had sex constantly.
820	823	We're probably listed in The Guiness Book of World Records.
823	827	lt'll pass. l'm going through a phase, that's all.
827	829	You've been married before. You know how things can get.
830	832	You were very hot for Allison at first.
836	840	You know that you're on right after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.
841	843	Excuse me. When do l go on?
843	845	Who are you?
845	847	Alvy Singer.
847	850	- l'm the comedian. - Oh, comedian.
850	853	Oh, you're on next.
853	855	What do you mean "next"?
855	857	You're on right after this act.
857	860	- lt can't be, because he's a comic. - Yes.
860	863	- You're putting on two comics in a row? - Why not?
864	867	No, l'm sorry. l'm not going to go on after another comedian.
867	871	- lt's okay. - No. They're laughing. l'd rather not.
871	874	Will you relax, please? They're going to love you.
874	877	l know. l prefer not to. Look, they're laughing at him.
877	879	What are you telling me? They'll laugh at him a few minutes.
879	882	Then l've got to get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?
883	885	- They're laughed out. - Do you feel all right?
885	888	Jesus.
889	892	- What's your name? - Allison.
892	894	Yeah? Allison what?
894	896	Portchnik.
897	900	- Portchnik? That's nice. - Thank you.
903	907	So, you work for Stevenson all the time?
907	911	- No. l'm doing my thesis. - On what?
912	915	Political commitment in 20th-century literature.
915	918	You're like New York Jewish, left-wing, intellectual...
918	921	Central Park West, Brandeis University, socialist summer camps...
922	925	and the father with the Ben Shahn drawings...
925	928	really strike-oriented--
928	930	Stop me before l make a complete imbecile of myself.
930	935	That was wonderful! l love being reduced to a cultural stereotype.
935	938	Right. l'm a bigot, but for the left.
940	945	l have to go out there. Say something encouraging, quickly.
945	948	- l think you're cute. - Yeah? Do you?
949	951	Go ahead.
961	964	l don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally...
964	968	'cause l'm not essentially a political comedian.
968	973	l interestingly had dated a woman...
973	976	in the Eisenhower administration, briefly.
976	979	lt was ironic to me...
980	983	'cause l was trying to do to her...
983	986	what Eisenhower's been doing to the country for the last eight years.
990	992	l'm sorry. l can't go through with this.
992	996	l can't get it off my mind! lt's obsessing me!
996	999	l'm getting tired of it. l need your attention.
999	1003	But it doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository...
1003	1006	and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.
1006	1011	So how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once?
1011	1013	lt doesn't make sense!
1014	1018	l'll tell you this. He was not marksman enough...
1018	1020	to hit a moving target at that range.
1020	1025	But if there was a second assassin--
1025	1027	- That's it! - We've been through this.
1028	1030	They recovered the shells from that rifle.
1030	1032	What are you saying now?
1032	1037	That everybody on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
1037	1039	Why not?
1039	1043	- Earl Warren? - Honey, l don't know Earl Warren.
1043	1045	Lyndon Johnson?
1045	1047	Lyndon Johnson is a politician!
1047	1052	You know the ethics those guys have. lt's a notch underneath child molester.
1052	1054	Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.
1054	1060	The FBl and the ClA and J. Edgar Hoover, the oil companies...
1060	1063	the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant at the White House?
1063	1066	l would leave out the men's-room attendant.
1067	1072	You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
1072	1075	Oh, my God! She's right.
1075	1078	Why did l turn off Allison Portchnik?
1078	1082	She was beautiful. She was willing. She was real intelligent.
1082	1085	ls it the old Groucho Marx joke...
1085	1089	that l don't want to belong to any club that would have me for a member?
1089	1092	- Alvy, don't panic! - lt's a mistake...
1092	1094	to bring a live thing in the house.
1094	1096	Don't do that.
1096	1100	Maybe we should call the police. Dial 911. lt's the lobster squad.
1100	1102	They're only baby ones. For God sakes.
1103	1106	- lf they're babies, you pick them up. - All right! All right!
1106	1109	- Here you go! - Don't give it to me.
1109	1112	Look! One crawled behind the refrigerator.
1112	1116	lt'll turn up in our bed at night. Get out of here with that thing!
1118	1120	Talk to him. You speak shellfish.
1120	1123	Hey, put it in the pot.
1123	1127	l can't. l can't put a live thing in hot water.
1127	1129	What d'you think we were going to do, take him to the movies?
1129	1131	Good. Oh, thank you.
1131	1134	Okay, it's in. lt's definitely in the pot.
1134	1137	Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator.
1137	1140	l can't get it out. This thing's heavy.
1140	1144	Maybe if l put a dish of butter sauce here, it'll run out the other side.
1144	1146	l'm going to get my camera.
1146	1149	l think if l could pry--
1149	1152	We should have gotten steaks, 'cause they don't have legs and run around.
1156	1159	- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please. - You're going to take pictures now?
1159	1163	Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!
1163	1167	- lt's disgusting. - One more, please? One more.
1167	1168	Good!
1168	1172	Here's what l want to know. Am l your first, big romance?
1174	1178	- Who was? - There was Dennis from high school.
1178	1183	Local kid who'd meet you in front of the movie house on Saturday night?
1183	1188	- You should've seen how l looked then. - l can imagine. An astronaut's wife.
1188	1191	- Then there was Jerry, the actor. - Look at you.
1191	1193	You're such a clown.
1193	1197	- l look pretty. - You always do. But that guy with you!
1197	1201	Acting is like an exploration of the soul. lt's very religious.
1201	1205	Like a kind of liberating consciousness.
1205	1207	lt's like a visual poem.
1207	1209	ls he kidding with that crap?
1210	1212	Oh, right!
1212	1215	Right. l think l know exactly what you mean when you say "religious."
1215	1218	- You do? - Come on. l was younger.
1218	1220	That was last year!
1220	1223	lt's like when l think of dying. You know how l'd like to die?
1223	1225	How?
1225	1228	l'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.
1228	1232	- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels. - He was a terrific actor.
1232	1235	He's neat looking and he was emotional.
1235	1237	l don't think you like emotion too much.
1238	1240	Touch my heart with your foot.
1240	1242	l may throw up.
1242	1245	- He was creepy. - Yeah!
1245	1250	- You're pretty lucky l came along. - Oh, really? La-de-dah!
1250	1254	lf anyone ever told me that l'd be taking out a girl...
1254	1256	who used expressions like "la-de-dah"--
1256	1260	That's right. You really like those New York girls.
1260	1263	- Not just. Not only. - l'd say so. You married two of them.
1263	1264	There's Henry Drucker.
1264	1266	There's Henry Drucker.
1266	1268	He has a Chair in History at Princeton.
1268	1272	The short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.
1272	1274	Two more chairs, they got a dining room set.
1274	1278	- Why are you so hostile? - l want to watch the Knicks on TV.
1278	1280	ls that Paul Goodman? No.
1280	1283	Be nice to the host, because he's publishing my book.
1283	1286	Hi, Doug. Douglas Wyeth...
1286	1289	The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop of the Heart.
1289	1291	l'm so tired of spending evenings...
1291	1293	making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
1293	1295	Commentary.
1295	1299	l heard Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
1299	1302	No jokes. These are friends. Okay?
1302	1305	Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New York Knicks.
1305	1310	Here you are. There's people out there.
1310	1312	Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead 14 points...
1312	1315	and now they're ahead two points.
1315	1319	Alvy, what is so fascinating...
1319	1324	about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?
1324	1326	What is fascinating is that it's physical.
1326	1328	That's one thing about intellectuals:
1328	1332	They've proved you can be brilliant and have no idea what's going on.
1332	1337	But, on the other hand, the body doesn't lie as we now know.
1338	1340	Stop acting out.
1340	1343	lt'll be great, because all those Ph.D.s are in there discussing...
1343	1347	modes of alienation, and we'll be in here quietly humping.
1347	1351	Don't. You're using sex to express hostility.
1351	1356	"Why do you always reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...
1356	1359	he said as he removed her brassier.
1361	1365	There are people out there from the New Yorker magazine!
1366	1369	My God! What would they think?
1375	1378	- Damn siren! - Don't get upset.
1378	1380	Damn it! l was so close!
1380	1383	Last night it was a guy honking his car horn.
1383	1386	The city can't close down.
1386	1390	You want them to close the airport so we can have sex?
1390	1392	l'm too tense. l need a Valium.
1392	1395	My analyst says l should live in the country and not in New York.
1396	1399	We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous.
1399	1403	You've got crickets. lt's quiet. There's no place to walk after dinner.
1403	1406	There's the screens with the dead moths behind them.
1406	1409	You got the Manson family, possibly. You got Dick and Perry.
1409	1414	Okay! My analyst just thinks l'm too tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?
1414	1417	Okay, it's quiet now. We can get started again.
1417	1420	l can't! My head is throbbing.
1420	1422	- You got a headache? - l have a headache!
1422	1425	- Bad? - Like Oswald in Ghosts.
1425	1427	- Jesus. - Where are you going?
1427	1431	l'm going to take another in a series of cold showers.
1431	1433	Max, my serve is going to send you to the showers early.
1433	1435	Right. To get back to what we were discussing.
1435	1439	The failure of the country to get behind New York City is anti-Semitism.
1439	1441	Max, the city is terribly run.
1441	1444	l'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
1444	1448	That's a convenient out. When some group disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.
1448	1451	The rest of the country looks upon New York...
1451	1455	like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish, homosexual pornographers.
1455	1457	l think of us that way sometimes, and l live here.
1458	1462	Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day in the sun.
1462	1465	Sun is bad for you. Everything our parents said was good is bad.
1465	1468	Sun, milk, red meat, college.
1470	1472	Egad, here he comes.
1475	1478	You know Alvy? This is Janet.
1478	1481	- This is Annie Hall. - This is Alvy.
1481	1485	- Who's playing with who here? - You and me against them?
1485	1487	- That's not fair. - l can't play too good.
1487	1489	l've had four lessons.
1512	1514	Well...
1514	1515	bye.
1519	1522	- You play very well. - Oh, yeah? So do you!
1522	1525	God, what a dumb thing to say.
1525	1530	You say "You play well," and right away l have to say, "You play well."
1530	1532	Oh, God, Annie.
1532	1536	Well. Oh, well!
1536	1538	La-de-dah.
1539	1541	You want a lift?
1541	1546	Oh, why? You got a car?
1546	1548	No, l was going to take a cab.
1549	1551	Oh, no. l have a car.
1552	1554	You have a car?
1556	1558	lf you have a car...
1558	1562	then why did you say, "Do you have a car" like you wanted a lift?
1564	1567	Geez, l don't know. l wasn't--
1568	1572	l got this VW out there.
1572	1573	What a jerk.
1574	1576	Would you like a lift?
1576	1581	- Sure. Which way are you going? - Me? Oh, downtown.
1581	1583	l'm going uptown.
1583	1585	Oh, l'm going uptown, too.
1585	1589	- You said you were going downtown. - Yeah, well--
1589	1591	l can go uptown, too. l live uptown.
1591	1595	What the hell? lt would be nice having company. l hate driving alone.
1596	1599	How long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
1599	1601	- l'm in her acting class. - You're an actress!
1602	1604	Well, l do commercials, sort of.
1604	1607	You want to watch the road? You're not from New York, right?
1607	1610	- Chippewa Falls. - Right.
1610	1612	- Where? - Wisconsin.
1613	1616	- You're driving a tad rapidly. - Don't worry. l'm a very good driver.
1618	1621	- You want some gum? - No, thanks.
1621	1624	- Where is it? - Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.
1624	1626	l'll get it. Concentrate, will ya?
1626	1629	- l'll get you a piece. - Listen. You drive?
1629	1632	Do l drive? No, l got a problem with driving.
1632	1634	- You do? - Yeah.
1634	1637	l got a license, but l have too much hostility.
1639	1641	Nice car. You keep it nice.
1641	1645	- Can l ask you, is this a sandwich? - Oh, yeah.
1650	1654	l live over here. Oh, my God, look! There's a parking space.
1659	1662	That's okay, we can walk to the curb from here.
1663	1666	You want your tennis stuff? You want your gear?
1666	1669	Yeah. That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well.
1669	1670	Well.
1672	1674	- Thank you. - Thank you.
1674	1677	You're a wonderful tennis player...
1677	1680	and you're the worst driver l've ever seen in my life.
1680	1683	Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.
1683	1686	- l love what you're wearing. - You do? Yeah.
1686	1690	This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.
1690	1693	Who? Grammy Hall?
1693	1695	Yeah, my grammy.
1695	1698	What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?
1698	1702	- lt's pretty silly, isn't it? - My grammy never gave gifts.
1702	1705	She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
1705	1708	Well, thank you again.
1708	1709	Oh, yeah.
1709	1713	Listen. You want to come upstairs and have a glass of wine or something?
1713	1717	No, l mean you don't have to. You're probably late and everything.
1717	1719	No, that would be fine. l wouldn't mind. Sure.
1719	1724	l got time. l got nothing until my analyst appointment.
1724	1726	You see an analyst?
1726	1730	- Just for 15 years. - 15 years?
1730	1732	l'm going to give him one more year, and then l'm going to Lourdes.
1732	1735	15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?
1736	1739	Sylvia Plath. lnteresting poetess whose tragic suicide...
1739	1743	was misinterpreted as romantic by the college-girl mentality.
1744	1747	Right. l don't know. l mean, some of her poems seem neat.
1748	1751	Neat? l hate to tell you this is 1975.
1751	1753	"Neat" went out at the turn of the century.
1753	1756	Who are those photos on the wall?
1756	1758	Oh, you see...
1759	1763	that's my dad, that's Father, and that's my brother, Duane.
1763	1766	Yeah, right. And over there's Grammy Hall.
1766	1769	- And that's Sadie. - Who's Sadie?
1769	1774	Well, Sadie met Grammy through Grammy's brother, George.
1774	1777	George was real sweet. He had that thing.
1777	1782	What is that thing where you fall asleep in the middle of a sentence?
1782	1784	- Narcolepsy. - Right.
1784	1789	So anyway, George went to the union to get his free turkey...
1789	1793	because the union always gave George this free turkey at Christmastime...
1793	1797	because he was shell-shocked in the first World War.
1797	1801	Anyway, so George is standing in line...
1801	1803	getting his free turkey...
1803	1808	but the thing is he falls asleep, and he never wakes up.
1808	1811	So he's dead.
1811	1813	He's dead. Yeah.
1813	1815	Oh, dear.
1815	1818	Well, terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say?
1818	1820	Pretty awful.
1820	1823	lt's a great story, though. lt really made my day.
1823	1826	l think l should get out of here, 'cause l think l'm imposing.
1826	1829	Really? Maybe--
1829	1834	- You don't have to. - But l'm all perspired and everything.
1834	1836	Didn't you take a shower at the club?
1836	1839	No, no. l never shower in a public place.
1839	1841	Why not?
1841	1845	l don't like to get naked in front of another man.
1845	1846	l see.
1846	1850	l don't like to show my body to a man of my gender.
1850	1852	- l see, l guess. - You never know what's going to happen.
1853	1856	- 15 years, huh? - 15 years, yeah.
1857	1858	God bless.
1862	1865	Well! Well--
1866	1869	You're what Grammy Hall would call "a real Jew."
1872	1873	Thank you.
1874	1877	She hates Jews. She thinks they just make money.
1878	1881	But she's the one, is she ever. l'm telling you.
1886	1888	So, did you do those photographs in there?
1889	1893	l dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk. Yeah, l sort of dabble around, you know.
1894	1898	You are a great-looking girl. They're wonderful. They have a quality.
1898	1902	He probably thinks l'm a yo-yo. Well, l would like to take a serious photography course.
1902	1904	Photography's interesting because...
1904	1908	l wonder what she looks like naked. it's a new art form. A set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.
1908	1912	l'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there. You mean whether it's a good photo or not?
1912	1917	l don't know what l'm saying. She senses l'm shallow. The medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself.
1917	1922	God, l hope he doesn't turn out to be a schmuck like the others. Well, to me-- l mean-- lt's all instinctive.
1922	1927	l just try to feel it, to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.
1927	1933	Christ, l sound like FM radio. Relax. Still, you need aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective.
1935	1938	l don't know. l mean, l guess you must be sort of late.
1938	1943	You know, l've got to get there and begin whining soon.
1943	1945	Are you busy Friday night?
1945	1948	Me? Oh, no.
1948	1951	Oh, l'm sorry, l have something. What about Saturday night?
1953	1955	Nothing. No, no.
1955	1959	You're very popular, l can see.
1959	1961	- l know. - You have plague?
1961	1963	l meet a lot of jerks.
1963	1965	l meet a lot of jerks, too.
1965	1968	l'm thinking about getting some cats.
1969	1972	Wait a second! No, no! Oh, shoot!
1972	1977	Saturday night, l'm going to sing.
1977	1979	You're going to sing? You sing? No kidding!
1979	1982	- This is my first time. - Really? Where?
1983	1985	l'd like to come.
1985	1988	- l'm interested. - No, no. l'm just a--
1988	1992	l'm auditioning at this club. lt's my first time.
1992	1994	That's okay, 'cause l know exactly what that's like.
1994	1997	You're going to like nightclubs. They're really a lot of fun.
2003	2005	lt had to be you
2008	2015	lt had to be you
2016	2021	l wandered around And finally found
2021	2028	This somebody who
2029	2035	Could make me be true
2035	2040	Could make me be blue
2042	2045	And even be glad
2045	2047	Just to be sad
2049	2055	Thinking of you
2055	2058	l was awful! l'm so ashamed! l can't sing.
2058	2060	So the audience was a tad restless.
2060	2064	What do you mean, "a tad restless"? My God, they hated me!
2064	2066	No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
2066	2068	- l'm going to quit. - l'm not going to let you.
2068	2071	- You have a great voice. - Do you think so, really?
2071	2075	- Yeah! lt's terrific. - l never even took a lesson either.
2075	2079	- Listen, give me a kiss. - Really?
2079	2081	Why not? Because we're just going to go home later.
2081	2084	There's going to be all that tension. We've never kissed before.
2084	2086	l'll never know when to make the right move.
2086	2089	We'll kiss now and get it over with, and then we'll go eat. Okay?
2089	2091	We'll digest our food better.
2093	2096	Okay? Now we can digest our food.
2096	2099	Corned beef, please.
2099	2102	l'm having pastrami on white bread...
2102	2105	with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.
2108	2111	So, your second wife left you.
2111	2113	Were you depressed about that?
2113	2117	Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
2117	2121	- Your first wife, Allison. - She was nice.
2121	2124	That was my fault. l was too crazy.
2128	2131	That was so nice! That was nice.
2131	2135	As Balzac said, "There goes another novel."
2136	2138	You were great.
2138	2141	Oh, yeah? Yeah?
2141	2145	- Yeah, l'm wrecked. - You're wrecked.
2145	2149	l mean it. l'll never play the piano again.
2150	2153	lt was, l don't know. You really thought it was good?
2153	2158	Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun l've had without laughing.
2158	2160	Here, you want some?
2160	2166	No, l don't use any major hallucinogenics.
2166	2170	l took a puff about five years ago at a party...
2170	2173	and tried to take my pants off over my head.
2176	2181	l don't do it very often. lt just sort of relaxes me.
2183	2186	- You won't believe this, but-- - What?
2190	2193	l'm going to buy you these books...
2193	2196	because l think you should read them instead of that cat book.
2196	2199	That's pretty serious stuff.
2199	2202	l'm obsessed with death, l think.
2202	2205	lt's a big subject with me. l have a pessimistic view of life.
2205	2207	You should know this about me if we're going to go out.
2207	2210	l feel that life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
2210	2212	Those are the two categories.
2212	2217	The horrible would be like terminal cases and blind people, cripples.
2217	2220	l don't know how they get through life. lt's amazing to me.
2220	2223	And the miserable is everyone else.
2223	2225	So when you go through life, be thankful that you're miserable.
2225	2228	You're very lucky to be miserable.
2229	2234	Look at that guy. There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.
2234	2237	He's just come back from the gin rummy finals.
2237	2239	He placed third.
2239	2242	Look at these guys. That's hilarious. They're back from Fire lsland.
2242	2245	They're sort of giving it a chance romantically.
2245	2248	- ltalian, right? - Him? He's the Mafia.
2248	2251	Linen supply business or cement and contracting.
2252	2255	Oh, gee, mess up my moustache wax.
2255	2258	There's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
2258	2263	You are unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are.
2263	2267	You know what you are? You're polymorphously perverse.
2267	2269	What does that mean? l don't know what that is.
2269	2272	You're exceptional in bed...
2272	2275	because you get pleasure in every part of your body when l touch it.
2276	2279	Like the tip of your nose, and if l stroke your teeth or your knee caps...
2279	2282	you certainly get excited.
2282	2286	You know what? l like you, l really do.
2286	2289	But do you love me? That's the key question.
2289	2291	l know you've only known me a short while.
2291	2295	l think that's sort of-- Yeah, yeah.
2296	2297	Do you love me?
2298	2303	Love is too weak a word for what-- l "lurve" you.
2303	2307	l "loave" you. l "luff" you, with two "f"s.
2307	2310	Of course l do. Don't you think l do?
2310	2312	l don't know.
2314	2317	What do you mean? You're not going to give up your own apartment, are you?
2317	2319	- Of course. - But why?
2319	2321	l'm moving in with you, that's why.
2321	2324	- But you have a nice apartment. - l have a tiny apartment.
2324	2327	- l know it's small. - And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
2327	2332	Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs. You say that like it's a negative.
2332	2334	Bugs are--
2334	2338	- Entomology is a rapidly growing field. - You don't want me to live with you.
2338	2342	- l don't? Whose idea was it? - Mine.
2342	2345	lt was yours, actually.
2345	2347	But l approved it immediately.
2347	2349	You think l talked you into something.
2349	2354	No. We live together, we sleep together, we eat together.
2354	2356	Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do you?
2356	2360	- How is it any different? - Because you keep your own apartment.
2360	2363	lt's there. We don't have to go to it, deal with it...
2363	2368	but it's like a free-floating life raft that we know that we're not married.
2368	2370	That little apartment is $400 a month, Alvy.
2371	2374	- That place is $400 a month? - Yes, it is.
2374	2377	lt's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus.
2377	2381	My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction. l'll pay for it.
2381	2384	You don't think l'm smart enough to be serious about.
2384	2385	Don't be ridiculous.
2385	2390	Then why are you always pushing me to take college courses like l was dumb?
2390	2392	Adult education is a wonderful thing!
2392	2395	You meet a lot of interesting professors. lt's stimulating.
2408	2412	Does this sound like a good course: "Modern American Poetry"?
2413	2415	Or, let's see...
2415	2419	maybe l should take "lntroduction to the Novel."
2419	2422	Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
2422	2424	What?
2424	2429	What do you think? Should we go to that party in South Hampton?
2429	2432	No, don't be silly. What do we need other people for?
2432	2437	We should just turn out the lights and play hide the "salam" or something.
2437	2440	Well, l'm going to get a cigarette, okay?
2440	2446	Grass, right? The illusion that it makes a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
2446	2449	- Have you ever made love high? - Me? No.
2449	2453	lf l have grass or alcohol, l get unbearably wonderful.
2453	2456	l get too wonderful for words.
2456	2460	l don't know why you have to get high every time we make love.
2460	2462	lt relaxes me.
2462	2464	You have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
2464	2466	What's the difference, anyway?
2466	2469	l'll give you a shot of Sodium Pentothal. You can sleep through it.
2469	2473	Look who's talking! You've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years.
2473	2476	You should smoke some of this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
2476	2478	- Come on, you don't need that. - What are you doing?
2479	2482	- No, Alvy, please? - You can live without it once.
2484	2486	Wait, l got a great idea.
2488	2492	Hang in there for a second. l got a little erotic artifact...
2492	2496	that l brought up from the city, which l think is going to be perfect.
2496	2500	There. Create a little old New Orleans essence.
2500	2504	Now we can go about our business...
2504	2507	and even develop photographs if we want to.
2514	2517	- ls something wrong? - No, why?
2517	2520	l don't know. lt's like you're removed.
2520	2522	No, l'm fine.
2522	2524	Really?
2524	2526	l don't know. You seem sort of distant.
2526	2528	Let's just do it, all right?
2529	2532	Was it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
2532	2534	Alvy, do you remember where l put my drawing pad?
2534	2537	Because while you two are doing that, l'm going to do some drawing.
2537	2540	That's what l call removed!
2540	2543	You have my body.
2543	2545	But l want the whole thing!
2545	2547	l need grass.
2547	2550	lt ruins it for me if you have grass.
2550	2554	l'm like a comedian, so if l get a laugh from a person who's high...
2554	2556	it doesn't count, 'cause they're always laughing.
2557	2558	Were you always funny?
2559	2561	ls this an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
2561	2565	This guy is naturally funny. l think he can write for you.
2565	2568	Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good.
2568	2570	Let me explain how l work. You can tell off the bat...
2570	2573	that l don't look like a funny guy like some of the guys.
2573	2575	You know they're going to tell you their stories, you're going to fall down.
2576	2578	But l gotta be really talented. Material's got to be sensational for me.
2578	2582	l work-- l'm kind of classy. Know what l mean?
2582	2585	Let me explain. l'll open with an opening song.
2585	2587	The music will start.
2587	2590	l walk out. Place looks wonderful from here
2590	2592	You folks look wonderful from here
2593	2595	And seeing you there With a smile on your face
2595	2598	Makes me shout This must be the place
2598	2601	l stop, and then l open with some jokes. That's where l need you.
2601	2605	l'll say, "l just got back from Canada. They speak a lot of French.
2605	2609	The only word to know is 'John Dark.' lt means the light's out in the bathroom.
2609	2613	- l met a big lumberjack." - Jesus, this guy's pathetic.
2613	2617	Look at him mincing around. Boy, thinks he's real cute.
2617	2619	You want to throw up.
2619	2622	lf only l had the nerve to do my own jokes.
2624	2627	l don't know how much longer l can keep this smile frozen on my face.
2627	2629	l'm in the wrong business. l know it.
2629	2633	"But, cherie...
2633	2636	what will l do with this, eh?"
2636	2640	He says, "Oh, Marie, sometime you make me so mad!"
2640	2642	They scream at that. Write me something like that, will you?
2642	2645	Kind of a French number. Can you do it?
2651	2653	Where am l? l have to reorient myself.
2653	2655	This is the University of Wisconsin, right?
2655	2660	Because l'm always tense when l'm playing a college.
2660	2663	l have a bad history with colleges. l went to New York University.
2663	2667	And l was thrown out of NYU my freshman year...
2667	2670	for cheating on my metaphysics final.
2670	2674	l looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me.
2674	2679	My mother, an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom...
2679	2682	and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.
2685	2689	l was depressed at that time. l was in analysis.
2689	2693	l was suicidal, as a matter of fact, and would have killed myself...
2693	2695	but l was in analysis with a strict Freudian.
2696	2699	And if you kill yourself, they make you pay for the sessions you miss.
2703	2707	Alvy, you were just great. l'm not kidding.
2707	2710	College audiences are wonderful.
2710	2713	You know what? l think l'm starting to get more of the references, too.
2713	2717	Are you? The 12:00 show is completely different than the 9:00.
2718	2722	l'm looking forward to tomorrow. lt'll be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.
2722	2724	They'll hate me immediately.
2725	2729	No, l don't think they're going to hate you at all. Contrary.
2729	2733	lt's Easter. We'll sit down and eat. l think they'll really like you.
2742	2744	lt's a nice ham this year, Mom.
2746	2749	Grammy always does such a good job.
2749	2751	Great sauce.
2751	2754	lt is. lt's dynamite ham.
2759	2762	We went to the swap meet.
2762	2765	Annie, Gram and l. Got some nice picture frames.
2765	2769	We really had a good time.
2769	2773	Ann tells us you've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years.
2774	2776	Yes. l'm making excellent progress.
2777	2780	Soon, when l lie down on his couch, l won't have to wear the lobster bib.
2782	2786	- Duane and l went to the boat basin. - We caulked hulls all day.
2786	2789	And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.
2789	2793	That Randolph Hunt! You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.
2793	2796	- He was in the choir with you. - Oh, yes.
2796	2799	l can't believe this family.
2799	2802	Annie's mother is really beautiful.
2802	2806	And they're talking swap meets and boat basins.
2806	2810	The old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew-hater.
2810	2815	They really look American, healthy, like they never get sick or anything.
2815	2818	Nothing like my family. The two are like oil and water.
2819	2822	Ah, let him drop dead. Who needs his business?
2822	2827	- His wife has diabetes. - Diabetes? ls that an excuse?
2827	2832	The man is 50 years old and doesn't have a substantial job.
2832	2834	ls that a reason to steal from your partner?
2834	2836	You don't know what you're talking about.
2836	2838	Defend him!
2838	2841	Pass the brisket.
2841	2843	Mo Moskowitz. He had a coronary.
2843	2845	You don't say!
2846	2849	How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer?
2849	2851	- We fast. - Fast?
2851	2854	No food. You know, to atone for our sins.
2854	2856	What sins? l don't understand.
2856	2858	Neither do we.
2860	2863	Hi, Duane. How's it going?
2863	2867	- This is my room. - Oh, yeah? lt's terrific.
2867	2869	Can l confess something?
2875	2878	l tell you this, because, as an artist, l think you'll understand.
2881	2884	Sometimes when l'm driving...
2884	2886	on the road at night...
2886	2889	l see two headlights coming toward me, fast.
2889	2892	l have this impulse to turn the wheel quickly...
2892	2894	head-on into the oncoming car.
2895	2898	l can anticipate the explosion.
2898	2902	The sound of shattering glass.
2902	2906	The flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
2909	2910	Right.
2912	2917	l have to go now, Duane, because l'm due back on the planet Earth.
2918	2919	Don't let it be so long now.
2920	2923	- Look up Uncle Billy, promise. - He is adorable.
2923	2926	- You'll take them to the airport now? - No. Duane can.
2926	2929	- l haven't finished my drink. - Yes, Duane is. l'll be right--
2949	2951	You followed me. l can't believe it!
2951	2953	- l didn't follow you. - You followed me!
2953	2956	Because l was walking a block behind staring at you? That's not following.
2956	2960	- What's your definition of "following"? - Following is different. l was spying.
2960	2961	Do you realize how paranoid you are?
2962	2965	Paranoid? l'm looking at you, and you've got your arms around another guy.
2965	2967	That is the worst kind of paranoid!
2967	2970	l didn't start out spying. l thought l'd surprise you, pick you up after school.
2970	2974	You wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? lt's your phrase.
2974	2976	You're having an affair with your college professor!
2976	2981	That jerk that teaches that crap course, "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man."
2981	2984	"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature." You're really close.
2984	2986	What's the difference? lt's all mental masturbation.
2986	2989	Now we're getting to a subject you know something about.
2989	2992	Don't knock masturbation. lt's sex with someone l love.
2992	2997	We're not having an affair. He's married. He happens to think l'm neat.
2997	3000	Are you 12 years old? That's one of your Chippewa Falls expressions.
3000	3002	Who cares?
3002	3005	Next he'll find you're keen and peachy. Then he'll have his hand on your ass.
3005	3008	You've had hostility towards David ever since l mentioned him.
3009	3011	- You call your teacher David? - lt's his name.
3011	3014	lt's a Biblical name, right? Does he call you Bathsheba?
3014	3019	Alvy, you're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment.
3019	3022	You don't think l'm smart enough. We had that argument last month...
3022	3025	or don't you remember that day?
3026	3029	- l'm home! - How'd it go?
3029	3032	lt was really weird, but she's a very nice woman.
3032	3036	l didn't have to lie on the couch. She had me sitting up.
3036	3040	l told her about the family and my feelings towards men...
3040	3042	and my relationship with my brother.
3042	3045	Then she mentioned penis envy. Do you know about that?
3045	3049	l'm one of the few males who suffers from that. Go on.
3049	3054	She said l was guilty about my impulses towards marriage and children.
3054	3058	Then, l remembered, when l was a kid, l accidentally saw my parents making love.
3058	3061	All this happened the first hour? That's amazing.
3061	3065	l've been going for 15 years. l don't have nothing like that.
3065	3067	l told her my dream, and then l cried.
3067	3070	You cried. l've never once cried. That's fantastic to me.
3071	3073	l whine. l sit and l whine.
3073	3077	ln my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this pillow across my face...
3077	3079	and l can't breathe.
3079	3081	He's strangling me.
3081	3084	Sure, because he's a singer, and you're a singer. lt's perfect.
3084	3087	You're trying to suffocate yourself. lt makes perfect sense.
3087	3089	That's a perfect analytic insight.
3089	3093	She said your name was Alvy Singer.
3093	3095	- What do you mean, me? - Yeah, you.
3095	3098	Because in the dream, l break Sinatra's glasses.
3098	3103	You never said Sinatra had glasses. Are you saying l'm suffocating you?
3103	3106	God, l did this really terrible thing to him...
3107	3111	because then when he sang, it was in this real high-pitch voice.
3111	3115	- What'd the doctor say? - l should come five times a week.
3115	3120	l don't think l mind analysis at all. The question is, will it change my wife?
3120	3123	- Will it change your wife? - Will it change my life?
3123	3127	- But you said "wife." - No, l said "life."
3127	3129	- No, you said "wife." - "Life!" l said "life."
3129	3133	She said "wife." You heard that, because you were there. l'm not crazy.
3133	3137	Then l told her l didn't think you'd ever take me seriously...
3137	3139	because you don't think l'm smart enough.
3139	3143	Why do you bring that up? Because l encourage you to take adult education?
3143	3147	lt's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors.
3147	3151	Adult education is junk. The professors are phony. How can you do it?
3151	3154	l don't care what you say about David. He's a fine teacher.
3154	3159	And why are you following me around? We should call this relationship quits.
3159	3162	That's fine. That's great. l don't know what l did wrong.
3162	3166	Somewhere she cooled off to me. ls it something that l did?
3166	3169	lt's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades.
3169	3172	Love fades. God, that's a depressing thought.
3172	3175	l have to ask you a question. Don't go any further.
3175	3178	With your wife, in bed, does she need some kind of artificial stimulation...
3178	3181	like marijuana?
3181	3183	We use a large vibrating egg.
3183	3185	A large vibrating egg.
3185	3189	l ask a psychopath, l get that kind of answer. Jesus!
3189	3192	You look like a very happy couple.
3192	3195	- Are you? - Yeah.
3195	3197	How do you account for it?
3197	3201	l'm very shallow and empty, and l have no ideas...
3201	3204	and nothing interesting to say.
3204	3207	- l'm exactly the same way. - l see.
3207	3210	That's interesting. So you've managed to work out something?
3210	3212	Right.
3212	3214	Thanks for talking to me.
3214	3218	Even as a kid, l went for the wrong women. l think that's my problem.
3218	3221	When my mother took me to see Snow White...
3221	3225	everyone fell in love with Snow White, and l fell for the wicked queen.
3225	3229	- We never have any fun anymore. - How can you say that?
3229	3231	Why not? You're always leaning on me to improve myself.
3231	3234	You're upset. You must be getting your period.
3234	3238	l don't get a period. l'm a cartoon character. Can't l be upset sometimes?
3238	3242	Max, forget about Annie. l know lots of women you can date.
3242	3244	l don't want to go out with other women.
3245	3248	Max, l've got a girl for you. You are going to love her. She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.
3250	3252	There are more people here to see the Maharishi...
3252	3255	than there were to see the Dylan concert.
3255	3258	l covered the Dylan concert, which gave me chills.
3258	3264	Especially when he sang, "She takes just like a woman...
3264	3267	and she makes love just like a woman.
3267	3269	Yes, she does.
3269	3272	And she aches just like a woman...
3272	3275	but she breaks just like a little girl."
3275	3278	Up to that, the most charismatic event l covered...
3278	3281	was Mick's birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden.
3281	3283	That's just great.
3283	3285	You catch Dylan?
3285	3288	No, l couldn't make it. My raccoon had hepatitis.
3288	3290	You have a raccoon?
3290	3292	A few.
3292	3295	The only word for this is "transplendent."
3295	3299	- lt's transplendent. - l can think of another word.
3299	3301	He's God. l mean, this man is God.
3301	3304	He's got millions of followers, who would crawl across the world...
3304	3306	just to touch the hem of his garment.
3306	3308	lt must be a tremendous hem.
3308	3311	- l'm a Rosicrucian myself. - Are you?
3311	3315	l can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.
3316	3318	There's God coming out of the men's room.
3318	3321	lt's unbelievably transplendent!
3321	3324	l was at the Stones' concert when they killed that guy. Remember?
3324	3327	Were you? l was at an Alice Cooper thing...
3327	3330	where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
3331	3334	l hope you don't mind that l took so long to finish.
3334	3337	Me? No. Don't be silly.
3339	3343	l'm starting to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
3344	3347	Sex with you is really a Kafkaesque experience.
3349	3350	Thank you.
3350	3353	l mean that as a compliment.
3353	3357	l think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm...
3357	3361	to make up for empty areas in life.
3363	3364	Who said that?
3367	3370	l don't know. l think it may have been Leopold and Loeb.
3375	3377	Hello.
3382	3385	No. What's the matter?
3386	3389	You sound terrible.
3389	3392	No, what-- Sure, l--
3392	3394	What kind of emergency?
3394	3398	No, stay there. l'll come over right now.
3398	3400	Just stay there. l'll come right over.
3400	3403	lt's me. Open up. Are you okay?
3403	3405	What's the matter? Are you all right?
3405	3408	There's a spider in the bathroom.
3408	3412	- What? - There's a big spider in the bathroom.
3413	3417	You got me here at 3:00 a.m. 'cause a spider's in the bathroom?
3417	3422	You know how l am about insects. l can't sleep with that thing crawling around.
3422	3424	Kill it! What's wrong with you?
3424	3427	Don't you have Raid in the house?
3428	3432	l told you a thousand times to keep a lot of insect spray.
3432	3435	- You never know who will crawl over. - l know.
3435	3437	And a first aid kit and fire extinguisher.
3437	3440	Give me a magazine, 'cause l'm a little tired.
3440	3443	You make fun of me, but l'm prepared for anything.
3443	3446	An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake.
3447	3450	What is this? Did you go to a rock concert?
3450	3452	Yeah.
3452	3455	Really? How'd you like it?
3455	3460	Was it heavy? Did it achieve total "heavyosity"?
3460	3462	lt was just great!
3462	3465	l've got an idea. Call the guy who took you to the rock concert...
3465	3468	and he can come and kill the spider.
3468	3471	l called you. You want to help me or not?
3471	3474	Since when do you read the National Review? What are you turning into?
3475	3478	l like to get all points of view.
3478	3481	Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley to kill the spider.
3481	3484	You're a little hostile, you know that?
3484	3487	Not only that, you look thin and tired.
3487	3490	lt's 3:00 in the morning. You got me out of bed.
3490	3493	l ran over. l couldn't get a taxi. You said it was an emergency.
3493	3495	l ran up the stairs.
3495	3499	l was more attractive when the evening began.
3499	3502	Are you going with a right-wing rock-and-roll star?
3502	3505	Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
3505	3509	- What am l, your son? l came over for-- - l've got the good chocolate.
3510	3513	- Where's the spider? - lt's in the bathroom.
3513	3517	Don't squish it. After it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay?
3517	3520	l've been killing spiders since l was 30. Okay?
3525	3528	lt's a very big spider. A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.
3528	3531	l didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider.
3531	3536	- You got a broom or snow shovel? - l left it at your house. l'm sorry.
3536	3538	What are you doing?
3538	3540	There's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
3548	3552	- You got black soap? - lt's for my complexion.
3552	3555	Are you joining a minstrel show?
3563	3565	Don't worry.
3574	3576	l did it. l killed them both. What's the matter?
3577	3581	What are you sad about? Did you want me to capture and rehabilitate 'em?
3581	3584	- Don't go, please. - What do you mean?
3584	3588	What's the matter? Are you expecting termites?
3588	3590	What's the matter?
3590	3593	l don't know. l miss you.
3593	3596	Jesus! Really?
3603	3605	- Alvy? - What?
3606	3610	Was there somebody in your room when l called you?
3611	3614	- What do you mean? - l mean, l thought l heard a voice.
3614	3618	l had the radio on. l'm sorry, it was the television.
3624	3629	Let's never break up again. l don't want to be apart.
3629	3634	l think we're both much too mature for something like that.
3634	3637	Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
3637	3640	For me it's been terrific. You know?
3640	3643	Better than either of my marriages.
3643	3647	There's something different about you. l don't know what, but it's great.
3647	3653	l think, if you let me, l could help you have more fun.
3653	3656	l know it's hard. Yeah.
3656	3660	What if we go away this weekend?
3660	3663	Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us would drive into Brooklyn?
3663	3666	We could show you the old neighborhood. That'd be fun for you.
3666	3668	Yeah, l'd love it.
3669	3671	God, it's a great day!
3671	3675	Watch the road! You'll total the car!
3675	3677	l've never been to Brooklyn.
3678	3680	- l can't wait to see the neighborhood. - The neighborhood will be great.
3680	3683	- We could show her the schoolyard. - l was a great athlete. Tell her.
3683	3686	l was all-schoolyard.
3686	3689	They threw him a football once. He tried to dribble it.
3689	3691	l used to lose my glasses a lot.
3691	3695	Look! That's my old house. That's where l used to live.
3695	3696	Holy cow!
3697	3701	You're lucky. Where l used to live is now a pornographic equipment store.
3701	3703	l had some very good memories there.
3703	3706	What good memories, your mother and father fighting all the time?
3706	3709	And over the most ridiculous things.
3709	3711	- You fired the cleaning woman? - She was stealing!
3711	3714	But she's colored. The colored have enough trouble!
3714	3717	- She was going through my purse. - They're persecuted enough.
3717	3721	- Who's persecuting? She stole! - So? We can afford it.
3721	3724	How can we afford it, on your pay? What if she steals more?
3724	3727	She's a colored woman from Harlem. She has no money.
3727	3731	She has a right to steal from us. Who can she steal from if not from us?
3731	3734	- You're both crazy. - They can't hear you.
3734	3737	Leo, l married a fool!
3737	3739	What's that?
3739	3744	That's the welcome home party, 1945, for my cousin Herbie.
3747	3750	Look. That over there is Joey Nichols.
3750	3753	He was my father's friend. He was always bothering me when l was a kid.
3753	3756	Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.
3756	3759	See? Nickels. You see? Nickels.
3759	3765	You can always remember my name. Just think of Joey Five-Cents.
3765	3769	That's me. Joey Five-Cents.
3769	3770	What an asshole.
3770	3774	The one who killed me the most was my mother's sister, Tessie.
3774	3776	l was always the sister with good common sense...
3776	3779	but Tessie was always the one with personality.
3779	3782	When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie.
3782	3785	Do you believe Tessie had the personality?
3785	3789	- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt. - She was once a great beauty.
3789	3792	Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
3792	3795	l was a great beauty!
3795	3799	- How did this personality come about? - l was very charming.
3799	3801	There were many men interested in you?
3801	3805	l was quite a lively dancer.
3805	3807	lt's very hard to believe.
3807	3812	l had a really good day. lt was a fine way to spend my birthday.
3812	3815	- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow. - But it's real close.
3816	3818	But no presents until midnight.
3822	3823	Happy birthday.
3823	3826	What is this? ls this a present? Are you kidding?
3826	3829	Yeah. Why don't you try it on?
3829	3834	- This is more like a present for you. - lt'll add ten years to our sex life.
3834	3836	Yeah. Forget it.
3836	3838	Here's a real present.
3838	3841	- What is this anyway? - Check it out.
3846	3850	You knew l wanted this. God, it's terrific!
3850	3853	Just put on the watch and that thing. lt'll be perfect.
3864	3868	Seems like
3868	3873	Old times
3874	3877	Having you
3878	3880	To walk with
3880	3883	Seems like
3887	3891	Old times
3893	3897	Having you to walk with
3899	3904	And it's still a thrill
3904	3909	Just to have my arms
3909	3912	Around you
3915	3919	Still the thrill
3919	3923	That it was the day
3923	3927	l found you
3927	3932	Seems like
3933	3937	Old times
3940	3945	Dinner dates and flowers
3948	3953	Old times
3955	3960	Staying up all hours
3960	3965	Making dreams come true
3967	3972	Doing things we used
3973	3976	To do
3978	3981	Seems like
3982	3985	Old times
3989	3994	Here with
3996	4001	You
4008	4010	Thank you.
4010	4012	You were sensational.
4012	4015	l told you if you stuck to it, you would be great and--
4015	4018	You were sensational.
4018	4021	Yeah, they were a terrific audience.
4021	4025	lt makes it easy for me, because l can be--
4025	4028	Excuse me. Hi, l'm Tony Lacey.
4028	4033	- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set. - Yeah? Really?
4033	4036	l thought it was very musical. l liked it a lot.
4036	4038	That's really nice. Thanks a lot.
4038	4042	Are you recording? Are you with any label?
4042	4046	Me? No, not at all.
4046	4050	l'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance.
4050	4053	Possibly working together.
4053	4058	That's nice. This is Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy?
4058	4062	l don't, but l know your work. l'm a big fan of yours.
4063	4067	This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.
4069	4072	We're going back to the Pierre...
4072	4075	and we're going to meet Jack and Angelica for a drink.
4076	4079	lf you'd like to come, we'd love to have you.
4079	4082	We can sit and talk. Not a big deal.
4082	4085	Just relax, be very mellow.
4085	4088	Remember we had that thing?
4088	4089	What thing?
4090	4093	Remember we discussed that thing?
4096	4100	Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing. Yeah.
4100	4105	Well, if it's inconvenient, that's fine, too.
4105	4109	We'll do it another time. lf you're on the coast, we'll get together there.
4110	4112	lt was a wonderful set. l really enjoyed it.
4112	4115	Nice to have met you. Good night.
4121	4124	What's the matter? You want to go to that party?
4124	4126	l don't know. l thought it might be fun.
4126	4129	lt would be nice to meet some new people.
4130	4135	l don't think l could take a mellow evening. l don't respond well to mellow.
4135	4138	lf l get too mellow, l ripen and rot.
4139	4142	- lt's not good for my-- - All right.
4142	4145	You don't want to go to the party. What do you want to do?
4152	4156	That day in Brooklyn was the last day l remember having a good time.
4156	4160	- We never have any laughs anymore. - l've been moody and dissatisfied.
4160	4163	- How often do you sleep together? - Do you have sex often?
4163	4166	Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
4166	4170	Constantly. l'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.
4170	4172	She would not sleep with me the other night.
4172	4176	l don't know. Six months ago l would have done it just to please him.
4176	4178	l tried everything.
4178	4182	l put on soft music and my red light bulb.
4182	4187	Since our discussions here, l feel l have a right to my own feelings.
4187	4191	l think you would have been happy, because l really asserted myself.
4191	4193	The incredible thing is, l'm paying for her analysis...
4193	4196	she's making progress, and l'm getting screwed.
4196	4201	l feel so guilty, because Alvy is paying for it.
4201	4203	So l feel guilty if l don't sleep with him.
4203	4207	But if l do sleep with him, it's like l'm going against my own feelings.
4207	4211	- l'm not making any progress. - l can't win.
4211	4213	Sometimes l think l should live with a woman.
4213	4218	l don't believe it. You guys have never snorted coke?
4218	4222	l always wanted to try, but Alvy's very down on it.
4222	4226	Don't put it on me. l don't want to put a wad of white powder in my nose.
4226	4228	There's the nasal membrane.
4228	4231	- You never want to try anything new. - How can you say that?
4231	4236	l said you, l and that girl from acting class should sleep together.
4236	4239	- That's sick. - l know it's sick, but it's new.
4239	4242	- You didn't say it couldn't be sick. - Come on, Alvy.
4243	4246	- Do your body a favor. Try it. - lt'll be fun.
4246	4250	l'm sure it's fun, 'cause the lncas did it. They were a million laughs.
4250	4253	For your own experience. You want to write. Why not?
4253	4257	lt's great stuff, Alvy. A friend just brought it in from California.
4257	4260	l didn't tell you. We're going to California next week.
4260	4263	lt's really a thrill, as you know.
4263	4268	On my agent's advice, l sold out and am going to do a TV appearance.
4268	4270	That's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on TV.
4270	4273	You act like you're violating a moral issue.
4273	4277	lt's so phony. We have to leave New York during Christmas. lt kills me.
4277	4283	Listen, while you're in California, could you score some coke for me?
4283	4288	Sure, be glad to. l'll just put it in the hollow heel on my boot.
4288	4292	- How much is this stuff? - About $2,000 an ounce.
4293	4295	Really? And what is the kick of it?
4306	4310	l've never been so relaxed as l have been since l moved out here.
4310	4314	l want you to see my house. l live next to Hugh Hefner.
4314	4318	And the women are like in Playboy, but they can move their arms and legs.
4318	4322	l can't get over that this is really Beverly Hills.
4322	4325	The architecture is really consistent. There's French next to Spanish...
4325	4328	next to Tudor next to Japanese.
4328	4330	lt's so clean out here.
4330	4334	Because they don't throw garbage away. They make it into TV shows.
4334	4338	- Give us a break. lt's Christmas. - Can you believe this is Christmas?
4338	4342	lt was snowing and really gray in New York.
4342	4345	Nice. Santa Claus will have sun stroke.
4345	4348	Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
4348	4350	There's no economic crime...
4350	4353	but there's ritual, religious cult murders.
4354	4356	There's wheat-germ killers out here.
4356	4358	While you're out here, l want you to see my TV show.
4358	4361	And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
4372	4376	Charlie, give me a good laugh here.
4378	4380	A little bigger.
4381	4383	Do you realize how immoral this all is?
4383	4385	l've got a hit series.
4385	4387	But you're adding fake laughs.
4390	4393	Give me a tremendous laugh here.
4393	4395	We do the show live in front of an audience.
4395	4397	But nobody laughs, because the jokes aren't funny.
4397	4400	That's why this machine is dynamite.
4404	4407	Give me a medium chuckle here...
4407	4410	and then a big hand.
4410	4413	ls there booing on that?
4413	4416	l don't feel well.
4416	4419	- What's the matter? - l got very dizzy.
4419	4422	- l feel dizzy. - Sit down.
4422	4423	Jesus.
4424	4427	You all right? You want to lie down?
4427	4430	No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.
4430	4432	How about a ginger ale?
4432	4435	No. Maybe l'd better lie down.
4435	4439	Try to get some of this down. lt's just plain chicken.
4441	4444	No, l can't eat this. l'm nauseous.
4446	4450	lf you could get me something to get me through the next two hours.
4450	4454	l have to go to Burbank and give out an award on a TV show.
4454	4456	There's nothing wrong with you as far as l can tell.
4456	4460	You have no fever, no symptoms of anything serious.
4460	4464	- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish. - Excuse me. l'm sorry, Doctor.
4464	4468	Alvy, that was the show. Everything is fine. They found a replacement.
4468	4470	They're going to tape without you.
4470	4473	Jesus! Now l don't get to do the TV show?
4474	4477	- l can't find any reason for this. - Nothing at all?
4477	4481	- l could get a lab man up here. - Hand me the salt, please.
4481	4485	Perhaps it would be better if we took him to the hospital.
4485	4487	The hospital?
4487	4490	- There's no other way to diagnose him. - This is not bad, actually.
4496	4499	Don't tell me we're going to have to walk from the car to the house?
4499	4502	My feet haven't touched pavement since l reached Los Angeles.
4502	4506	l'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
4506	4508	l took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.
4508	4511	- You take a meeting with him. - All the good meetings are taken.
4511	4513	Right now it's only a notion.
4513	4517	l think l can get money to make it into a concept, then turn it into an idea.
4518	4520	Like this house, Max?
4520	4522	Even wrote a road map to get us to the bathroom.
4523	4525	You should have told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
4525	4526	What difference does that make?
4526	4528	l think he has a thing for Annie.
4528	4532	- No. He goes with that girl over there. - Where?
4533	4536	- The one with the VPL. - VPL?
4536	4539	Visible panty line. She's gorgeous.
4539	4542	She's a ten. That's great for you, 'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?
4542	4544	There are no two's.
4544	4546	You're used to the kind with shopping bags walking through Central Park...
4546	4549	with the surgical masks on, muttering.
4549	4552	How do you like this couple? They look like they're from Masters and Johnson.
4552	4556	lntensive care ward. My God!
4556	4560	- l think she's giving me the eye. - lf she comes over, my brain will mush.
4561	4564	You're Alvy Singer, right? Didn't we meet at EST?
4564	4566	No, l was never to EST.
4566	4569	- Then how can you criticize it? - He didn't say anything.
4569	4573	l came to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis.
4574	4576	- He's my food taster. Have you two met? - How do you do?
4576	4580	- Do you taste for poisoned food? - Yeah, he's great.
4580	4582	You guys are wearing white. lt must be in the stars.
4582	4586	- Uri Geller must be on the premises. - We're going to operate together.
4586	4591	ln about six weeks we could cut the whole album.
4591	4594	l don't know. This is strange to me.
4594	4597	You can stay here. Use the whole wing in this house.
4597	4601	- Stay here? - Really. Why are you smiling?
4601	4605	Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good leading.
4605	4609	This is a great house: saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.
4609	4614	You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.
4614	4617	- Then you know who lived here? - Trigger.
4617	4621	Charlie Chaplin, right before his un-American thing.
4622	4626	- But you guys are still New Yorkers. - Yeah, l love it there.
4626	4631	l used to live there for years, but it's so dirty now.
4632	4636	- l'm into garbage. lt's my thing. - This is a nice screening room.
4636	4638	There's another thing about New York.
4638	4640	lf you want to see a movie, you have to stand on line.
4640	4643	lt could be freezing or raining. And here--
4643	4645	We saw Grand lllusion here last night.
4645	4648	That's a great film if you're high. lt's really funny.
4648	4652	Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic thing up there.
4652	4654	l'm cool.
4654	4657	lt's wonderful. They eat and watch movies all day.
4657	4661	And gradually you get old and die. lt's important to make an effort sometimes.
4662	4664	- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty? - She's great looking.
4664	4667	A little on the androgynous side.
4667	4669	l forgot my mantra.
4688	4690	That was fun.
4690	4693	l don't think California is bad at all.
4694	4696	lt's a drag coming home.
4696	4700	A lot of beautiful women. lt was fun to flirt.
4700	4702	l have to face facts.
4702	4707	l adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
4707	4711	l'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.
4711	4713	Why do l need this?
4713	4718	lf only l had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
4718	4721	lf only l didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.
4721	4725	lt'd probably wreck her, but l should be honest.
4725	4728	Alvy, let's face it.
4728	4731	l don't think our relationship is working.
4731	4734	l know. A relationship is like a shark:
4735	4738	lt has to constantly move forward or it dies.
4738	4742	And l think what we've got on our hands is a dead shark.
4742	4745	- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this? - lf it has my name on it...
4745	4747	l guess it's mine.
4747	4753	You wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day would come.
4753	4756	You wanted to break up just as much as l do.
4756	4760	No question. l think we're doing the mature thing.
4760	4764	Look. All the books on death and dying are yours.
4764	4766	And all the poetry books are mine.
4766	4770	Denial of Death. This is the first book l got you.
4770	4772	Remember that day?
4772	4774	l feel like there's a great weight off my back.
4776	4778	Thanks, honey.
4778	4783	l mean, no. l think it's important for us to explore new relationships.
4784	4789	There's no question about that, because we've given this a more than fair shot.
4789	4791	My analyst thinks this move is key for me.
4791	4795	And l trust her, because my analyst recommended her.
4795	4799	Why should l put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
4799	4802	You know what the beauty part is? We can always come back together again.
4802	4804	- There's no problem. - Exactly.
4804	4809	l don't think many couples could handle this, break up and remain friends.
4809	4812	This button is mine. Remember?
4812	4816	These are yours. "lmpeach Eisenhower." "lmpeach Nixon."
4816	4819	"lmpeach Lyndon Johnson." "lmpeach Ronald Reagan."
4821	4824	l miss Annie. l made a terrible mistake.
4824	4827	She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey.
4827	4831	lf she is, then the hell with her. lf she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.
4831	4834	- He's a jerk for one thing. - He graduated Harvard.
4834	4838	Harvard makes mistakes, too. Kissinger taught there.
4839	4841	Don't tell me you're jealous?
4841	4844	Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.
4844	4847	Can l show you something? l found this in the apartment.
4847	4852	Black soap. She used to wash her face 800 times a day with black soap.
4852	4854	Don't ask me why.
4854	4857	Why don't you go out with other women?
4857	4860	l tried, but it's very depressing.
4860	4863	This always happens to me. Quick! Get a broom!
4863	4866	What are you making such a big deal about?
4866	4869	They're only lobsters.
4869	4873	-You're adult. You can pick up lobsters. -l'm not myself since l quit smoking.
4873	4876	- When did you quit? - Sixteen years ago.
4876	4879	- What do you mean? - Mean?
4880	4883	You stopped smoking 16 years ago. ls that what you said?
4885	4887	l don't understand.
4887	4890	Are you joking or what?
4901	4903	Central Park's turning green.
4903	4908	l saw that lunatic we used to see with the pinwheel hat...
4908	4911	and the roller-skates.
4911	4914	Listen, l want you to come back here.
4914	4918	Well, then l'm going to come out there and get you.
4922	4924	What do you mean, where am l? Where do you think l am?
4924	4929	l'm at the Los Angeles airport. l flew in.
4929	4932	l flew in to see you.
4932	4935	Can we not debate this on the telephone...
4935	4938	because l've got a temperature...
4938	4942	and l'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea again.
4942	4944	Wherever you want to meet. l don't care.
4944	4946	l'll drive in. l rented a car.
4948	4950	l'm driving.
4950	4953	What, is that such a miracle? l'm driving myself.
4969	4972	l'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...
4972	4975	and a plate of mashed yeast.
4995	4997	You look pretty.
4997	5000	No, l just lost a little weight, that's all.
5005	5008	Well, you look nice.
5008	5012	l think we should get married.
5012	5013	Come on.
5015	5019	Why, you want to live out here? lt's like living in Munchkinland.
5019	5023	What do you mean? lt's perfectly fine out here.
5023	5027	Tony's very nice.
5027	5030	l meet people, go to parties and play tennis.
5030	5033	That's a very big step for me.
5033	5036	l'm able to enjoy people more.
5036	5039	You're not going to come back to New York?
5039	5043	What's so great about New York? lt's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.
5043	5046	You didn't read Death in Venice until l bought it for you.
5047	5050	That's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the title.
5050	5052	Because it's an important issue.
5052	5055	You're incapable of enjoying life. You know that?
5056	5058	You're like New York City. You're just this person.
5058	5061	You're like this island unto yourself.
5061	5064	l can't enjoy anything unless everybody is.
5064	5068	lf one guy is starving someplace, it puts a crimp in my evening.
5071	5073	Do you want to get married?
5075	5078	No. We're friends.
5078	5081	l want to remain friends.
5083	5084	Check please.
5084	5087	You're mad, aren't you?
5087	5090	Yes, of course l'm mad, because you love me. l know that.
5090	5093	l can't say that that's true at this point in my life.
5093	5096	l really can't say that's true.
5096	5099	You know how wonderful you are.
5099	5102	You're the reason l got out of my room, that l was able to sing...
5103	5107	and get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap.
5107	5109	Listen, listen.
5111	5112	So what are you up to?
5115	5119	The usual. l'm trying to write. l'm working on a play.
5121	5123	Are you saying you're not coming back to New York with me?
5124	5129	No. Look. l gotta go.
5129	5133	What do you mean? l flew 3,000 miles to see you.
5133	5135	Air miles. Do you know what that does to my stomach?
5136	5138	lf you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony.
5138	5140	- The Grammys are tonight. - The what?
5140	5142	The Grammys. He's got a lot of records up for awards.
5142	5145	They give awards for that music? l thought just ear plugs.
5145	5148	Just forget it. Let's just forget the conversation.
5148	5151	They do nothing but give out awards. l can't believe it.
5151	5155	Greatest Fascist Dictator: Adolph Hitler.
5185	5188	l know what you're going to say. l'm not a great driver.
5188	5191	- l have some problems with-- - May l see your license, please?
5191	5194	Just don't get angry.
5194	5198	l have my license here. lt's a rented car.
5200	5203	Don't give me your life's story.
5203	5205	Just pick up the license.
5205	5209	You have to ask nicely, because l've had a rough day. My girlfriend--
5209	5212	Just give me the license, please.
5213	5216	Since you put it that way, it's hard for me to refuse.
5216	5219	l have a terrific problem with authority.
5220	5222	lt's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
5230	5233	So long, fellows. Keep in touch.
5242	5246	lmagine my surprise when l got your call.
5246	5249	Yeah. l had the feeling l got you at a bad moment.
5249	5252	l heard high-pitched squealing.
5252	5253	Twins, Max.
5254	5256	Sixteen-year-olds.
5258	5261	Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that?
5262	5265	You're an actor. You should be doing Shakespeare in the park.
5265	5268	l did Shakespeare in the park. l got mugged.
5268	5272	l was playing Richard ll. Two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
5277	5281	Are we driving through plutonium?
5281	5284	Keeps out the alpha rays. You don't get old.
5287	5290	You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
5290	5293	What is so great about New York?
5293	5296	lt's a dying city. You read Death in Venice.
5296	5298	You didn't read Death in Venice until l gave it to you.
5299	5301	You only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
5301	5305	- lt's an important issue. - You're incapable of enjoying life.
5305	5308	You're like New York. You're an island.
5308	5312	Okay. lf that's all that we've been through together means to you...
5312	5315	it's better if we just said good-bye, once and for all.
5315	5317	lt's funny.
5317	5320	After all the serious talks and passionate moments...
5320	5323	that it ends here, in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.
5324	5326	Good-bye, Sally.
5326	5331	Wait. l'm going to go with you.
5331	5333	l love you.
5336	5339	What do you want? lt was my first play.
5339	5342	You know how you're always trying to get things to come out perfect in art...
5342	5346	because it's real difficult in life.
5346	5350	lnterestingly, however, l did run into Annie again.
5350	5352	lt was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
5352	5356	She had moved back to New York. She was living in Soho with some guy.
5356	5360	When l met her, she was dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...
5360	5363	which l counted as a personal triumph.
5363	5366	Annie and l had lunch sometime after that...
5366	5370	and just kicked around old times.
5370	5374	Just to have my arms
5376	5378	Around you
5382	5385	Still the thrill
5386	5389	That it was the day
5389	5392	l found you
5393	5396	Seems like
5398	5403	Old times
5405	5411	Dinner dates and flowers
5414	5416	Old times
5417	5420	After that, it got late and we both had to go.
5420	5422	But it was great seeing Annie again.
5422	5425	l realize what a terrific person she was...
5425	5428	and how much fun it was just knowing her.
5428	5432	And l thought of that old joke.
5432	5437	This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.
5437	5439	He thinks he's a chicken."
5439	5442	The doctor says, "Why don't you turn him in?"
5442	5445	The guy says, "l would, but l need the eggs."
5445	5449	Well, l guess that's, now, how l feel about relationships.
5450	5455	They're totally irrational, crazy and absurd.
5455	5458	But l guess we keep going through it...
5458	5461	because most of us need the eggs.
