63	66	Hunger strike? How long has this been going on?
66	68	She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today.
68	70	-Sending meals up to her regularly? -Yes, sir.
70	72	Why don't you jam it down her throat?
72	74	It's not that simple, Mr. Andrews.
74	78	I'll talk to her myself. Have some food brought up to her.
78	81	Yes, sir.
81	83	I won't eat a thing until you let me off this boat.
83	86	Come now, Ellie. You know I'lI have my way.
86	89	Not this time, you won't! I'm already married to him.
89	92	You'll never live under the same roof with him.
92	93	I'lI see to it.
93	96	Get it through your head, King Westley and I are married!
96	99	Definitely, legally, actually married! It's over, it's finished.
99	103	There's not a thing you can do about it. I'm over 21 and so is he.
103	104	While you've been onboard...
104	107	...I've arranged to have your marriage annulled.
107	111	Annulled. I'lI have something to say about that and so will King.
111	114	I expect him to.
114	116	The vittles. Come in.
116	119	I told you not to bring any food in here.
119	121	Now wait a minute. This isn't for you.
121	131	Put it down here.
131	134	Smart, aren't you? So subtle.
134	135	Strategy, my dear.
135	138	Was it strategy sending those gorillas to drag me away...
138	140	...from the Justice of the Peace?
140	142	Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
142	153	I've won many arguments that way.
153	155	You're always telling me what not to do.
155	158	Because you've always been a stubborn idiot.
158	160	I come from a long line of stubborn idiots.
160	163	Don't shout so. You may work up an appetite.
163	166	I'll shout if I want to! I'll scream if I want to!
166	167	All right, scream.
167	170	Let me off this boat or I'll break every piece of furniture in here!
170	172	Here, now.
172	175	Have a nice piece of juicy steak. You don't have to eat it.
175	195	Just smell it. It's a poem.
195	198	Lower the boats! Catch her!
198	205	Come on, men!
205	206	She got away, sir.
206	208	Of course, she's too smart for you.
208	211	Send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency.
211	212	"Daughter escaped again.
212	217	"Watch roads, airports and train stations in Miami."
217	221	All aboard! Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...
221	251	...New York, Philadelphia.
251	255	-What? -There's a man biting a dog in there.
255	258	Heel, boy.
258	260	I can't stand this any longer.
260	263	In a pig's eye, you will.
263	267	Listen monkey face, when you fired me, you fired the best news hound...
267	269	...your filthy scandal sheet ever had.
269	273	You wouldn't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants.
273	277	I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were gonna write it in Greek?
277	278	I'd start a new department.
278	281	That was free verse, you gas house palooka.
281	284	What was free about it? lt cost this paper a gob of dough.
284	286	And it's not going to cost us any more!
286	287	Gordon.
287	289	Did you know he reversed the charge?
289	291	What? Why you....
291	296	When you get back to New York, you keep far away from this office.
296	301	You're fired. You don't work here anymore and you never will.
301	306	What'd he say?
306	310	So, you're changing your tune?
310	312	You're late with your apologies.
312	316	I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees!
316	320	I hope this'll be a lesson to you.
320	322	Did we tell that baby?
322	326	-We don't need anymore of his lip. -You told him, Pete.
326	328	I guess he knows now, how I feel about his job.
328	330	I bet he does, too.
330	332	ls my chariot ready?
332	336	Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, mighty King.
336	339	-Lead on, sire. -Make way for the king.
339	341	Make way for the king.
341	350	Long live the king.
350	355	Philadelphia, all aboard!
355	356	Step down Marty, King is back.
356	362	On the rack in the back. It's your goodbye chariot.
362	364	Make hams of you and scram !
364	366	Two thousand miles is a long trip.
366	369	Make yourseIf comfortable with a pleasant pillow.
369	379	Pillow, sir?
379	393	Driver! If you'll be good enough to move those newspapers, I'lI have a seat.
393	398	Hey, wait a minute!
398	400	What do you think you're doing?
400	403	The papers. What's the idea of throwing them out?
403	406	The papers? It's a long story, my friend.
406	409	I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers.
409	412	I did it once, and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
412	416	lt actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day.
416	420	They followed me all over town and read the news off the seat of my pants.
420	426	A fresh guy. What you need is a good sock on the nose.
426	431	Listen partner, you may not like my nose, but I do.
431	433	I always wear it out in the open so...
433	436	...if anybody wants to take a sock at it, they can.
436	440	Yeah?
440	443	Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it?
443	446	Our conversation could have been over long ago.
446	447	Yeah?
447	450	If you keep that up, we won't get anywhere.
450	453	Yeah?
453	464	You got me. Yeah!
464	469	Excuse me, lady. But that upon which you sit is mine.
469	471	I beg your pardon?
471	474	Now listen, I put up a stiff fight for that seat.
474	478	So, if it's just the same to you, scram.
478	480	Driver, are these seats reserved?
480	484	-No. First come, first serve. -Thank you.
484	487	These seats accommodate two people, don't they?
487	489	Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
489	493	Thank you.
493	496	Move over.
496	506	This is a "maybe they do."
506	528	If you'd ask me real nice, I might put that bag up there for you.
528	551	Next time you drop in, bring your folks.
551	554	Get some! Come on, everybody!
554	559	Hot dogs, folks!
559	563	Rest station, 1 5 minutes. We'll only be here 1 5 minutes.
563	565	Red hot coffee!
565	567	Right around there.
567	569	Get the red hot coffee! Hot dogs!
569	614	Can't enjoy the ride unless you eat!
614	616	He got away.
616	619	I found myseIf in the middle of brush and no sign of the skunk.
619	621	I don't know what you're raving about, young man.
621	626	-Furthermore, I'm not interested. -Well of all the....
626	629	Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag is gone.
629	631	My heavens! It's gone!
631	634	I knew you'd catch on eventually.
634	638	-What am I going to do now? -Don't tell me your ticket was in it.
638	642	No, got that all right. But not my money. All I have here is $4.
642	645	You can wire home for money in Jacksonville.
645	646	No, I can't.
646	650	-Yes, I guess I will. -I'll tell the driver about your bag.
650	652	Thank you, I'd rather you didn't.
652	655	Don't be a fool. You've lost your bag. The company should pay for it.
655	658	-What's your name? -I don't want it reported!
658	661	That's silly. The company will take care of it.
661	665	Can you understand English? Would you please keep out of my affairs?
665	670	I want to be left alone.
670	673	Why, you ungrateful brat.
673	675	Board!
675	779	All aboard!
779	781	Jacksonville, 30 minutes for breakfast.
781	784	Only 30 minutes for breakfast.
784	787	Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.
787	815	Read all about it!
815	818	I'm so sorry.
818	821	Silly, isn't it?
821	827	Why, everybody's gone!
827	830	Thank you for that, very much.
830	836	-We're in Jacksonville, aren't we? -Yes.
836	839	That was foolish of me.
839	842	Why didn't you shove me away?
842	847	I hated to wake you up. You look kind of pretty asleep.
847	849	How about some breakfast?
849	854	No thank you. No, I'm going to the Windsor Hotel.
854	858	Windsor? You'll never make it in time. We leave in a haIf an hour.
858	863	No, they'll wait for me.
863	867	Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late. Be sure to wait for me.
867	869	Yeah?
869	892	Yes.
892	894	Where's the bus to New York?
894	896	lt left about 20 minutes ago.
896	900	But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus. I told them to wait.
900	903	I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.
903	909	Good morning. Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
909	912	Seems to me, I've already thanked you for that.
912	913	What time's the next bus?
913	915	8:00 tonight.
915	918	8:00? That's 1 2 hours.
918	921	Sorry, miss.
921	924	What's wrong? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?
924	926	Why are you so excited? You missed it, too.
926	929	Yeah, I missed it too.
929	933	Don't tell me you did it on my account.
933	937	I hope you haven't any idea that what happened last night is....
937	940	Young man, you needn't concern yourseIf about me.
940	942	I can take care of myself.
942	946	You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket.
946	947	My ticket?
947	953	I found it on the seat.
953	959	Thank you. lt must have fallen out of my purse.
959	963	You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
963	966	-What are you talking about? -You won't get away with it.
966	970	Your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York.
970	972	You must have me confused with someone else.
972	981	Quit kidding. It's all over the front page.
981	983	I've always been curious to know...
983	987	...what kind of a girl would marry a front-page aviator like King Westley.
987	993	Take my advice. Grab the next bus back to Miami. That guy's a phoney.
993	996	I didn't ask for your advice.
996	999	That's right. You didn't.
999	1001	You're not going to notify my father, are you?
1001	1004	What for?
1004	1006	You probably could get some money out of him.
1006	1008	I never thought of that.
1008	1012	If you promise not to do it, I'll pay you as much as he will.
1012	1014	You won't gain a thing by giving me up.
1014	1016	I'm willing to make it worth your while.
1016	1018	I've got to get to New York without being stopped.
1018	1020	It's very important to me.
1020	1022	I'd pay you now, only...
1022	1025	...all I had when I jumped off the yacht was a watch.
1025	1027	I had to pawn it to get these clothes.
1027	1030	I'll give you my address. You can contact me in New York.
1030	1032	Never mind.
1032	1035	I had you pegged right from the jump.
1035	1039	Just the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you get anything is to buy it.
1039	1044	You're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. lt never fails, does it?
1044	1046	Ever hear of the word "humility"?
1046	1048	No, you wouldn't.
1048	1049	lt never occurred to you to say...
1049	1052	..."Please, Mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?"
1052	1055	That'd bring you down off your high horse.
1055	1057	I'll tell you something to ease your mind.
1057	1059	You don't have to worry about me.
1059	1062	I'm not interested in your money or your problem.
1062	1072	You, King Westley, your father. You're all a lot of hooey to me.
1072	1074	You send telegrams here?
1074	1081	I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you?
1081	1084	"To Joe Gordon, in care of New York Mail, New York.
1084	1089	"Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap.
1089	1093	"I know where Ellen Andrews is." No, do you really?
1093	1095	Go on. Send the telegram.
1095	1100	"How would you like to have the story? You big tub of...."
1100	1102	Mush.
1102	1104	"Tub of mush. Well, try and get it.
1104	1108	"What I said about never writing another line for you still goes.
1108	1110	"Are you burning? Peter Warne."
1110	1112	That'll be $2.60.
1112	1114	-Send it collect. -Collect?
1114	1121	Collect.
1121	1126	Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston, Columbia, Greensboro, Richmond...
1126	1157	...Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York....
1157	1162	Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley. May as well get acquainted, it's a long trip.
1162	1165	Gets tiresome. Especially for somebody like you.
1165	1167	You look like you've got class.
1167	1171	Yes, with a capital "K". I'm the guy that knows class when he sees it.
1171	1175	Believe you me. Ask any of the boys. They'll tell you.
1175	1178	Shapeley sure knows how to pick them.
1178	1181	Shapeley's the name and that's the way I like them.
1181	1182	You made no mistake sitting next to me.
1182	1184	Most girls you meet on the bus...
1184	1187	...ain't nothing to write home to the wife about.
1187	1190	You gotta be awful careful who you hit it up with.
1190	1192	You can't be too particular, neither.
1192	1195	What's the matter, you ain't saying much?
1195	1199	Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
1199	1204	That's pretty good. "Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance."
1204	1208	Well shut my big, nasty mouth.
1208	1210	Looks like you're one up on me.
1210	1213	There's nothing I like better than to meet a high-class mama...
1213	1217	...that can snap back at you. The colder they are, the hotter they get.
1217	1219	That's what I always say.
1219	1221	Yes, sir.
1221	1227	When a cold mama gets hot, boy how she sizzles.
1227	1229	Now you're just my type.
1229	1233	Believe me, sister, I could go for you in a big way.
1233	1238	"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley," they call me. With accent on the "fun". Believe you me.
1238	1243	Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
1243	1246	Looks like you're two up on me now.
1246	1249	Hey, you.
1249	1253	-There's a seat over there for you. -What's the idea?
1253	1256	I'd like to sit next to my wife, if you don't mind.
1256	1258	-Your wife? -Yes.
1258	1260	Come on.
1260	1264	Yeah. Sure, excuse me. You know, I was just....
1264	1268	Sure. Excuse me, miss. I was just trying to make things pleasant.
1268	1269	Excuse me, I....
1269	1274	I didn't mean anything, Doc.
1274	1282	-No offence, Doc. -No.
1282	1285	If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
1285	1296	Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice gets on my nerves.
1296	1299	What'd you do all day?
1299	1305	Ran in and out of doorways. Trying to keep out of the rain.
1305	1309	Your clothes are all wet.
1309	1312	Here.
1312	1314	You're as helpless as a baby.
1314	1315	Thank you.
1315	1320	Here you are, folks. Cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum, candy, magazines.
1320	1324	Here, boy.
1324	1326	-Yes, ma'am. -A box of chocolates, please.
1326	1329	-Never mind. She doesn't want it. -But....
1329	1332	-Of course, I do. What do you mean? -Beat it.
1332	1337	Well, you've got your nerve. Here, boy!
1337	1339	$1 .60.
1339	1342	You had $4 last night.
1342	1344	How will you get to New York at this rate?
1344	1347	That's none of your business.
1347	1350	You're on a budget from now on.
1350	1375	-Just a minute. You can't-- -Shut up.
1375	1378	-What's the matter, officer? -Bridge washed out.
1378	1380	Looks like we can't get through till morning.
1380	1383	If any passengers want a place to sleep...
1383	1385	...you'll find an auto camp up yonder a piece.
1385	1389	-Where? -Right over there. See those lights?
1389	1390	Dyke's Auto camp.
1390	1393	All right, thanks. Hey, brat.
1393	1395	Are you talking to me?
1395	1413	Yeah. Come on, we're stopping here for the night.
1413	1427	Hey! Come on, we're all set.
1427	1440	Good evening. Hope you and your husband rest comfortable.
1440	1464	Come on! What are you going to do, stay out there all night?
1464	1466	Darn clever, these Armenians?
1466	1470	Yeah, it's a gift.
1470	1475	I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
1475	1480	Yeah. I forgot to tell you about that. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
1480	1483	You did?
1483	1486	What am I expected to do? Leap for joy?
1486	1490	I kind of haIf expected you to thank me.
1490	1493	Your ego is absolutely colossal.
1493	1502	Yeah, it's not bad. How's yours?
1502	1508	You know, compared to you, my friend Shapeley's an amateur.
1508	1511	Just whatever gave you any idea I'd stand for this?
1511	1516	Now wait a minute. Let's get this straightened out right now.
1516	1519	If you're nursing any silly notion that I'm interested in you, forget it.
1519	1522	You're just a headline to me.
1522	1524	A headline?
1524	1527	You're not a newspaper man, are you?
1527	1530	Chalk up one for your side.
1530	1533	Now listen. You want to get to King Westley, don't you?
1533	1537	All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story.
1537	1543	Exclusive. A day-to-day account. All about your mad fight to happiness.
1543	1550	I need that story. Between you and me, I've got to have it.
1550	1554	lsn't that just too cute.
1554	1558	There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there?
1558	1562	You've got everything nicely figured out for yourself. lncluding this.
1562	1565	This? Well, that's a matter of simple mathematics.
1565	1570	These cabins cost $2 a night. I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear...
1570	1580	...but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishment.
1580	1584	Thank you very much, sir. You've been very kind.
1584	1587	It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm.
1587	1589	But I'm going to follow you.
1589	1590	Yeah.
1590	1595	And if you get tough, I'll just have to turn you over to your old man. Right now.
1595	1600	Savvy? That's my whole plot in a nutshell.
1600	1603	A simple story for simple people.
1603	1606	You behave yourself, I'lI see you get to King Westley.
1606	1610	If not, I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa.
1610	1615	Now, which of these beds do you prefer?
1615	1640	This one? All right.
1640	1644	That, I suppose, makes everything quite all right.
1644	1648	This?
1648	1652	I like privacy when I retire. Yes, I'm very delicate in that respect.
1652	1658	Prying eyes annoy me.
1658	1661	Behold the walls of Jericho.
1661	1664	Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet.
1664	1666	But a lot safer.
1666	1670	You see, I have no trumpet.
1670	1672	Now to show you my heart's in the right place...
1672	1677	...I'll give you my best pair of pyjamas.
1677	1680	Do you mind joining the lsraelites?
1680	1682	You don't want to join the lsraelites?
1682	1687	All right. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.
1687	1691	There's a funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology.
1691	1693	No two men do it alike.
1693	1697	I once knew a man who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed.
1697	1699	Now he made a picture.
1699	1704	Years later, his secret came out. He wore a toupee.
1704	1706	I have a method all my own.
1706	1711	If you'll notice, the coat came first. Then the tie. Then the shirt.
1711	1716	Now, according to Hoyle, after that the pants should be next.
1716	1718	There's where I'm different.
1718	1720	I go for the shoes next.
1720	1724	First the right. Then the left.
1724	1751	After that, it's every man for himself.
1751	1756	Still with me, brat?
1756	1759	Don't be a sucker.
1759	1762	A good night's rest will do you a lot of good.
1762	1764	Besides, you got nothing to worry about.
1764	1783	The walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf.
1783	1787	"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? The big bad wolf
1787	1788	"The big bad wolf
1788	1797	"She's afraid of the big bad wolf Tra, la, la, la, la"
1797	1799	Would you mind please, putting out the light?
1799	1841	No, not at all.
1841	1844	I wish you'd take those things off the walls of Jericho.
1844	1872	Excuse me.
1872	1876	By the way, what's your name?
1876	1877	What's that?
1877	1880	Who are you?
1880	1882	Who, me?
1882	1886	I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night.
1886	1890	I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
1890	1893	You've got a name, haven't you?
1893	1896	Yeah, I got a name. Peter Warne.
1896	1899	Peter Warne.
1899	1901	I don't like it.
1901	1907	Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
1907	1910	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.
1910	1933	The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.
1933	1936	-Another message, sir. -What is it? What is it?
1936	1939	It's from Charleston. "Checking every northbound train.
1939	1942	"Also assigned 20 operators to watch main highways.
1942	1944	"No sign of her yet. Will continue to do all possible.
1944	1947	"Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."
1947	1949	It's just the same as all the others.
1949	1952	-Yes, sir? -I said I was in a hurry to get to New York.
1952	1955	-What are we crawling for? -I got it wide open.
1955	1957	-All right, step on it. -Yes, sir.
1957	1959	I hope she's all right.
1959	1963	All right? Of course, she's all right. What could happen to her?
1963	1990	-Nothing, sir. -Then shut up about it.
1990	1994	Hello?
1994	2000	Hey, mister.
2000	2002	Hello.
2002	2004	What's the matter, you not up yet?
2004	2008	-What time is it? -8:00. Here.
2008	2011	It's a toothbrush, thanks.
2011	2014	My dress, you had it pressed.
2014	2017	Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.
2017	2019	You sweet thing. Where'd you get it pressed?
2019	2022	I'll count to 1 0. If you're not out of bed by then...
2022	2024	...I'll drag you out myself.
2024	2027	-One, two, three, four, five.... -I really think you would!
2027	2031	I'm out! I'm out!
2031	2036	You'll find the showers just behind the second cottage.
2036	2037	Outside?
2037	2042	All the best homes have them outside.
2042	2045	I can't go out like this.
2045	2048	-Like what? -Like this. I have no robe.
2048	2051	Here, use mine.
2051	2052	Thanks.
2052	2053	Make it snappy.
2053	2056	Wait, it's not my fault. You got the sleeve.
2056	2061	-Here are my puppets. -Thanks.
2061	2064	Where'd you say the showers were?
2064	2067	Here's a towel.
2067	2070	Thank you.
2070	2072	You're kind of little, aren't you?
2072	2074	Where's the shower?
2074	2076	Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
2076	2111	I'll find it myself.
2111	2113	Are the showers in there?
2113	2115	They ain't out here.
2115	2120	Thank you.
2120	2128	Can't a body have a little privacy around here?
2128	2142	You want a shower around here, you'll stand in line.
2142	2145	Hi, sister. You remember me, Shapeley?
2145	2147	Say, I'm sorry about last night.
2147	2160	Didn't know you was married to that guy. You should've told me right off.
2160	2162	High time you got back.
2162	2165	I met some very interesting women at the showers.
2165	2173	We got chatting about this and that. You know how time flies.
2173	2176	Come on. Sit down.
2176	2178	My, my. Scrambled eggs.
2178	2184	Egg. One egg. One donut, black coffee. That's your ration till lunch.
2184	2185	Any complaints?
2185	2187	No. No complaints.
2187	2190	I'd have cream for your coffee, but I'd be buying a whole pint.
2190	2192	You don't have to apologise to me.
2192	2195	You don't know how much I appreciate all this.
2195	2198	What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
2198	2199	Must be the spring.
2199	2202	I thought maybe "believe you me" told you some more snappy stories.
2202	2207	No. He apologised for last night. Said he didn't know we were married.
2207	2212	Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.
2212	2216	-Donut? -Thanks.
2216	2219	You think this whole business is silly?
2219	2220	Running away and all.
2220	2222	No. Makes too good a story.
2222	2226	Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat.
2226	2228	Perhaps I am. Although, I don't see how I can be.
2228	2231	Spoiled people are used to having their way.
2231	2232	I never have. On the contrary.
2232	2237	I've always been told what to do and how to do it and when and with whom.
2237	2241	Can you believe, this is the first time I've ever been alone with a man?
2241	2242	Yeah.
2242	2245	It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.
2245	2247	You're doing all right.
2247	2249	Thanks.
2249	2256	Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even bodyguards. It's been a lot of fun.
2256	2259	One consolation, you can never get lonesome.
2259	2264	lt has its moments. It's become a sort of game, trying to outwit father's detectives.
2264	2268	I did once. Actually went shopping without a bodyguard.
2268	2271	lt was swell. I felt absolutely immoral.
2271	2274	lt didn't last long, they found me in a department store.
2274	2278	I was so mad, I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw.
2278	2279	Guess who was in it?
2279	2281	Santa Claus?
2281	2282	Ghandi?
2282	2285	King Westley was in it.
2285	2288	-ls that how you met him? -Yes.
2288	2291	We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic.
2291	2296	By 6.00, he was having all the rivers dragged.
2296	2299	Where'd you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
2299	2301	Now don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
2301	2304	Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how.
2304	2308	Dunking is an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and sock, into your mouth.
2308	2311	You leave it in too long, it gets soft and falls off.
2311	2315	It's all a matter of timing. I'll write a book about it.
2315	2316	Thanks, professor.
2316	2320	Just goes to show you. $20 million, and you don't know how to dunk.
2320	2325	I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
2325	2327	How do I know who you are? I never saw you before.
2327	2332	You can't go around bothering my tenants. There's no girl by that name here.
2332	2334	How do I know you're detectives?
2334	2339	Show him your credentials, Mac.
2339	2341	Detectives.
2341	2344	That's father at work. Peter, what'll I do?
2344	2347	Maybe I can jump out of the window. They won't see me.
2347	2349	Get yourseIf all mussed up.
2349	2353	Get your hair down over your eyes and undo your buttons.
2353	2355	I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week.
2355	2359	She said if we don't stop over in Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us.
2359	2361	What are you talking about?
2361	2365	The baby's due next month. They want us to come.
2365	2372	She saw your sister on the street the other day. Said she's looking swell.
2372	2373	Come in.
2373	2376	I hope Aunt Bella has a boy, don't you?
2376	2381	Grandma says it's gonna be a girl. She hasn't missed calling one in years.
2381	2383	Man here to see you, sweetheart.
2383	2384	Who, me? You wanna see me?
2384	2386	What's your name?
2386	2390	-Are you addressing me? -Yeah. What's your name?
2390	2393	Wait a minute. That's my wife you're talking to.
2393	2395	What do you mean coming here? What do you want?
2395	2399	-We're looking for somebody. -Fine, but don't come busting in here.
2399	2400	This isn't a public park.
2400	2402	I got news to take a sock at you.
2402	2404	-Take it easy. -The men are detectives.
2404	2406	Even if they're the whole police department...
2406	2409	...they can't bust in here, questioning my wife.
2409	2412	Don't get so excited. He asked you a simple question.
2412	2416	ls that so? How many times have I told you not to butt in?
2416	2420	You don't have to lose your temper!
2420	2422	As usual. Every time I try to protect you.
2422	2425	At the elks dance, when that big Swede hit on you.
2425	2427	He did not! I told you a million times.
2427	2430	He kept pawing you all over the dance floor.
2430	2432	He didn't. You were drunk.
2432	2434	Nuts! Just like your old man.
2434	2437	Once a plumber's daughter, always a plumber's daughter.
2437	2439	There ain't an ounce of brains in your family.
2439	2441	Peter Warne, you've gone far enough!
2441	2444	-Shut up! -You see what you've done?
2444	2448	Sorry, but you see, we've gotta check up on everybody.
2448	2450	We're looking for a girl named Ellen Andrews.
2450	2452	Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul.
2452	2455	Too bad you're not looking for a plumber's daughter.
2455	2457	Quit bawling!
2457	2474	I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple.
2474	2476	You weren't bad, jumping in like that.
2476	2479	-You've got a brain. -You're not so bad, yourself.
2479	2481	We could start a two-people stock company.
2481	2484	Things get tough, we'll play to small town auditoriums.
2484	2486	We'll call this one, "The Great Deception."
2486	2488	What about "Cinderella" or a real hot love story?
2488	2490	No, too mushy.
2490	2492	I like mushy stuff.
2492	2495	Quit bawling!
2495	2496	Bus leaves in five minutes!
2496	2499	-What? -Your bus leaves in five minutes.
2499	2506	Holy smoke, we're not even packed yet.
2506	2509	I'm starting to think you couldn't find your way home.
2509	2510	This is the last session....
2510	2512	-Yeah? - Telegram for you.
2512	2515	-Bring it in. -Another wire from Peter Warne.
2515	2521	Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket. Wait a minute. What does it say?
2521	2524	"Have I got a story. Stop. It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop.
2524	2528	"Hope you're the same."
2528	2530	-Collect? -Yes.
2530	2532	-If you accept another one, you're fired. -Yes, sir.
2532	2535	And that gives me an idea for all of you.
2535	2537	I want action, Lovington, action.
2537	2540	-We can't do the impossible. -It isn't impossible.
2540	2543	She's somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found.
2543	2546	-I put extra men on, the whole way. -That's not enough.
2546	2547	Send in Clark and Brown.
2547	2550	-You sure she isn't with King Westley? -No.
2550	2553	He's being trailed 24 hours a day.
2553	2555	He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
2555	2559	I'm worried. After all, something might have happened to her.
2559	2560	I don't think so.
2560	2562	Brown, arrange a radio broadcast.
2562	2564	Coast-to-coast hook up. Offer a reward of...
2564	2567	...$1 0,000 for information on her whereabouts.
2567	2570	Clark, send the story to all of the newspapers.
2570	2572	Some out-of-town papers may not have a picture of her.
2572	2577	Wire this to them. I want the story to break right away.
2577	2614	Now we'll get some action!
2614	2616	Fine, that's fine.
2616	2622	You know that one about the man who flew on the trapeze?
2622	2628	Yeah.
2628	2632	"Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
2632	2637	"Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
2637	2641	"Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn
2641	2645	"Betrayed by a maid in her teens
2645	2649	"This maid that I loved she was handsome
2649	2653	"And I tried all I knew how to please
2653	2657	"But I never could please her one-quarter so well
2657	2661	"As the man on the flying trapeze
2661	2665	"He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
2665	2669	"The daring young man on the flying trapeze
2669	2673	"His actions are graceful, all the girls he does please
2673	2683	"And my love he has stolen away"
2683	2687	I know the second verse there.
2687	2691	"Now he'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
2691	2695	"His eyes would undress every girl in the house
2695	2703	"Perhaps he is better described as a louse And still people came just the same
2703	2707	"Now he smiles from the bar on the people below
2707	2711	"And one night he smiled on my love
2711	2713	"She blew him a kiss
2713	2719	"And she hollered bravo And he hung by his schnozzle from above
2719	2723	"He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
2723	2728	"Daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful
2728	2737	"All the girls he does please And my love he has stolen away"
2737	2744	Do you mind if I take the third one?
2744	2748	"I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks
2748	2752	"While she spent her time with the circus' freaks
2752	2756	"The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
2756	2760	"Alas, Alack and Alaska
2760	2763	"I went to this fellow the villain, and I said
2763	2767	"I'lI see that you get your deserts
2767	2771	"His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer
2771	2775	"He sneered once again and said no
2775	2778	"He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
2778	2782	"That daring young man on the flying trapeze
2782	2786	"His actions are graceful The girls he does please
2786	2797	"My love he has stolen away"
2797	2800	-Everybody keep your seats. -Thank the man for me, Peter.
2800	2804	It's the first comfortable position I've been in all night.
2804	2808	"She flies through the air with the greatest of ease
2808	2811	"The daring young--"
2811	2814	What's the matter with you? Somebody help.
2814	2816	Something happened to her.
2816	2826	Look how pale she is.
2826	2828	Let's give her a chance to snap out of it.
2828	2832	Don't worry. She'll be all right.
2832	2837	We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.
2837	2839	What happened to your money?
2839	2844	Ma spent it all on the tickets. We didn't know it was gonna be so much.
2844	2847	We shouldn't have come, I guess.
2847	2850	But Ma said there was a job waiting for her in New York...
2850	2859	...and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
2859	2862	She'll be all right when she's had something to eat.
2862	2866	The next time we come to, you buy some food. Now come on.
2866	2869	I shouldn't ought to take this. Ma'll get mad.
2869	2872	Don't tell her. You don't want her to get sick again.
2872	2874	No, but you might need it.
2874	2875	Come on.
2875	2877	I got millions.
2877	2878	Here.
2878	2897	-Thanks. -Come on, go back.
2897	2899	Better phone for some help.
2899	2902	Go phone if you want to. The nearest town is 1 0 miles away.
2902	2904	Yeah?
2904	2908	Say, buddy. Like to take a look at my paper?
2908	2912	Travelling like this, you lose track of what's going on in the world.
2912	2916	Take that story there, for instance.
2916	2919	If I was to see that dame, you know what I'd do?
2919	2920	No.
2920	2922	I'd go fifty-fifty with you.
2922	2923	Why?
2923	2925	Because I don't believe in hogging.
2925	2929	A bird that figures that way always ends up behind the eight ball.
2929	2934	That's what I always say.
2934	2935	What's on your mind?
2935	2944	Five G's or I crab the works.
2944	2947	Let's get away from here and talk this over privately.
2947	2954	I knew she wasn't your wife all the time.
2954	2957	Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
2957	2960	-You made no mistake, believe me. -I can use a smart guy like you.
2960	2964	-When you're talking to old man Shapeley... -Can you make a gat?
2964	2965	Huh?
2965	2968	A gat. A rod.
2968	2971	-Got any fireworks on you? -No.
2971	2975	I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll give you one of them.
2975	2979	May have trouble up north. Have to shoot it out with the cops.
2979	2982	If you manage, those five G's are as good as in the bag. Maybe more.
2982	2985	I'll talk to the Killer, he'll take care of you.
2985	2986	Killer?
2986	2989	Yeah. The big boy. The boss of the outfit.
2989	2991	You're not kidnapping her, are you?
2991	2995	What else, stupid? You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward?
2995	2998	$1 0, 000? Chicken feed.
2998	3002	Now listen, we're holding that dame for a million smackers.
3002	3006	Say, I didn't know it was anything like this. You see, I've got....
3006	3008	What's the matter? You getting yellow?
3008	3012	I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't afford to get....
3012	3015	Pipe down your mug before I....
3015	3018	What are you trying to do, tell the whole world about it?
3018	3021	Listen, you're into this thing and you're staying in, get me?
3021	3023	You know too much.
3023	3025	I won't say anything, honest I won't.
3025	3028	How do I know that? I got a notion to plug you.
3028	3032	-Why should I take a chance with you? -Trust me, mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
3032	3035	Yeah?
3035	3037	What's your name?
3037	3039	Oscar Shapeley.
3039	3041	-Where do you live? -Orange, New Jersey.
3041	3043	Got a couple of kids?
3043	3047	Yes, sir. Just babies. A little golden-haired girl.
3047	3050	-You love them, don't you? -Yes, I do.
3050	3052	You wouldn't. You're not thinking of--
3052	3054	-You keep your trap shut, all right? -Sure.
3054	3057	-If you don't.... -I'll keep my trap shut. I will.
3057	3059	You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
3059	3061	Bugs Dooley? No.
3061	3065	He was a nice guy, just like you. And he made a big mistake one day.
3065	3066	Got a little too talkative.
3066	3068	-You know what happened to his kid? -No.
3068	3072	I can't tell you. But when Bugs heard about it he blew his brains out.
3072	3074	That's terrible.
3074	3077	He had it coming to him. He talked too much. I never talk.
3077	3080	I never say a word. Word of honour.
3080	3083	I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
3083	3086	Okay. Just remember that.
3086	3087	Now beat it.
3087	3092	Sure, mister. Thanks. I always knew you guys were--
3092	3095	Come on, scram. And stay away from that bus.
3095	3097	Sure. Anything you say.
3097	3100	-You wouldn't shoot me in the back? -If you don't beat it....
3100	3116	I'm going.
3116	3119	What's wrong? Why do we have to leave the bus?
3119	3121	Come on. Don't ask so many questions.
3121	3129	Why?
3129	3132	Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
3132	3137	At the rate he's going, he's probably crossed two state lines by this time.
3137	3140	Why did we have to leave the bus?
3140	3145	When Shapeley stops running, he's going to start thinking, isn't he?
3145	3148	I've been doing a little thinking myself.
3148	3151	The next town we come to, you better wire your father.
3151	3153	What's the matter, are you weakening?
3153	3159	No. I was just thinking of you. A starvation diet may not agree with you.
3159	3161	Did you give that child all your money?
3161	3164	I gave him nothing. You were the big-hearted gal.
3164	3166	All the money I had was that ten spot.
3166	3169	So I've been thinking you better wire your father.
3169	3174	No, sir. I started out for New York and I'm going to get there...
3174	3176	...if I have to starve all the way.
3176	3178	Okay.
3178	3182	What is this strange power this man Westley has over you women?
3182	3184	Here, take these.
3184	3187	-Hold on to them. Get up on that log. -That?
3187	3199	Get up on the log.
3199	3201	I wish you'd stop being playful.
3201	3207	So sorry. You know, this is the first time in years I've ridden piggyback.
3207	3208	This isn't piggyback.
3208	3211	-Of course it is. -You're crazy.
3211	3215	I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride.
3215	3217	-And he carried you like this? -Yes.
3217	3221	Your father didn't know beans about piggyback riding.
3221	3225	My uncle has four children. I've seen them ride piggyback.
3225	3228	I'll bet there isn't a good piggyback rider in your family.
3228	3232	I never knew a rich man who could piggyback ride.
3232	3234	You're prejudiced.
3234	3237	Show me a good piggy backer. I'll show you a real human.
3237	3240	Take Abraham LincoIn for instance. A natural born piggy backer.
3240	3245	Where do you get off with that stuffed-shirt family of yours?
3245	3249	My father was a great piggy backer.
3249	3255	Here, hold this a minute.
3255	3262	Thank you.
3262	3279	How long does this keep up? My feet are killing me.
3279	3281	This looks like the best spot.
3281	3284	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
3284	3288	I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a good imitation of it.
3288	3289	Peter?
3289	3291	What?
3291	3293	I'm awfully hungry.
3293	3295	It's just your imagination.
3295	3296	No it isn't.
3296	3300	I'm hungry and scared.
3300	3302	You can't be hungry and scared both at the same time.
3302	3304	Well, I am.
3304	3306	If you're scared, it scares the hunger out of you.
3306	3309	Not if you're more hungry than scared.
3309	3314	All right, you win. Let's forget about it.
3314	3317	I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
3317	3322	Holy smoke! Why did I ever get mixed up with you?
3322	3325	If I had any sense, I'd be in New York by this time.
3325	3327	What about your story?
3327	3333	Taking a married woman back to her husband.
3333	3338	I turned out to be the prize sucker.
3338	3341	All right, come on. Your bed's all ready.
3341	3344	I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
3344	3345	-Then take them off. -What?
3345	3380	All right, don't take them off. Do what you please, but shut up about it.
3380	3383	You're becoming awfully disagreeable lately.
3383	3390	You just snap my head off every time I open my mouth.
3390	3395	If being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave.
3395	3398	You can leave any time you see fit.
3398	3402	Nobody's holding you here.
3402	3409	I can get along.
3409	3413	Peter?
3413	3423	Peter!
3423	3425	-What's the matter? -I was so scared!
3425	3429	What's got into you? I left for a minute to find you something to eat.
3429	3431	I know but....
3431	3433	Here, eat your head off.
3433	3434	I don't want it now.
3434	3437	-I thought you said you were hungry. -I was, but--
3437	3438	But what?
3438	3441	I was so scared, it scared the hunger--
3441	3488	Holy jumping catfish. You drive a guy crazy.
3488	3490	It's liable to get chilly before morning.
3490	3528	Better use this.
3528	3532	What are you thinking about?
3532	3536	By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
3536	3539	-Really? -Yeah.
3539	3577	I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
3577	3579	What did you say we're supposed to be doing?
3579	3583	Hitchhiking.
3583	3587	You've given me a very good example of the hiking.
3587	3589	Where does the hitching come in?
3589	3594	It's a little early yet. No cars out.
3594	3597	If it's the same to you...
3597	3611	...I'm going to sit right here and wait until they come.
3611	3612	You got a toothpick?
3612	3615	-What's the matter? -I got hay in my teeth.
3615	3619	No, I haven't got a toothpick. Here, I got a penknife, though.
3619	3620	Now hold still.
3620	3624	-Be careful. -All right. Where is it?
3624	3628	All right, now hold still.
3628	3630	Here. Get it?
3630	3632	Thanks.
3632	3636	You should have swallowed that. You won't have any breakfast, you know?
3636	3641	You needn't rub it in.
3641	3644	-What are you eating? -Carrots.
3644	3647	-Raw? -Want one?
3647	3651	No. Why didn't you get me something I could eat?
3651	3655	That's right, I forgot. The idea of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.
3655	3659	You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you, do you?
3659	3661	Have one of these. Best thing for you, carrots.
3661	3666	I hate the horrid things.
3666	3669	I wish you wouldn't talk so much. Now we let a car get away.
3669	3672	And suppose nobody stops for us?
3672	3675	They'll stop all right. It's a matter of knowing how to handle them.
3675	3677	And you're an expert I suppose.
3677	3681	Expert. And I'll write a book about it. Call it "The Hitchhiker's Hail."
3681	3684	There's no end to your accomplishments, is there?
3684	3686	-You think it's simple? -No.
3686	3690	Well, it is simple. It's all in that old thumb, see?
3690	3694	Some people do it like this. Or like this.
3694	3696	All wrong. Never get anywhere.
3696	3697	The poor things.
3697	3701	But that old thumb never fails. It's all a matter of how you do it, though.
3701	3704	Now you take No. 1, for instance.
3704	3707	That's a short jerky movement, like this. That shows independence.
3707	3710	You don't care if they stop or not. You got money.
3710	3714	-Clever. -No. 2, that's a little wider movement.
3714	3717	Smile goes with this one, like this.
3717	3722	That means you got a brand-new story about the farmer's daughter.
3722	3725	You figured that out all by yourself?
3725	3728	That's nothing. No. 3, that's a pip. That's the pitiful one.
3728	3731	When you're broke and hungry, everything looks black.
3731	3736	It's a long sweeping movement like this. Gotta follow through, though.
3736	3738	That's amazing.
3738	3741	But it's no good, if you haven't got a long face to go with it.
3741	3742	Here comes a car.
3742	3745	Okay. Now watch me. I'm gonna use No. 1 .
3745	3754	Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
3754	3756	I still got my eye on the thumb.
3756	3760	Something must have gone wrong. I'll try No. 2.
3760	3802	When you get to 1 00, wake me up.
3802	3806	I don't think I'll write that book after all.
3806	3810	Think of all the fun you had, though.
3810	3812	You mind if I try?
3812	3814	You?
3814	3818	Don't make me laugh.
3818	3822	You're such a smart aleck. Nobody knows anything but you.
3822	3826	I'll stop a car and I won't use my thumb.
3826	3827	What are you gonna do?
3827	3850	It's a system all my own.
3850	3853	Aren't you going to give me a little credit?
3853	3855	What for?
3855	3860	I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
3860	3864	Why didn't you take off all your clothes? You could have stopped 40 cars.
3864	3867	I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.
3867	3871	So, you're just married? That's pretty good.
3871	3876	But if I was young, that's the way I'd spend my honeymoon. Hitchhiking.
3876	3880	Yes, sir. "Hitchhiking down the highway
3880	3885	"Of love on a honeymoon
3885	3899	"Hitchhiking down the highway, down"
3899	3902	Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
3902	3905	Tonsil? Me? No.
3905	3911	Me burn a tonsil? "My tonsils won't burn"
3911	3913	All right, let it go.
3913	3924	"Turn"
3924	3926	How about a bite to eat?
3926	3928	-That would be lovely. -No thanks, we're not hungry.
3928	3930	Young people in love are never hungry.
3930	3931	No.
3931	3934	"Young people in love
3934	3939	"Are very seldom hungry
3939	3945	"People in love are very seldom hungry"
3945	3949	What were you going to do? Gold dig that guy for a meal?
3949	3952	Sure, I was. No fooling, I'm hungry.
3952	3954	Eat a carrot.
3954	3956	No.
3956	3958	I'm going in to ask him.
3958	3972	You do and I'll break your neck.
3972	4001	Come on, let's get out of here. Stretch our legs.
4001	4003	I'm sorry....
4003	4016	That's all right.
4016	4019	Hey! Come here!
4019	4044	You've got my suitcase!
4044	4046	What happened to you? I was worried.
4046	4049	-Get in. -Look at your face! You've got a cut!
4049	4051	Well, what happened?
4051	4054	A road thief. Picks people up, runs off with their things. What a racket.
4054	4056	How'd you get the car?
4056	4091	I gave him a black eye for it and had to tie him up to a tree.
4091	4094	Can't be much gas left in this thing.
4094	4098	Gotta start promoting some.
4098	4101	Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat.
4101	4139	That'll be good for ten gallons.
4139	4142	I haven't changed my mind, Westley. I want you to understand that.
4142	4145	I don't like you. Never have. Never will.
4145	4147	Now that's clear enough, isn't it?
4147	4149	You've made it evident by your threats of annulment.
4149	4151	lt hasn't worried me for a minute.
4151	4154	Ellie and I got married because we love each other.
4154	4158	She's proving it. As far as I'm concerned, there's going to be no annulment.
4158	4164	I see. You've got hold of a good thing and you're going to hang on to it?
4164	4169	All right, you win. I'll just have to get used to you.
4169	4174	I admit, I'm licked. But it's only because I'm worried.
4174	4178	If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy.
4178	4182	I could have helped if it hadn't been for you. I've been watched so closely--
4182	4187	I know. Well, you can help now. I've got a room full of reporters in there.
4187	4190	Now, I want you to make a statement.
4190	4194	Say that we've talked things over and come to an understanding.
4194	4208	And that if she returns I won't interfere with your marriage.
4208	4211	-All right? -Yeah, that's quite all right.
4211	4212	Okay.
4212	4215	I hope you and your wife spend a pleasant week with us.
4215	4217	So do I. Thank you. Goodnight.
4217	4221	Goodnight.
4221	4223	-All right, brat. -Any luck?
4223	4226	Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a cabin.
4226	4227	What about the money?
4227	4231	I talked him out of that idea. He thinks we're staying a week.
4231	4234	-I must think something up before morning. -That's swell.
4234	4239	Yeah? I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, I think it's foolish.
4239	4248	I told you there's no use in staying here. We can make New York in three hours.
4248	4255	I thought you were in a hurry to get back.
4255	4259	Whoever heard of getting in at 3.00 in the morning?
4259	4267	Everybody will be asleep.
4267	4296	Okay. Cottage no. 6.
4296	4300	There you go, trusting people again. How many times did I tell you--
4300	4310	But he looked like a nice, upright young fellow, Ma.
4310	4317	We're on the last lap.
4317	4319	Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband.
4319	4323	Yeah.
4323	4325	You'lI have a great story, won't you?
4325	4351	Yeah. Swell.
4351	4387	Thanks.
4387	4391	We certainly outsmarted your father.
4391	4394	I guess you ought to be happy.
4394	4398	Am I going to see you in New York?
4398	4402	Nope.
4402	4404	Why not?
4404	4410	I don't make it a policy to run around with married women.
4410	4414	There's no harm in your coming to see us.
4414	4419	Not interested.
4419	4422	Won't I ever see you again?
4422	4424	What for? I've served my purpose!
4424	4464	I brought you back to King Westley. That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
4464	4468	Have you ever been in love, Peter?
4468	4470	Me?
4470	4473	Yes.
4473	4478	Haven't you ever thought about it at all?
4478	4484	lt seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
4484	4491	Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't?
4491	4495	If I could ever meet the right sort of girl.
4495	4497	Where are you gonna find her?
4497	4499	Somebody that's real. Somebody that's alive.
4499	4506	They don't come that way anymore.
4506	4510	Have I ever thought about it?
4510	4519	I've even been sucker enough to make plans.
4519	4527	I saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it.
4527	4531	That's where I'd like to take her.
4531	4534	She'd have to be the sort of a girl...
4534	4544	...who'd jump in the surf with me and love it as much as I did.
4544	4550	Nights when you, the moon and the water all become one.
4550	4555	You feel you're part of something big and marvellous.
4555	4559	That's the only place to live.
4559	4570	The stars are so close overhead you feel you could reach up and stir them around.
4570	4573	I've been thinking about it.
4573	4585	Boy, if I could ever find a girl who was hungry for those things.
4585	4587	Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your island.
4587	4591	I want to do all those things you talked about.
4591	4595	You better go back to your bed.
4595	4598	I love you. Nothing else matters. But we can run away.
4598	4602	Everything will take care of itself. Please, Peter...
4602	4606	...I can't let you out of my life now.
4606	4622	I couldn't live without you.
4622	4634	You'd better go back to your bed.
4634	4674	I'm sorry.
4674	4717	Did you mean that? Would you really go?
4717	4720	All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York.
4720	4723	That bag's worth $25.
4723	4725	I got a bag. I got one for Christmas--
4725	4727	Here's what I'll do. I'll come back in the morning...
4727	4730	...and buy it back from you with a $1 0 profit.
4730	4732	-What do you say? -I ain't got a hat.
4732	4735	-What? -I ain't got a hat.
4735	4745	Well, you got one now. Come on, fill her up.
4745	4749	Where you been all this time? Everybody's been asking about you.
4749	4752	Get me one drink. Nobody disturbs me for the next haIf hour.
4752	4756	Sure, boss.
4756	4758	Hello, Agnes.
4758	4761	-Don't. He'll shoot you on sight. -Haven't been shot at in days.
4761	4764	-Get out of here! Get out! -Now listen, Joe.
4764	4765	Don't "Joe" me.
4765	4767	All right, Joe. Listen.
4767	4768	You know I've always liked you.
4768	4771	Anytime I could help you, ran across a good story...
4771	4774	...I came running to you with it. I got one now.
4774	4777	The wires were on the level. The biggest scoop ever.
4777	4779	-It's yours. -About the Andrews kid?
4779	4782	I've got it all written up, ready to go. All I want is a $1,000.
4782	4784	A $1,000? Get out of here before--
4784	4786	Don't get sore. You gotta do this for me.
4786	4789	I need a $1,000 and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
4789	4790	What's the $1,000 for?
4790	4794	To tear down the walls of Jericho.
4794	4796	...Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage?
4796	4798	-She'll marry somebody else. -You're drunk.
4798	4800	Would such a story be worth $1,000 to you?
4800	4805	-If it was on the level. -I got it, Joe.
4805	4810	-Who's the guy she's gonna marry? -I am.
4810	4812	-You? -Yes.
4812	4815	Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me anymore.
4815	4818	For heaven sakes! Stop being an editor for a minute.
4818	4821	We know each other. You ought to know when I'm serious.
4821	4823	This is on the level. I met her on a bus from Miami.
4823	4826	I've been with her every minute. I'm in love with her.
4826	4829	You gotta get me this money now, quick. Minutes count.
4829	4831	She's waiting for me outside Philadelphia.
4831	4835	I gotta get right back. She doesn't even know I'm gone.
4835	4838	A guy can't propose to a gal without a cent in the world, can he?
4838	4843	What a story. On her way to join husband, Ellen Andrews--
4843	4846	That's it.
4846	4850	Let me see that a minute.
4850	4855	Zeke!
4855	4858	I told you, you couldn't trust him. He's gone.
4858	4859	Who?
4859	4863	The fella who was gonna stay a week. He skipped and took the car with him, too.
4863	4866	We wouldn't have known till morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.
4866	4869	Get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
4869	4887	There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone.
4887	4888	See that? They're gone.
4888	4893	Looks like it, don't it? What's this?
4893	4896	Ma ! Here's the woman.
4896	4899	-What's the matter? -Where's your husband?
4899	4903	-Husband? -Yes, if he is your husband.
4903	4908	-lsn't he here? -No, he ain't. The car's gone, too.
4908	4911	You got any money?
4911	4913	-No. -Then you'lI have to git!
4913	4917	Yeah. You'lI have to git.
4917	4920	Please, may I use your phone? I've got to call New York.
4920	4922	You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call.
4922	4928	Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter mile down the road. They'll fix you up.
4928	4937	And listen, next time you better not come back here. I run a respectable place.
4937	4940	-Thanks, you saved my life. -Okay. So long kid and good luck.
4940	4959	Goodbye. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful.
4959	4964	I've got a story that'll make your hair curl. Wait a minute. Don't annoy me, I'm busy.
4964	4968	Agnes, send Mike in here! Dig up all the pictures on that Andrews kid.
4968	4973	And Hank, listen, get Haley out of bed. I want a cartoon and I want it quick.
4973	4975	Westley's in it. He's waiting at the church...
4975	4979	...with tears on his face. The bride didn't show up.
4979	4981	Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off.
4981	4987	Everything exaggerated. Snap into it. What is it?
4987	4989	Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.
4989	4993	I'm not. She phoned her father from an auto camp asking him to come.
4993	4996	He's getting a police escort and Westley's going along.
4996	4999	Yes, she's been travelling by bus.
4999	5002	When she found out her father and Westley made up, she phoned.
5002	5006	Okay, grab a car and stay with them. Get Hank again.
5006	5009	Agnes, get me a doctor, I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
5009	5012	Hank, forget what I told you. I'm having a nightmare.
5012	5015	Agnes, you call the police department. Tell them to find Peter Warne.
5015	5018	Send out a general alarm. I want that dirty crook pinched.
5018	5019	You want us?
5019	5022	Change the front page! Ellen Andrews just phoned her father.
5022	5025	She's going home. She found out Dad withdrew his objections.
5025	5028	She gave herseIf up. Spread it all over the place!
5028	5032	Play it up big! Major league! "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it.
5032	5049	Okay.
5049	5063	Come on, baby. We gotta get there before she wakes up.
5063	5068	Can't you drive any faster?
5068	5083	"Young people in love are never hungry"
5083	5097	Come on, baby. We've got a police escort.
5097	5104	Come on, baby. They can't make a sucker out of us.
5104	5108	All right, come on. Step back. Give them room.
5108	5112	Come on, step back.
5112	5114	How about a picture for the paper, Mr. Andrews?
5114	5126	Wait till she gets home. Later, boys. Later.
5126	5131	"He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
5131	5149	"The daring young man on the flying trapeze"
5149	5151	Get that thing out of the way!
5151	5177	Keep your britches on, we'll get it out.
5177	5245	Hey, you darn fool !
5245	5258	Ellen Andrews is going to marry that Westley guy again.
5258	5260	Gordon's out back some place.
5260	5267	When he comes in, give him this. Tell him I was just kidding.
5267	5270	-You can't get a thing done around here. -Peter was just in.
5270	5272	-What? -He left this money.
5272	5274	-He said he was just kidding. -Where is he?
5274	5279	-There he goes. -Hey, Pete!
5279	5284	Hello. I'm sorry, it was just a little gag. I thought I'd have some fun with you.
5284	5287	Yeah, sure you had me going for a little while, too.
5287	5290	-lt wouldn't have made a bad story at that. -No, great.
5290	5293	But that's the way things go. You think you've got a great yarn...
5293	5299	...and then something comes along and messes up the finish. And there you are.
5299	5307	Yeah. Where am I?
5307	5311	When you sober up, come in and talk to me.
5311	5338	Thanks.
5338	5339	Ellie?
5339	5341	Hello, Dad.
5341	5343	I knocked several times.
5343	5346	I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming.
5346	5351	Everything's set. Creating quite a furore, too.
5351	5354	Great stunt King is going to pull.
5354	5355	Stunt?
5355	5360	Yeah, he's landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
5360	5362	Yes, I heard.
5362	5365	Personally, I think it's silly, too.
5365	5367	You look lovely, child.
5367	5370	Are you pleased with the gown?
5370	5374	Ellie?
5374	5383	The gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it?
5383	5388	What's the matter, child?
5388	5389	What's wrong?
5389	5391	Nothing.
5391	5394	You haven't changed your mind about King have you?
5394	5395	No.
5395	5400	Because if you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him.
5400	5403	Well, you gave me such a scare when I couldn't find you.
5403	5406	You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
5406	5411	I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world. You know that.
5411	5414	What's the matter, child?
5414	5419	Aren't you happy?
5419	5421	I thought so.
5421	5426	I knew there was something on your mind.
5426	5430	There, now.
5430	5433	What's the matter?
5433	5439	You haven't fallen in love with someone else, have you?
5439	5443	Have you?
5443	5447	I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby.
5447	5451	This must be serious.
5451	5455	Where'd you meet him?
5455	5456	On the road.
5456	5459	Now don't tell me you've fallen in love with a bus driver?
5459	5465	Oh, no.
5465	5468	Who is he?
5468	5471	I don't know very much about him.
5471	5473	Except that I love him.
5473	5477	If it's as serious as all that, we'll move heaven and earth to--
5477	5481	No, it's no use. He despises me.
5481	5481	Come now.
5481	5485	Yes, he does. He despises everything about me.
5485	5491	He says that I'm spoiled and selfish and pampered and thoroughly insincere.
5491	5493	Ridiculous.
5493	5496	He doesn't think so much of you, either.
5496	5497	Well, I--
5497	5500	And he blames you for everything that's wrong with me.
5500	5503	He says you raised me stupidly.
5503	5506	And now that's a fine man to fall in love with.
5506	5508	He's marvellous.
5508	5513	What are we going to do about it? Where is he?
5513	5516	-I don't know. -I'd like to have a talk with him.
5516	5521	lt wouldn't do any good. I practically threw myseIf at him.
5521	5526	Under the circumstances, don't you think we'd better call this thing off?
5526	5527	No, I'll go through with it.
5527	5531	But that's silly. Seeing the way you feel about him.
5531	5534	No, it doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble.
5534	5536	I've done it all my life.
5536	5541	I've made your life miserable. And mine, too.
5541	5547	I'm tired, father. I'm tired of running around in circles.
5547	5551	He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
5551	5554	I've got to settle down.
5554	5559	lt doesn't matter how, where, or with whom.
5559	5562	You've changed, Ellie.
5562	5568	I can't walk out on King now. lt would make us all look so ridiculous.
5568	5572	Anyway, what difference does it make?
5572	5574	I'll never see Peter again.
5574	5578	ls that his name?
5578	5581	Peter Warne.
5581	5585	Peter Warne.
5585	5587	Why, do you know him?
5587	5589	Why, no.
5589	5591	Father, you haven't heard from him, have you?
5591	5607	-Don't be silly, of course. -Please, what's that?
5607	5611	I guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it?
5611	5615	-The reward. -I'm sorry you read it.
5615	5619	-Are you going to see him? -I suppose so.
5619	5623	Certainly. Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job.
5623	5628	He kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
5628	5631	Thank you, Mary. That's just what I needed.
5631	5633	Mr. Westley's on his way up.
5633	5641	Fine, have him come in.
5641	5654	I'll be going.
5654	5658	If it isn't the bridegroom himself. You're just in time, King.
5658	5660	How are you, Ellie?
5660	5661	You happy?
5661	5664	Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy?
5664	5666	Here we are, let's drink.
5666	5669	It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement.
5669	5673	We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment.
5673	5676	We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off.
5676	5697	-Promise you'll never let me get off. -Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise.
5697	5702	Yeah. Who?
5702	5704	Why can't I see you at your office?
5704	5707	I'm leaving for Washington tonight. I may be gone several weeks.
5707	5720	I thought, perhaps, you'd like to get this thing settled.
5720	5726	No. Why do I wanna--
5726	5730	Hey, wait a minute. Maybe I will come over. Yeah.
5730	5734	I'd like to get a load of that three ring circus you're pulling.
5734	5736	I wanna see what love looks like when it's triumphant.
5736	5742	I haven't had a good laugh in a week.
5742	5742	Mr. Warne?
5742	5746	Yeah.
5746	5749	-Sit down. -Thanks.
5749	5753	I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything...
5753	5755	...about you. About your helping her.
5755	5758	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.
5758	5761	Why did she think I lugged her from Miami?
5761	5764	She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
5764	5768	She does? lsn't that sweet of her? You don't, I suppose.
5768	5773	Well, I don't know. I'lI have to see on what you base your claim.
5773	5775	I presume you feel justified.
5775	5781	If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. I got it all itemised.
5781	5786	"Cash outlay, $8.60. Top coat, $1 5.
5786	5789	"Suitcase, $7.50. Hat, $4.
5789	5795	"Three shirts, $4.50. Total, $39.60.
5795	5798	"All of the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline."
5798	5801	And I sold some shorts and socks, too. I'm throwing those in.
5801	5805	-Yes, I know. -What's the matter? lsn't it cheap enough?
5805	5808	Trip like that'd cost you a $1,000, maybe more.
5808	5813	Now, let me get this straight. You want $39.60 in addition to the $1 0,000?
5813	5815	What 1 0,000?
5815	5818	The reward.
5818	5820	Who said anything about a reward?
5820	5823	I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused. I assumed--
5823	5828	All I want is $39.60. If you give me a check for it, I'll get out of this joint.
5828	5830	lt gives me the jitters.
5830	5833	-You're a peculiar chap. -We'll go into that some other time.
5833	5836	The average man would go after the reward.
5836	5839	Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you?
5839	5842	It's a matter of principle. You probably wouldn't understand.
5842	5846	When anybody takes me for a buggy ride, I don't like paying for the privilege.
5846	5848	Were you taken for a buggy ride?
5848	5852	Yes. With all the trimmings. So how about the check, do I get it?
5852	5869	-Certainly. -Thanks.
5869	5871	Here you are.
5871	5873	Thank you.
5873	5877	Do you mind if I ask you a question, frankly?
5877	5880	Do you love my daughter?
5880	5883	Any guy in love with your daughter should be examined.
5883	5885	Now that's an evasion.
5885	5889	She picked herseIf a perfect running mate, King Westley. The pill of the century.
5889	5893	She needs a guy that'd sock her once a day whether it's coming to her or not.
5893	5896	If you were wiser, you'd have done it yourseIf long ago.
5896	5897	Do you love her?
5897	5901	A normal man couldn't live with her without going nutty.
5901	5902	She's my idea of nothing.
5902	5904	I asked you a simple question! Do you love her?
5904	5911	Yes! Now don't hold that against me! I'm a little screwy myself!
5911	5920	Here's to the merry-go-round.
5920	5929	Perfect. Now you look natural.
5929	5931	-I hope you got your money. -You bet I did.
5931	5935	-Congratulations. -Thanks. Same to you.
5935	5938	Stay around and watch the fun. You'll enjoy it immensely.
5938	5946	I would, but I've got a weak stomach.
5946	5949	-I just had a long talk with him. -I'm not interested.
5949	5951	Now just a minute, Ellie.
5951	5966	I don't want to hear another word about him.
5966	6023	Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived.
6023	6054	Here they come, boys. Turn them over.
6054	6057	You're a sucker to go through with this.
6057	6060	That guy, Warne, is okay.
6060	6064	He didn't want the reward. All he asked for was $39.60.
6064	6068	It's what he spent on you. Said it was a matter of principle.
6068	6077	You took him for a ride.
6077	6082	He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.
6082	6086	You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley.
6086	6092	I can buy him off for a pot of gold.
6092	6095	And you can make an old man happy.
6095	6098	And you won't do so bad for yourself.
6098	6112	If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate.
6112	6115	Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God...
6115	6119	...and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman...
6119	6124	...in holy matrimony. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully...
6124	6132	...be joined together, let him now speak or else, hereafter forever, hold his peace.
6132	6137	King, will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as you both shall live?
6137	6139	I will.
6139	6143	Ellen, will thou have this man to thy wedded husband...
6143	6149	...so long as you both shall live?
6149	6152	Ellen!
6152	6183	Ellie!
6183	6184	What happened?
6184	6201	I haven't the slightest idea.
6201	6205	Don't want to talk to you. Don't want to talk to anybody.
6205	6207	Don't want to see anybody.
6207	6212	But it's King Westley on the phone.
6212	6219	Hello, my would be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for $1 00,000.
6219	6224	That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment.
6224	6228	That's satisfactory, isn't it? lt ought to be.
6228	6233	I'm not complaining. Not complaining. lt was dirt-cheap.
6233	6237	Don't fall out of any windows!
6237	6241	There's another wire from Peter. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
6241	6245	"What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke.
6245	6249	"The walls of Jericho are toppling."
6249	6257	Send him a telegram right away. Just say, "Let them topple."
6257	6259	-Funny couple, ain't they? -Yeah.
6259	6262	If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
6262	6265	They're married, all right. I just seen the license.
6265	6269	They made me get them a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
6269	6270	What do you reckon that's for?
6270	6273	Blamed if I know. I just brought them a trumpet.
6273	6274	A trumpet?
6274	6276	A toy. They sent me to the store to get it.
6276	6279	What in the world do they want a trumpet for?
6279	6281	Don't know.
