22	26	The world. Six billion people...
26	31	When I was a kid, there were three. It's hard to keep up.
32	36	That's better. That's America.
36	40	America still sets the tone for the world.
41	45	In Indiana, Clark Hodd. The country's best point-guard.
45	50	Last week he scored 100 points in a single game.
50	54	Erica Sorgi. You'll see her ln the next Olympics.
55	61	In Seattle. Dallas Malloy, 16. One of the premier women boxers.
61	65	She's thinking about her boyfriend right now.
65	71	Indio, California. Art Stallings. Check out what pure joy looks like.
71	75	Odessa, Texas. The great Frank Cushman.
76	81	Next April, 26 teams will be falling over themeselves to sign him.
81	84	He's my most important client.
84	87	Start trying!
87	92	There's genius everywhere. Some make it...
92	97	- You don't know diddley about golf! - ...some don't.
98	102	I'm the guy you don't usually see.
102	105	I'm behlnd the scenes. I'm the sports agent.
105	109	- I'm gonna hurt you this year. - Hi, Jerry.
109	115	My door's always open if you want to come and get a real agent.
115	119	I'm going to a meeting right now to talk about you.
119	124	- We've got to win Super Bowls. - Jerry, how are you doing?
125	129	- Who much is this gonna cost me? - I know what you can afford.
130	133	I'll write it down for you.
133	137	- I can't afford that. - Winning isn't cheap.
138	144	The new player and owner photo. That's me on the left.
144	149	This is where I work. SMI. Sports Management International.
150	158	33 agents guiding the careers of 1,685 finely-tuned athletes.
160	166	I handle the lives of 72 clients and get 264 phone calls a day.
166	172	I will not rest until you're holding a coke in your own commercial, -
172	177	- broadcast during a Super Bowl game that you're winning.
177	179	It's what I do best.
180	184	I started noticing a few years ago...
184	189	In the quest for the big dollar, little things were golng wrong.
189	195	There's no proof of anything. This guy is a sensational athlete.
196	200	Are you Calvin Nack? Can you sign my card?
200	203	I'm sorry, little fella, I can't.
204	209	- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards. - I just wanted an autograph.
209	212	Lately, it's gotten worse.
218	221	Hi, baby.
221	224	Do you know your name?
229	234	Wait, it's coming... My name is Steve Remo.
234	239	I play for Chicago. This lady here is my wife.
241	245	This is my boy. And this is...
247	251	Wait... My agent!
251	256	I've got to play this weekend, Doc. I've got to play 65% of my games.
257	260	I've got to get the bonus.
260	264	- Okay, Jesse, take care. - Mr. Maguire...
264	269	This is his fourth concussion. Shouldn't he stop?
269	273	It would take a tank to stop your dad.
273	280	It would take all five Super Trooper Warriors.
280	282	Right?
283	285	Right?
286	289	Fuck you!
291	296	Who had I become? Just another shark in a suit?
311	318	Salaries are skyrocketing, and you are one of the guys responsible.
322	328	Two days later, at our conference in Miami, a breakthrough.
328	332	Breakdown? Breakthrough.
332	335	- I just wanted an autograph. - Fuck you.
337	341	I couldn't escape one simple thought.
342	345	I hated myself.
346	352	No, here's what it was... I hated my place in the world.
357	362	I had so much to say, and no one to listen.
362	366	And then it happened...
368	373	It was the oddest, most unexpected thing...
373	378	I began writing what they call a mission statement.
378	382	A suggestion for the future of our company.
383	389	A night like this doesn't come along very often. I seized it.
389	393	What started out as one page, became 25.
393	396	I was my father's son again.
397	401	Remembering the simple pleasures of this job.
401	405	The way a stadium sounds when a player performs well.
406	410	The way we're supposed to help them in health and injury.
410	414	With so many clients, we had forgotten what was important.
415	420	I wrote and wrote ... and I'm not even a writer.
420	425	I was remembering my mentor Dicky Fox, who said:
425	429	The key to this business is personal relationships.
429	435	Suddenly, it was all clear. The answer was fewer clients.
435	440	Less money. Caring for them and caring for ourselves.
440	444	Just starting our lives... really!
444	449	I'll be the first to admit, what I was writing was touchy-feely.
449	455	I didn't care. It was the me I'd always wanted to be.
459	463	I went out and printed up 110 copies.
463	467	Even the cover looked like the "Catcher in the Rye".
467	471	I entitled it, "The Things We Think and Do Not Say".
472	474	"The Future of Our Business"
475	481	That's how you become great, man. Hang your balls out there.
481	484	Thanks.
485	488	Everybody got a copy.
488	492	Some of the animals out there walk on two feet.
492	497	Society needs protection from these warped minds.
512	514	Boom!
516	520	This is Jerry Maguire. Those manuscripts...
520	526	Oh, they did? No, that's fine, thank you.
554	558	Finally, somebody said it.
559	563	Good work, Maguire.
580	585	I was 35, and I'd started my life.
585	590	- How long do you give him? - About a week.
599	602	- Are you with the sports people? - Jerry Maguire, SMI.
603	607	Bobbi Fallon, BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials.
607	609	Good luck.
610	615	My son is really allergic to the blanket material...
615	619	That's all we have, okay?
622	627	- I'm sorry if I was rude just now. - That's okay. We're both in it now.
628	634	Why is it so easy to talk to you? Tell me about your fiancée.
635	640	Honey, are you all right? Do you want some juice?
640	645	Thank you. We're out hiking.
645	651	I've got the ring in my pocket. I'm a little nervous.
651	656	She says to me... Get this: "Hurry up, klutz."
656	661	It bothered me somewhat. I got quiet. Then she got quiet.
661	667	I decide not to propose. The mood isn't right.
668	673	But I know that she knows that I was going to propose.
673	677	- So we check back into the hotel. - How sad.
677	682	Little do I know, but my assistant presumes I've now proposed.
682	688	She's got the lounge band to play "Here Comes The Bride".
688	693	There's football players watching and an ESPN crew.
694	697	So I turn to her and grandly say:
697	704	"Goddess of Rock Climbing, would you marry a klutz?"
704	708	I took out the ring. I don't much like big scenes, -
708	713	- but she said "yes" right there ln the lobby.
713	716	The toughest men in football wept.
718	723	- We're getting married in February. - You'll stay married forever.
729	735	- What's wrong, Mom? - First Class is what's wrong.
735	740	It used to be a better meal, now it's a better life.
745	748	Ray?
748	753	Ray! Come on, buddy.
753	758	- Ray! - Excuse me, can I help you?
759	761	Jerry Maguire.
762	767	- I work in your office. - You're Dorothy Boyd in accounts.
768	773	By your desk is a photo of Einstein with Shaquille O'Neal's body.
774	779	- That's pretty good. - What did you lose here?
779	783	My son... My mind. Ray!
786	793	Dorothy, while I go look for him, you grab this gentleman here.
800	803	You scared me!
803	807	- Don't do that again, ever! - Okay, Mommy.
807	810	Ever, ever... ever!
810	816	- Dorothy... take care. - Thank you so much.
817	821	I loved your memo, by the way.
823	825	- You did? - Yeah.
828	833	Thanks. Actually, it was just a mission statement.
833	839	In this age, optimism like that is a revolutionary act.
839	844	I appreciate that. I didn't know if I should write it.
844	848	It was two in the morning, and some of the stuff I just...
849	854	That part about "embracing with enthusiasm...
854	861	...and forcing commerce to give a little back for the greater good."
863	867	I was inspired, and I'm an accountant.
867	871	I mean, to respect yourself enough to say it out loud.
871	876	To put yourself out there like that, so nakedly.
877	881	I don't know... It got me.
884	890	- Is this bothering you? - No, this is... great.
890	893	It's great.
893	898	Do you need a ride? Do you need a lift?
898	903	Oh, no! I'm sure that would just make your day.
903	908	Driving us out to Manhattan Beach. All those tiny streets.
908	913	Playing chicken with the traffic. Your life flashing before you.
913	918	- I've had too much coffee. - It's no problem.
918	923	There's my sister Laurel, to pick us up.
925	931	Ray... Dorothy... a pleasure.
931	934	Bye.
941	945	Hi, Ray. Hi, you. I'm double parked, let's go.
945	948	Is this everything?
952	957	Whoever snagged him must be some classy babe.
957	957	Whoever snagged him must be some classy babe.
959	964	Don't ever stop fucking me!
964	968	Sooner or later we'll have to stop!
969	972	Never been better... Never!
972	975	Never better!
979	986	Open your eyes. If you want it, I'd go with another woman for you.
986	990	I'm not interested in it, anymore.
990	993	It was a phase. A college thing.
994	997	Like torn Levis or law school for you.
997	1001	Want some fruit from the kitchen?
1006	1012	- Do you have to tell me everything? - That's what intimacy is.
1013	1019	- We're eating out tomorrow night. - I know about the bachelor party.
1019	1025	Your buddies worked hard for this. The guys from the office are coming.
1026	1032	Relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time.
1053	1057	Hey, old college-buddy. Congratulations.
1058	1061	- For you. - Thank you.
1061	1066	And this. The finest cigar my club has to offer.
1067	1073	This is what it's all about, man. Everybody loves you.
1073	1076	It pisses me off!
1076	1080	Whether you're country, a red-neck or a freak...
1081	1085	Young or old, from Moscow, London or Memphis...
1085	1090	Jerry Maguire will still be the king of rock and roll.
1090	1095	- Your little black book. - He makes my heart pound.
1096	1100	- I know Jerry pretty well. - Hi, Jerry, remember me?
1100	1104	- I'll see you for lunch tomorrow. - He was good in bed.
1104	1107	This is the funniest thing ever.
1108	1112	Jerry should get married. He won't be alone.
1112	1116	- He cannot be alone. - He can't be alone.
1116	1121	Jerry is great at friendship, but he's really bad at intimacy.
1122	1124	He can't be alone.
1124	1130	- He can't say, "I love you". - He's an agent. He lies.
1130	1136	- I love you too. - Hey, love you too.
1136	1139	I love you.
1141	1145	- I love you. - I love you.
1157	1162	- Good morning, Jenny. - Sorry I missed the party.
1162	1167	Good morning, Jerry. Marcee's here and she's in a hurry.
1168	1173	I'm glad to see you finally made it. Rod is very upset.
1173	1175	- Tyson, no! - Okay.
1176	1179	- Hello. - Long time no see!
1179	1183	- Tyson! - How can I make your life better?
1183	1188	Jerry, I don't want any bullshit. Where is our offer from Arizona?
1188	1193	- Cronin's for lunch? - This is Bob Sugar.
1193	1198	- He's called at our house. - Sorry to interrupt you.
1198	1203	You've got to earn your 4%. My husband has an image.
1203	1208	Putting him in a water-bed commercial makes him common.
1209	1213	He deserves the big four: Shoe, car, clothing line, soft drink.
1214	1217	I know about celebrity endorsement.
1218	1222	We both majored in marketing. We came to play!
1222	1225	The dirtyman is back!
1228	1231	- Hey. - Hey, buddy.
1234	1237	Are you okay?
1237	1243	- Fine. What's up? - I came here to let you go.
1243	1248	- Pardon me? - I came here to fire you, Jerry.
1252	1256	It's real. You should say something.
1262	1266	Shit.
1266	1272	A crowded restaurant... so there won't be a scene.
1279	1284	You ungrateful...
1284	1289	You did this to yourself. You said fewer clients.
1289	1292	How do you think it feels firing you?
1292	1298	I've thought about it all week. Get past yourself for a second!
1298	1301	- You'll lose. - You wanted smaller.
1301	1306	Well, now I want all my clients, and yours, too.
1324	1327	Wendy, bring me my numbers.
1342	1345	- Cush. - This is Sugar.
1345	1351	Look, you're the most important guy in sports. How does it feel?
1351	1355	I just want to play football. Dad, it's one of the agents.
1355	1361	Wendy! Keep trying Cushman. And please, bring me my numbers.
1361	1365	J.J., what's up? Have you talked to Maguire?
1365	1370	He had a meltdown. I've talked to Doritos about you.
1370	1374	They're very interested. Here, talk to Rick.
1374	1380	Carlo, you pay 25% of your endorsements to SMI. I'll take 18%.
1381	1385	I don't know if it was drugs, but the guy freaked out.
1385	1389	He's not the guy for you. How's your mom?
1389	1392	I'm gonna make this easy for you.
1392	1399	What does your heart tell you? I'm sorry to hear that.
1404	1409	- What's going on? - They've fired Jerry Maguire.
1417	1420	That's a mistake.
1420	1425	I'm concerned about your family and your future.
1425	1428	I go back a long way with SMI.
1428	1431	Is Maguire black?
1431	1436	Bob Sugar? He's... entertaining, funny...
1436	1440	I'm Mr. Black People!
1440	1443	Don't make this harder than it is.
1443	1447	I've got to be honest, this is very distressing for me.
1448	1453	Remember that stripper at Laguna Beach? Her name was April.
1453	1458	I remember things. It's not the money. I do it for you.
1458	1462	- I'm still holding for Katarina. - I'm talking big money.
1462	1465	Great!
1465	1469	Are you in or out? This is business not friendship.
1470	1473	You are in... that's good.
1473	1477	I want to cry for what they did to you.
1477	1482	If it wasn't for the Acura deal, you know I'd go with you.
1482	1488	Jerry. Oh, God!
1488	1493	Call waiting. Who could be calling me now?
1493	1497	- Hi, Kathy Sanders. - Still me, Kathy.
1499	1505	Kathy, why are you crying? Oh... so you're in.
1505	1508	Rod, it's Jerry Maguire.
1508	1511	Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?
1512	1516	I'll tell you. I'm sweating. Where's my contract?
1516	1520	Bob Sugar says I'm missing out being with you.
1520	1524	- You hear what I'm saying? - That's why I called.
1525	1529	No, no... Do you truly hear what I'm saying?
1529	1534	- I hear you, Dad. - We have to get together.
1534	1539	- Hold on a minute, Rod. - Personal attention.
1539	1545	- That's what you told my wife. - That's what I said.
1545	1550	Good! We're just getting started on the things you need to know.
1551	1553	I will kill for you.
1554	1559	I am a valuable commodity. There's dudes out there trying to kill me.
1559	1565	I still catch the ball. Touchdown! I make miracles happen.
1565	1568	Are you in?
1568	1571	I'm from Arizona. I broke Arizona records.
1571	1575	I went to Arizona State!
1575	1579	- And now you want Arizona dollars. - Exactly.
1579	1583	I'm sitting here with an ant problem.
1584	1589	My brother Tee Pee's room is flooded.
1589	1593	- Say hello to Jerry Maguire. - Hello.
1593	1596	Hello, Tee Pee.
1596	1603	No one's looking out for me. I'm supposed to be a superstar.
1604	1610	- Are you in or out? - You stay with Bob Sugar!
1610	1615	I am a role model. I have a family to support!
1615	1618	I want a contract in Arizona.
1618	1621	I like you.
1621	1625	My wife likes you. You're good to my wife.
1625	1629	- I will stay with you. - That's great.
1629	1633	That's what I'm gonna do for you. God bless you, Jerry.
1634	1638	This is what you're gonna do for me.
1638	1641	What can I do for you? You just tell me.
1642	1647	It's personal and very important. Hell! It's a family motto.
1647	1651	- Are you ready, Jerry? - I'm ready.
1651	1655	Here it is.
1655	1658	Show me the money.
1659	1661	Show...
1661	1665	...me ...the...
1665	1667	...money... !
1668	1674	- Say it with me, Jerry. - Show you the money.
1674	1677	No, you can do better than that.
1677	1681	- Bob Sugar's on the other line. - Show you the money.
1682	1685	- No, show me the money. - Show me the money.
1685	1688	- Louder! - Show me the money.
1689	1694	- You've got to yell that shit! - Show me the money!
1694	1698	- Louder, Jerry. - Show me the moneyl
1698	1702	Show me the money!
1702	1707	- You love this black man. - I love the black man!
1708	1712	- I love black people. - I love black people.
1713	1718	Show me the money!
1719	1722	Congratulations, you're still my agent.
1752	1758	Well... don't worry.
1758	1763	I'm not gonna do what you think I'm gonna do.
1767	1771	Let me just say...
1771	1776	...as I ease out of the office I helped build...
1776	1783	I'm sorry, but it's a fact that there's such a thing... as manners.
1785	1788	A way of treating people.
1790	1795	These fish have manners.
1795	1801	In fact, I'm starting a new company and the fish will come with me.
1801	1807	Call me sentimental, but the fish are coming with me.
1818	1821	Okay.
1823	1827	If anybody else wants to come with me, -
1827	1833	- this is a chance for something real, and fun, and inspiring -
1834	1839	- in this godforsaken business, and we will do it together.
1842	1847	Who's coming with me?
1847	1851	Who's coming with me?
1853	1857	Who's coming with me besides Flipper here?
1863	1867	This is embarrassing.
1870	1876	All right. Wendy, shall we?
1876	1881	I'm three months away from the pay increase...
1887	1890	Okay.
1898	1903	- I will go with you. - Dorothy Boyd, thank you.
1911	1915	Right now?
1916	1920	Don't do it.
1924	1927	Bye.
1934	1938	We'll see you all again. Sleep tight.
1941	1944	Let's see how they do without us.
1956	1959	Thank you.
1959	1965	- You will have a medical program? - Oh, sure.
1966	1969	I don't know...
1970	1975	Don't panic. We're gonna be okay.
1975	1980	We're gonna be great. We're gonna be... great.
2013	2018	- I wonder what he said. - My aunt is hearing impaired.
2018	2023	He just said, "You complete me".
2042	2049	To support one another, we've got to listen to one another.
2049	2055	Women are taught not to see each other as good people.
2055	2059	We see each other as enemies. We compete over men.
2059	2064	- It's true, It's terrible. - I used to hate women.
2065	2069	Now I've met you guys, and you're like me.
2069	2073	It's important because you can be my friends.
2073	2077	- What about medical? - Of course.
2077	2080	Single parents can't be frivolous.
2080	2085	If you had read what he wrote, you'd have left, too.
2085	2091	Do you know those child exams cost $150, and that's if he's well.
2091	2095	- Where is Ray? - Asleep in the living room.
2095	2102	Don't leave my little boy alone with your divorced women's group.
2102	2107	I've finally got in touch with my anger.
2115	2119	What did I do?
2119	2123	Function, function... Forward motion is everything.
2123	2126	Cush saves all.
2126	2130	Go to Texas. Keep one star, and they'll all follow.
2130	2135	There's no real loyalty. You told me that yourself.
2136	2139	- I was trying to sleep with you. - Well, it worked.
2140	2146	I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Maguire!
2146	2150	King of the house calls. Master of the living room.
2150	2155	- Okay, this is working. - You are not a loser.
2157	2163	- Who mentioned losing? - Wrong word! When can you leave?
2191	2196	- Matt? - I'm in the back, Jerry.
2196	2199	Would you like a bloody beer?
2199	2204	- Beer and tomato juice. - I'm fine.
2204	2209	We've spent a lot of time together, and you know I care about your son.
2210	2214	I'm concerned that if you stay with SMI...
2214	2218	We've decided to stay with you.
2223	2229	I'm not really a hugger. I can't let go.
2229	2234	I told myself if he shows up, we stick with him.
2235	2239	- Hey, Jerry. How's it going? - Hey, Cush.
2239	2244	- How are you? - You remember Keith.
2244	2249	He must go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
2249	2252	It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
2253	2259	- I'll either surf or ski. - Denver's where he should be.
2259	2265	You know I don't do contracts, but what you do have ls my word.
2266	2270	And it's stronger than oak.
2319	2322	- Hello. - Jerry Maguire.
2322	2327	- Is Avery there? - She has an NFL meeting in Atlanta.
2330	2336	- Hello? - My son's here with the nanny.
2336	2341	- In our office? - Nanny? I prefer child technician.
2341	2349	- I came home to work here. - Fine. Dorothy, we are backl
2349	2355	We are so very, very back. I resigned Cush. We're set.
2355	2360	- I am so happy for you. - Happy for us.
2360	2362	Happy for us.
2362	2369	Rod, being at the draft will help. Get on the plane and meet us there.
2369	2372	Good. See you there.
2373	2376	Avery will be at the B-gate at 4:15.
2376	2381	Do you know the human head weighs eight pounds?
2381	2387	Troy Aikman, in only six years, has passed for 16,303 yards.
2387	2395	- Bees and dogs can smell fear. - I've booked Tidwell at the Mariot.
2395	2401	Pete Rose made 4,256 hits and he's not in the Hall of Fame.
2401	2407	Did you know that my neighbour has three rabbits?
2407	2411	I can't compete with that.
2411	2414	- Did we go over everything? - Yep.
2414	2418	- Back on Tuesday, right? - Yeah.
2420	2424	- Ray, wish me luck. - Good luck!
2444	2448	- Hey, Rod, you made it. - Jerry...
2449	2455	- Hi, Cush. - We should be selling these.
2455	2461	This is my agent, you might want to get his autograph.
2461	2465	- Excuse me... - Are you Hootie?
2465	2471	No, I'm not Hootie.
2475	2479	Is it gonna be San Diego or Denver?
2485	2488	He'll either surf or ski.
2494	2498	Rod, at last I find you.
2498	2503	What am I doing here, Jerry? This ain't my party.
2503	2508	- Nobody gives a damn about me. - Let's walk through the lobby.
2508	2514	I want the media and the reps to see you for what you are:
2514	2518	The best-kept secret in the NFL.
2518	2523	You are the wide - receiver. You're fast, fierce and charismatic.
2523	2526	You are the man! Ready?
2526	2533	Let's go. The fiercest. You are the man.
2533	2538	- Let's do it. - Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom.
2538	2544	It's a good thing you were able to hold onto Cushman.
2544	2549	I want you to meet Rod Tidwell, 110 catches, 1,550 yards last year.
2583	2588	I came all that way just to walk the lobby.
2588	2594	- It might have even worked, too. - Yeah? Let's do it again.
2595	2600	See the Reebok-ad down there. Where are my endorsements?
2600	2605	No love from Chevy, no love from Pepsi...
2605	2609	I ain't gettin' no love from Nike.
2609	2613	Did I ever tell you about my Reebok story?
2614	2619	- I've got to get back to Cushman. - Oh, your golden paycheck.
2619	2623	I'll boil it down for you. Fuck Reebok!
2624	2629	All they do is ignore me. Always have.
2629	2636	For a moment down there, you got that chip off your shoulder.
2636	2642	You let people in. You were brilliant.
2643	2646	- Really? - Brilliant.
2646	2650	- See you tomorrow. - You're loving me now.
2650	2653	I'm showing you the money!
2653	2660	I was just testing you, but to hear you say that makes me love you.
2660	2665	Jerry, come back.
2665	2668	- How was your flight? - Good.
2668	2675	If you can find your size, grab some of those shoes by the door.
2681	2686	Cush, Matt, we have a decision to make.
2686	2691	San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big.
2691	2697	- He's got to go number one. - San Diego wants him bad.
2697	2703	- What happened to Denver? - Before a draft, people get crazy.
2703	2709	San Diego is offering seven years for 30. Signing bonus of 8.
2709	2713	- Should I unplug the phone? - Damn reporters.
2713	2717	You just say, "No comment".
2717	2721	I'm no good at talking and saying nothing.
2721	2724	Let me.
2724	2729	For you, it's a pleasure. This is Cush.
2729	2734	It's Sugar. Is Maguire there? Sniff if he is.
2734	2742	You're in with the big boys now. I got you the deal you needed.
2742	2749	This is business, not friendship. You've got to be strong.
2749	2753	Okay, buddy? See you later.
2757	2760	No comment.
2765	2768	- He's got it all wrong. - You're on TV again.
2769	2771	I'm sick of me.
2783	2788	Before I go back to Denver, let's put something down on paper.
2788	2795	- A contract with Jerry Maguire. - Not right now, Jerry.
2800	2805	Do I know everything there is to know here, Matt?
2807	2810	You're not talklng with Bob Sugar?
2810	2818	- Denver would only deal with him. - Said who? Sugar?
2818	2825	- I'm learning as I go here. - You let him deal behind my back?
2825	2831	I'm sorry... I love my son.
2831	2838	I love your son! I brought Denver to 20 million.
2838	2843	You listened to Bob Sugar? That is a child.
2843	2848	You let that snake in the door?
2849	2855	Okay, listen, rookie mistake. I'll fix this Denver thing for you.
2856	2860	You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right?
2861	2865	Matt...? Tell me you didn't sign.
2865	2872	What happened to your "my word is stronger than oak" thing?
2875	2879	We signed an hour ago.
2879	2883	You were in the lobby with the black fella.
2885	2890	Sorry, Jerry. I just want to play football.
2892	2897	- How do I spin this? - Honey, it's spun!
2897	2901	- What did I do to you? - It's all about you, isn't it?
2901	2907	"Soothe me, save me, love me." I have to finish my job.
2907	2913	- Everything is on the run with us. - We are salespeople. We sell.
2913	2920	It's not trust my handshake, it's make the sale! Get it signed.
2920	2925	- Welcome to my nightmare. - Is honesty outlawed here?
2926	2933	- I would prefer loyalty. - Our deal was the brutal truth.
2933	2937	I think you added the "brutal".
2937	2942	There is a sensitivity thing that some people have. I don't have it.
2942	2948	I don't cry at movies, or gush over babies.
2948	2954	And I don't tell a man who just screwed up, "Oh, poor baby."
2955	2959	But I do love you.
2962	2966	- Avery, it's over. - I didn't hear it.
2966	2970	- There's something missing. - You've never been alone.
2970	2974	- You can't be alone. - It's over.
2977	2984	- No one has ever dumped me. - I'm not trying to make history.
2984	2992	I climbed El Capitan in 18 hours and 23 minutes. I can make this work.
2995	2999	No.
2999	3001	Oh, Jerry . ..
3009	3013	I didn't ever want to hurt you.
3021	3028	I won't let you hurt me, Jerry. I'm too strong for you. Loser!
3032	3036	Roll with the punches . Tomorrow's another day.
3037	3042	- Taxi ! - You're loving me now, aren't you?
3042	3045	Very much. Taxi!
3045	3049	Didn't we arrive in a limo?
3049	3054	I hope I don't sound too much like a shrink here, but...
3055	3060	- What's wrong? - I'm just a big disappointment.
3060	3064	Everybody cries on this show.
3065	3068	If you've tested positive, quit doing blow.
3069	3074	Upset about your baby girl. Why did you leave her mother?
3074	3079	The media don't understand the pressures $54 million comes with.
3079	3084	- This is some bullshit. - What are you doing wlth me, Rod?
3085	3090	- What? - Don't you even see? I'm finished.
3090	3096	I am fucked! 24 hours ago... I was hot!
3097	3100	Now, I'm a cautionary tale.
3100	3107	You see this jacket I'm wearing? I don't need it. I'm a failure!
3107	3112	I lost the number-one draft pick! Why? Let's recap.
3112	3117	Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a jerk.
3117	3121	I ate some bad pizza, went to bed and grew a conscience!
3121	3127	Boo-fucking-hoo!
3128	3136	I've got ten years, tops. My next contract has got to be a big one.
3136	3145	I could be out in five years. What's my family gonna live on?
3145	3152	I don't want to hear your shit. "I lost Cush and Avery..."
3152	3155	A drink, please.
3155	3162	Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you.
3162	3169	I'm gonna ride your ass like Zorro till you show me the money.
3171	3176	We're together on this. You hear me? We're gonna be one.
3178	3183	- The both of us... you know? - My God!
3187	3190	You have no messages.
3216	3221	He's coming over. He just lost his best client.
3221	3226	This is not a guy. It's a syndrome.
3226	3231	It's early mid-life, don't-let-me-be-alone syndrome.
3231	3236	- But, if that's what you want... - He's engaged.
3236	3241	And for the first time, I'm part of something I believe in.
3241	3245	Okay... but he better not be good-looking.
3247	3252	Hi... I'm Jerry Maguire.
3252	3258	Hello. You're just the way I pictured you.
3258	3263	- I'm her disapproving sister. - Honesty.
3264	3266	Thank you.
3267	3271	Thank you. Dorothy!
3272	3276	Dorothy, your... boss is here.
3276	3279	Hello.
3282	3287	- Hey, you. - Thanks for inviting me over.
3287	3292	- Where's the little guy? - He's sleeping.
3295	3300	I'm so glad you're home. Being alone is not my specialty.
3301	3305	- My God! - Yeah.
3305	3311	Well, I broke up with Avery.
3315	3320	- That's too bad. - No, it's for the best.
3320	3325	We'll still be friends. It's better now than later.
3325	3332	- I'm dying here, aren't I? - Yeah, it's a reaily bad cut.
3332	3337	Just think if I had got her the ring she really wanted.
3341	3344	Why don't you have a seat?
3344	3350	I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.
3350	3354	- Do you have something to drink? - Sure.
3360	3365	- I heard. - I saw your shoes under the door.
3366	3370	This guy is looking for anyone who'll show interest.
3371	3375	Don't use those. Use the frosted glasses.
3375	3379	- I warmed up some chicken. - I love you.
3380	3383	I won't say any more, but what about Ray?
3383	3388	He shouldn't hear a strange man's voice in the house.
3388	3394	- A drunken man's voice. - What about ten angry women?
3394	3397	Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.
3397	3401	It's still edible. Change your shirt.
3407	3410	Hi, Jerry.
3410	3415	Hi, Ray, aren't you supposed to be in bed?
3415	3422	- Yeah. - Don't worry, I won't tell.
3422	3428	The human head weighs eight pounds.
3437	3442	- Jerry Maguire. - I think it's this one.
3442	3448	You should be dreaming about me. Think about me constantly.
3448	3452	That's when the big dollars are gonna flow.
3452	3457	- Who is this? - Rod Tidwell. Where's my agent?
3457	3462	- My agent and I should be one. - Are you a football player?
3462	3468	A football player? I'm a school teacher about to womp your ass!
3469	3474	I won't say anything else, but you just can't fall for a drowning man.
3474	3478	Which top? Turtle neck, sensible. V-neck, sexy.
3479	3483	What are other women my age doing right now?
3483	3487	They're out partying trying to get a man.
3487	3491	Trying to keep a man. Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.
3491	3497	This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day reminder of Roger for my whole life.
3497	3502	I've had three lovers in four years.
3502	3508	All of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath.
3508	3512	I'm the oldest 26-year-old around. How do I look?
3512	3515	- Good. - Yeah? Thanks.
3515	3520	72% of new buyers are African-American.
3520	3524	- You talk too much. - It is a form of communication.
3524	3529	- It was fun talking to you, Rod. - Jerry...!
3529	3533	I'll make you a ham sandwich.
3533	3538	- I'm glad you listen to me. - Well, I love you.
3538	3544	When my dad retired from the United Way after 38 years, he said:
3545	3550	"I wish they'd given me a more comfortable chair."
3550	3556	When my dad died, my mom took me to the zoo and I loved it.
3556	3564	- Let me tell you about my dad. - No, let's go to the zoo.
3564	3568	Okay, you're right.
3568	3574	My whole life I've been trying to talk... really talk.
3574	3579	But no one wants to listen. You know that feeling?
3579	3583	- They just look at you... - Let's go to the zoo, right now.
3583	3590	The zoo... the fucking zoo's closed, Ray.
3591	3596	- You said "fuck". - Yeah, I did.
3597	3601	- Is that...? - I won't tell.
3601	3608	Well... then I'm gonna have to take you to the zoo.
3608	3613	I've got to go to bed, my mom's coming in.
3614	3621	- I've got to go to bed. - Thanks for listening.
3621	3629	Okay. Drinks, food, and I called you a cab.
3629	3635	- Good idea. - Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.
3637	3641	Our company!
3643	3648	A little speech before I go.
3653	3658	Do not worry about your future.
3658	3664	You and your son are just fine. You still have a job.
3665	3671	But let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire.
3671	3676	You come after me, and you will lose.
3676	3681	I am a survivor.
3681	3687	Dorothy Boyd, you are with the Lord of the Living Room.
3687	3693	The King of the Kingdom and I am ...
3696	3699	...drunk.
3707	3710	We meet again.
3724	3726	Here.
3734	3738	- Truth? - Sure.
3739	3743	I care about the job, of course.
3743	3748	But mostly, I just want to be inspired.
3748	3755	- Me, too. - What you wrote inspired me.
3755	3760	I'm working with you because of that memo.
3760	3764	I loved that memo.
3766	3770	It was a mission statement.
3781	3788	- Well .. . - Sorry about the hand.
3790	3793	You know that feeling?
3794	3800	You're not completely embarrassed, but you know tomorrow you will be?
3801	3807	- Don't worry about it, boss. - Shit, you said "boss".
3807	3813	- Yeah, I did. - Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
3813	3815	I do.
3815	3820	- I'm harassing you right now. - Well, I may not sue.
3833	3838	- Good evening. - Good evening.
3839	3843	Don't worry.
3843	3851	I am going to take my one client, and we are gonna go all the way.
3853	3857	Because... I'm back.
3858	3863	Don't worry.
3877	3879	Good catch.
3887	3892	- He needs a contract, Dennis. - I'll be at The Crocodile at eight.
3894	3896	You bet.
3916	3920	What happened last night? I thought I was your friend.
3920	3925	- Something came up. - Okay. $10 million for four years.
3925	3928	- You're dreaming. - Ten for four.
3928	3934	- He's got an attitude problem. - He listens to me.
3934	3939	- He's a shrimp. - He broke all records last year.
3939	3943	I want a prototypical wide-receiver. 6'3", 220 lbs.
3943	3947	Not some shrimp who bitches.
3947	3953	Dennis, I'm asking you... for a favour.
3953	3959	I introduced you to your wife. We've spent Christmas together.
3959	3963	- Holiday cheer. - Jerry, you're reaching.
3963	3968	I'm asking you for a favour. We have history, Dennis.
3968	3973	We got history. You drove the prices up.
3973	3977	- Now it's your turn to suffer. - Dennis, don't...
3983	3990	I talked with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotiation.
3992	3994	Talking?
3994	4000	Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter, I smoked them all!
4000	4007	Yet they're making the big dollars, the kwan... and you're talking.
4011	4015	- Kwan? That's your word? - Yeah, that's my word.
4015	4021	Some dudes might have the coin, but they'll never have the kwan.
4021	4026	It means love, respect, community, and dollars, the entire package...
4027	4030	...the kwan.
4030	4038	- Great word... towel? - No, I air-dry.
4038	4044	Listen, Rod... I say this with great respect for you.
4045	4050	But those players you mentioned, are marquee players.
4050	4054	- This deal... - Marquee?
4055	4062	This is a renegotiation. Show them your joy for the game.
4062	4067	Bury the attitude a little bit, and show them...
4067	4071	- You're telling me to dance. - No.
4071	4076	Get back to the guy who first started playing this game.
4076	4081	Way back when you were a kid, was it just about the money?
4081	4085	Was it? Was it...?
4087	4093	Do your job. Don't you tell me to dance.
4093	4098	I am an athlete. I am not an entertainer!
4098	4104	I do not dance and I do not start pre-season without a contract!
4104	4109	- Fine, fine, fine! - Jerry, talk to me.
4109	4112	Breathe, Jerry.
4114	4120	I am out here for you. You don't know what that's like.
4120	4124	It's an up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege -
4125	4129	- that I will never fully tell you about, okay?
4132	4135	God, help me.
4135	4142	Help me. Help me... help you.
4142	4146	Help me help you.
4153	4155	I'm sorry.
4156	4160	You are hanging on by a very thin thread.
4161	4164	I dig that about you.
4165	4169	No contract! Help me? I'll help everybody.
4169	4174	- That's my man. - Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.
4174	4179	- Help me! - See you in Los Angeles.
4179	4182	Jerry... come on, man.
4183	4189	We ain't fighting, we're finally talking.
4194	4198	Unless you love everybody, you can't sell anybody.
4208	4213	Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer for Tidwell on Thursday morning.
4213	4217	- He said you'd be happy... glad. - Happy or glad?
4219	4222	Glad. He said glad.
4222	4228	- Glad is good. - We could sure use that commission.
4228	4233	I did a rundown on where you stand financially.
4235	4240	- My condo was devalued. - You don't have to explain.
4241	4244	The other night... I apologize.
4244	4250	- Yeah, what happened there? - This is a working relationship.
4250	4252	Exactly.
4252	4258	The other night I was lonely. I felt you understood something.
4258	4265	We've got a company to think about, and I'll never try that again.
4266	4271	You walked out on a job for me... Can this be right?
4271	4275	Exactly.
4275	4280	I know right now you need to be alone with your thoughts.
4280	4285	Find out what's gone wrong and fix it .. . alone.
4285	4292	Alone! Alone, alone.
4293	4297	- You want to go out to dinner? - Great!
4297	4302	I broke up with that loser, and then he started stalking me.
4302	4310	- What do you mean by stalking? - Coming over uninvited.
4322	4326	Excuse me... Ladies.
4326	4331	Good evening, I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.
4331	4337	- She's in the kitchen. - Laurel... Hello.
4337	4342	- Where are you taking her tonight? - You're the nanny?
4342	4345	- Au pair. - Au pair?
4346	4350	Jerry!
4351	4354	He likes you.
4354	4361	Ray, I've got some gifts for you. Do you like presents?
4361	4366	Arizona Cardinals. It's the team Rod plays for.
4366	4371	- Is that your laundry? - Would you like a Steelers hat?
4371	4377	- I've got it in grey, too. - Thanks, Jerry.
4377	4382	And I've got an energy bar. This will keep you up all night.
4383	4387	That's not a good idea. I'll take that.
4389	4393	Hey, it looks like you've got a fan.
4395	4399	That's more than a dress, that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
4399	4405	I got a bit revved up at the thought of an evening among adults.
4405	4410	- Jerry, Chad. Chad, Jerry. - Yeah... Am I dressed okay?
4414	4421	- Don't let him stay up too late. - Tonight he'll learn about jazz.
4421	4425	Good, that'll put him to sleep early.
4425	4428	I want to go too.
4428	4433	No, you stay here with Chad and be good. Kiss me.
4434	4436	Let's go.
4438	4442	- Good night. - Give me a hug.
4484	4489	- I'll meet you at the car. - You forgot your keys.
4489	4493	Ray kissed him just like a dad!
4494	4498	Wasn't that thrilling? He must have been needing that.
4499	4504	Don't cry at the start of a date, just cry at the end, like I do.
4504	4508	Don't be a shoulder for him to cry on, either.
4508	4514	Keys. Oh dear...
4539	4546	Ever since you've met me, I've been...
4548	4552	It was laziness, my breakup with Avery.
4552	4557	It doesn't just happen. Somebody is always to blame.
4557	4561	You work at it like you do a job.
4562	4567	Maybe, love shouldn't be such hard work.
4567	4570	Yeah, maybe so.
4570	4576	But it's not every day you say goodbye to a woman like that.
4578	4581	A song for the lovers?
4581	4587	- No, no, we work together. - This is like an office meeting.
4587	4590	I know what you mean.
4590	4597	It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was any good, even before ...
4597	4601	Before...?
4602	4607	Jerry... Let's not tell our sad stories.
4612	4616	I'll be back in just a second, okay?
4646	4649	They sting. Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.
4649	4654	He won't hurt him. You've got such a good heart.
4683	4689	- Well, this would be goodnight. - Goodnight.
4689	4694	I'll see you tomorrow. It's a big day.
4718	4723	- Well, goodnight. - Goodnight.
4761	4766	- Let me fix this. - Good idea.
4819	4823	I think you should not come in.
4823	4828	Or... come in.
4828	4833	- Depending on how you feel. - The same to you.
4833	4841	No, I have to go in. I live here.
4849	4852	Right.
4855	4859	I'll come in.
4859	4862	Good.
4870	4873	Are you sure we want to do this?
4876	4878	Hell, yes!
4888	4892	- Did he have a good night? - Yeah, he's asleep.
4892	4897	- How did it go with sport-boy? - Still going.
4897	4899	All right.
4903	4906	Chad... how are you?
4909	4912	- Treat her right. - Yeah...
4915	4917	She's great.
4920	4927	I know this might be awkward, but I want you to use this.
4927	4930	God, Chad...
4930	4935	This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane.
4935	4938	Stockholm 1963.
4938	4944	Two masters of freedom, playing before their art was corrupted -
4944	4953	- by cocktail-lounge performers who destroyed this American legacy.
4953	4956	Jazz.
4957	4961	I've put some Mingus on there, too.
4967	4973	- No barriers, no boundaries... - Chad, I got it.
5026	5032	You know this is gonna change everything.
5032	5035	Promise?
5040	5045	What is this muslc?
5077	5083	I love getting up in the morning and beginning another great day!
5086	5092	Great! Did you really need to do this?
5103	5110	- I'm getting him up, don't worry. - What? I'm just waiting for coffee.
5110	5115	- Just tell me one thing. - No.
5116	5123	I'm worried this guy may not have an emotional marble in his head.
5123	5129	Laurel, if I start talking . .. I took a chance, all right?
5129	5135	- This guy's on the bottom rung. - Maybe I am taking advantage.
5135	5138	Does that make me a bad person?
5138	5144	Roger was popular and charming, and not so nice to me, and he died.
5144	5151	Why should I let this guy go when my body tells me that he's the one?
5152	5158	- I just wanted the fun details. - Why didn't you say so?
5158	5165	Well, you might be interested in this one little detail...
5167	5170	I love him.
5171	5175	I do! I love him, and I don't care what you think.
5175	5182	I love him for the man he wants to be, and for the man he almost is.
5182	5187	I love him, Laurel. I love him.
5187	5190	Hi, Jerry.
5191	5195	Act natural.
5199	5204	- Tell me he's not there. - He's not there.
5204	5208	- Easy, ladies. - Coffee, Jerry?
5208	5214	No, thanks. We bottom feeders prefer cereal first.
5214	5218	- Let's have Apple Jacks. - Apple Jacks it is.
5218	5222	Dorothy... good morning, darling.
5225	5228	- Good morning. - What's going on?
5229	5235	A lot. We've got a big fax. We need this commission.
5235	5239	Milk? Cheers.
5247	5251	That was really great of you, this morning.
5251	5259	Let's just root for a big offer so we can move into a real office.
5259	5263	Would you mind? Thanks a lot.
5270	5273	Shit!
5277	5282	1.7 for three years? We owe more than that!
5282	5288	- I'll get back to them. - They're fucking us in the ass!
5288	5291	I'm sorry, I'm a little pregnant right now.
5292	5298	- I feel like crying, Jerry. - Don't take this so emotionally.
5298	5302	- We'll roll with the problem. - Why are you so calm?
5302	5310	"Don't take it emotionally?" You need to get emotional.
5310	5314	- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone. - Marcee...
5315	5320	- You want to leave me? - What exactly do you stand for?
5320	5324	- What do you stand for? - How about integrity?
5325	5330	There's so much greed in the world I don't know what to tell my son!
5330	5335	But this guy isn't yelling, "Show me the money!"
5335	5340	Do you know he's broke and working for you for free?
5341	5344	Broke! Broke, broke, broke.
5345	5350	- Sorry, I'm not so good at insults. - That was pretty good.
5353	5356	Let me show you something.
5359	5364	- Here. Rod, read this. - No, no, no...
5364	5368	This is important, Jerry.
5368	5373	- I appreciate this, but... - You should be proud of that.
5373	5380	Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.
5381	5388	Tell me if this is the best we can get... He's my agent.
5388	5394	I'll tell you what you're gonna do. Reject that shitty contract.
5394	5400	Play out your existing contract, and next year you're a free agent.
5400	5406	Baby, this is us. You and me. We determine our worth.
5406	5412	You are a strong, proud, surviving, splendid black man.
5414	5419	Marcee... you are the shit.
5427	5432	- If you get injured, you get zero. - It won't happen.
5433	5437	Rod, it's a risk.
5437	5442	You bet on me, like I bet on you.
5446	5450	You know?
5453	5457	You know, baby?
5457	5460	- You're so crazy .. . - I love you, baby.
5461	5466	- Let me kiss that head. - Thank you.
5473	5478	I'm taking that job in San Diego. You can't afford me.
5478	5484	- You can't afford me. - I'll find something for Tidwell.
5484	5488	- I refuse to be a drain. - We'll stay afloat.
5488	5492	We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.
5493	5497	- Rod, get on the camel. - You've been on my ass all day.
5497	5501	- He's my client. - Get him on the camel.
5501	5505	- We don't need a camel. - It's a Camel Chevrolet.
5506	5510	- See? He's feeling my pain! - Get on the camel.
5510	5515	- I'm pulling him from this. - Just get rid of the camel.
5515	5520	- This isn't what I had in mind. - Right, let's bounce.
5522	5527	Pulling him? You begged me to hire him.
5527	5535	I know you needed that commission, but this isn't exactly Reebok.
5535	5540	- Can I ask you a personal question? - Are we gonna be friends now?
5541	5546	- Have you dated any single mothers? - I was raised by a single mother.
5546	5551	I think, after this, she's gonna have to take that job in San Diego.
5551	5556	First of all, single mothers don't date.
5556	5564	They've been to the puppet show and they've seen the strings.
5564	5569	Do you love her...? Don't tell me you don't know.
5569	5574	I don't want her to go. We've been hanging out a lot.
5574	5579	That's bullshit! You've got to be fair to her.
5579	5585	Single mothers are a sacred thing. You've got to have the talk.
5585	5591	She loves you. If you don't love her, you've got to tell her.
5593	5597	The kid's amazing. He...
5599	5602	I feel you...
5602	5607	But a real man wouldn't shoplift the pooty from a single mother.
5607	5613	I didn't shoplift the pooty.
5616	5621	All right, I shoplifted the pooty.
5629	5634	You know, John Coltrane once said to Miles Davis...
5635	5640	When you say goodbye to him, just be cool. What's meant to be will be.
5640	5646	You'll see each other. I'm losing the only person who listens to me.
5646	5650	- Seriously. - You're doing the right thing.
5650	5655	You need to start your life, not cushion the fall for him.
5659	5663	I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.
5667	5671	Bye.
5676	5681	Listen, you're gonna like it in San Diego, Ray.
5681	5684	Ray...
5684	5688	It's gonna be great there. You'll make a lot of friends.
5689	5695	- I'll see you this weekend. - Go ahead and go.
5699	5702	Go ahead and go.
5712	5716	- Are you okay to drive this? - This rig? No problem.
5716	5721	- I'll see you this weekend. - Get in the car.
5722	5726	I'll see you in a couple of days... and I love you.
5728	5732	I love you, too... What?
5733	5736	- Nothing. - I'll see you soon.
5736	5741	Look, if this weekend should turn into next month, -
5741	5747	- and next month into whatever, don't make a joke of your life.
5747	5750	Go back and read what you wrote.
5750	5756	You're better than the Bob Sugars. Don't forget that.
5773	5777	- Wait a second. - No! Oh, God.
5778	5783	- We can save on medical... - Don't listen to him, Dorothy.
5784	5789	What if we stay together? What if we got married?
5789	5794	- Would you stay? - No, don't do that. Don't say that.
5794	5798	Well... say it if you want to.
5803	5807	Will you marry me?
5811	5815	What are you thinking?
5845	5851	Laurel! We're getting married.
5851	5857	Do you, Jerry Magulre, take this woman to be your wife?
5857	5864	And do you, Dorothy Boyd, take this man to be your husband?
5865	5870	I now pronounce you husband and wife.
5909	5912	I should go.
5931	5934	We did it.
5934	5938	We sure did.
5955	5960	You fuck this up, I'll kill you.
5964	5967	I'm glad we had this talk.
5969	5973	Look at them.
5973	5978	She is so beautiful.
5992	5997	I don't believe they taped this.
6003	6008	I'm gonna release this to ESPN.
6008	6014	- You think I'm joking. - No, but I know where you live.
6016	6020	You didn't have the talk, did you?
6022	6024	No.
6025	6029	Well, this definitely was another way to go.
6029	6034	Hey, Dorothy, come here. Ladies and gentlemen...
6034	6040	Mr. and Mrs. Maguire. We're gonna have a great season.
6049	6054	Hey, Scotty. Tidwell did four for 36.
6054	6059	- Jerry... he's having a good game. - You bet he is.
6059	6062	You're gonna miss him next year.
6067	6071	I've got a great team behind me and I'm loving it.
6077	6083	- That's my mo-fo! - Come here.
6084	6090	Be the first man in the family not to say that, and we'll let you live.
6090	6093	Go kiss Daddy.
6103	6108	I saw you limping a little, after the first quarter...
6111	6116	I twisted my ankle.
6117	6121	That went well. Anybody else worth talking to?
6121	6123	Let's go.
6125	6129	- How's your head? - Terrible.
6130	6135	How you doing, Rod? Tough game.
6138	6144	That quarterback sucks. He's gonna get me killed.
6145	6152	My brains will be blown loose before you get me my 10 million.
6156	6162	You take care out on that field. You're my entire client roster.
6162	6166	- Go home to your wife. - What's that supposed to mean?
6166	6173	- What are you doing here? - Giving you personal attention.
6173	6176	- You don't want to go home. - What?
6176	6181	I'm just trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
6181	6185	The husband and wife thing, how is that?
6191	6197	- Not everyone has what you have. - Why did you get married?
6197	6201	- I'm just asking as a friend. - You want an answer?
6201	6205	Loyalty... she was loyal.
6210	6214	Everything... grew from there.
6215	6220	It just... grew from there.
6221	6225	- That's an answer? - That's the answer.
6226	6230	It's not sexy... but that's an answer.
6230	6237	"Tell him what he's won, Bob. A beautiful marriage!" Shit!
6237	6242	I'm happy to entertain you, as always, Rod.
6244	6250	I have a question for you. Are we really friends?
6250	6256	You know, friends can tell each other anything, right?
6256	6261	I'll tell you why you don't have your $10 million.
6261	6266	You play for the money. You play with your head, not your heart.
6267	6272	When you get on the field, it's all about what you didn't get.
6272	6278	Who's to blame. Who's got the contract you didn't get.
6278	6284	That is not what inspires people!
6285	6288	Shut up! Play the game from your heart.
6288	6293	Then I'll show you the kwan. And that's the truth!
6293	6299	Can you handle it? It's just a question from a friend.
6299	6305	When they call you "shrimp", I'm the one who defends you!
6305	6310	I don't want to be friends no more. And quit using that word kwan.
6311	6314	- I'll see you in L.A. - No heart?
6314	6319	I'm all heart, motherfucker!
6355	6362	- How many concussions has he had? - I can't get no respect.
6380	6385	I went to see this so-called black film the other day.
6385	6393	No more salt for you. The biggest game of the season is coming up.
6394	6400	20 minutes of coming attractions. All black films and all violent.
6400	6405	- Brothers shooting brothers .. . - I hate you going out alone.
6405	6411	- Oh, baby .. . - My Pisces queen.
6413	6417	I hate seeing movies without you.
6417	6423	I won't do it anymore, okay?
6430	6435	- Baby. - Baby!
6436	6439	- Now? - Baby now!
6440	6447	- Ray, it's time to go. - Do you take Visa? Take it!
6449	6456	What were you thinking tonight, watching them go through that?
6456	6463	I was thinking, "I hope he doesn't get injured."
6465	6470	Sometimes I can't tell at all what's going on in that head of yours.
6475	6482	- And I don't know your noises yet. - Well, when you wonder, ask me.
6482	6486	Okay, I will.
6486	6492	I thought I just did.
6494	6498	- Why do you love me? - Why do you love me?
6498	6503	- Jerry, can I come and watch TV? - Just for a few minutes.
6522	6527	- He's not going anywhere. - I know.
6527	6534	- Can we talk about somethlng else? - No, I'm incapable of small talk.
6534	6538	But that's why you love me, right?
6549	6555	I'm about personal attention. I'm available to you 24 hours a day.
6555	6560	I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow for Monday Night Football.
6561	6567	I can be in Indiana by 11:30 Tuesday morning.
6567	6574	I don't need an answer now. I'll call you tomorrow.
6574	6580	All right, thank you, Marilee.
6581	6586	Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.
6589	6593	- It's my fault. - What?
6594	6600	It's not fair to you, this whole thing.
6601	6607	Come here. Tell me, let me help.
6607	6613	I took advantage of you and I did it with the help of a kid.
6614	6619	I was just on some wild ride. I thought...
6619	6625	I thought I was in love enough for both of us.
6625	6633	I jumped at your proposal when it was still just hypothetical.
6634	6640	I did this, and at least I can do something about it now.
6640	6645	I'm not a guy who runs. I stick.
6647	6654	- I don't need you to stick. - What do you want? My soul?
6654	6660	- Why not? I deserve that. - What if I'm not built that way?
6662	6668	- I think we made a mistake. - What if it's true?
6669	6672	Great at friendship, bad at intimacy.
6673	6676	That's the theme of my bachelor film.
6677	6681	I know, I watched lt. I know it by heart.
6685	6689	- I don't like to give up. - Please...
6690	6695	My need to make the best of things, and your need to be responsible ...
6695	6701	If we don't do something now, we could lose ten years being polite.
6704	6709	Let's just call this next road trip what it really is:
6710	6713	A nice long break.
6720	6723	What about Ray?
6726	6730	Well, you'll be friends.
6730	6733	- Friends? - Yes.
6736	6743	- Of course you'll be friends. - I'll take him to the zoo.
6744	6753	- So this break is a breakup. - Come on, this isn't easy for me.
6753	6757	On the surface everything looks fine.
6757	6764	I've got this great guy, and he loves my kid.
6766	6769	And he sure does like me a lot.
6775	6779	And I can't live like that.
6781	6784	It's not how I'm built.
6817	6822	If this is empty, this doesn't matter.
6843	6848	It was just a mission statement.
6878	6883	Hey, Rod, how are you doing? How's it going?
6883	6885	Go.
6887	6891	- Where's your agent? - I don't know.
6891	6896	You belong with the big boys. You belong with the big money.
6896	6900	- You're Rod Tidwell! - Get away from my guy.
6900	6905	- I was just handling it. - Just go. Flee.
6905	6911	This is a nice moment for you. I'm gonna let you have it.
6911	6916	Give me a call, Rod. Say hi to Marcee.
6922	6928	- Thanks for coming. - I missed you.
6928	6932	What can I say? You're all I've got.
6934	6939	This is Frank Gifford in Tempe, Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium.
6939	6945	The Cardinals are still alive for a play-off spot.
6945	6951	The reason for that is the outstandlng play of Rod Tidwell.
6951	6957	The Dallas Cowboys are on a roll. They know they're in the play-offs.
6957	6962	If Arizona wins tonight and next week, -
6962	6968	- they'll make the play-offs for the flrst time in 21 years.
6968	6972	You'd better not mess up tonight.
6972	6977	What did I say? He's always nervous for televised games.
6977	6982	The Cowboys contlnue their mlssion on Monday Night Football.
6989	6995	Hey, Shannon. Great column this morning.
7009	7011	What a bruiser.
7012	7019	The Cardinals just refuse to go quietly into the desert night.
7019	7024	I'm just trying to be a little poetic.
7025	7029	A tough hit on Tidwell.
7029	7035	- I'd have made a touchdown. - That's his sixth catch tonlght.
7035	7039	A first down at the 19 yard line.
7039	7047	- Another savage hit on Tidwell. - They're really working Tidwell.
7047	7054	- What does Daddy always say? - It looks worse than it is.
7054	7059	- He's gonna kill himself. - Will you be quiet!
7059	7062	Two minutes to play. Dallas leading by three.
7063	7067	Second down and one, at the Dallas 11 yard line.
7069	7073	Down he goes for a slx yard loss.
7074	7076	Good move.
7076	7080	Swenson had too many men in that pattern.
7083	7088	90 razor, X-out on one, ready?
7090	7094	They had a chance there.
7094	7098	But from second and one they've gone to third and seven.
7099	7102	Dallas 17, Arizona 14.
7102	7108	Tidwell in motion. Moving back to his left.
7108	7114	Swenson puts one into the endzone. Tidwell Touchdown Cardinals!
7115	7120	Tidwell held onto the football, but he's still down on the ground.
7120	7125	He hit the ground hard, but managed to maintain control of the football.
7126	7130	- He's hurt, too. - He's not getting up.
7130	7135	- Look at the players' faces. - Get up, baby.
7135	7143	The trainer ls on the field. It was Tidwell's ninth catch of the night.
7152	7156	Can you hear me, Rod?
7163	7167	Commercial! Show me what's wrong with my husband.
7167	7170	I told you he was too small for the NFL.
7170	7175	- I'm just stating the truth. - Tee Pee, shut up!
7176	7181	Can't you be loyal to your brother? Get the hell out of my house!
7181	7185	Hello? Hold on. It's Jerry Maguire.
7186	7188	Punk!
7189	7196	- Jerry, I am freaking out. - Marcee, he's unconscious.
7196	7200	Just stay calm. I'll call you back.
7200	7203	There are good doctors here.
7204	7210	- I cannot stay calm. - Stay calm.
7210	7213	Your family needs you to stay calm.
7214	7220	My whole life is this family, and it does not work without him!
7220	7227	All eyes here at Sun Devil Stadium are focused on Rod Tidwell.
7228	7233	Just do whatever you can to get Rod to me.
7233	7237	Do whatever you can. Please, Jerry.
7238	7243	At a time like thls, you just hope his familly is not watching this.
7244	7248	It could be his neck. It could be his back.
7251	7255	Blink! Wake up!
7267	7271	Rod! Can you hear me?
7271	7276	Can you hear me? Do you know where you are?
7276	7280	The trainer is still trying to revive Tidwell.
7281	7285	- Rod...? - Let's get him off the field.
7285	7288	- No... - Get him off the field.
7288	7293	Wait, wait... Let me enjoy this for a minute.
7293	7299	We're looking for some movement. Is that his head coming up?
7299	7304	He's trying to get up. He is getting up.
7319	7324	- The whole stadium is standing. - He's up on his feet.
7353	7359	Here's a guy who's normally very truculent with the media.
7374	7380	Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.
7395	7399	- Congratulations, Jerry. - Thank you.
7400	7403	Congratulations.
7404	7408	Jerry... Maguire!
7412	7415	I know.
7435	7437	Where's Jerry?
7457	7461	- We did it. - You did it.
7462	7466	Why don't we have that kind of relationship?
7474	7478	Is that your phone or mine?
7480	7482	Dorothy?
7483	7486	Marcee... No, he's right here.
7492	7497	We did it. I love you so much!
7501	7504	I love you!
7508	7514	I love you, Tyson. How's the baby?
7531	7536	The problem is, like you were saying, the biorhythms.
7537	7545	The neural pathways are set, so it's hard for people to change.
7549	7556	I'm sorry, these stupid holidays are making me feel more divorced.
7556	7559	The songs, the chocolate...
7575	7578	I have a confession to make.
7579	7586	I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob-stories.
7586	7593	Maybe you're all correct. Men are the enemy.
7593	7598	But I still love the enemy.
7612	7615	Hello.
7616	7620	I'm looking for my wife.
7630	7634	Wait...
7642	7647	If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen.
7648	7653	I'm not letting you get rid of me. How about that?
7658	7664	This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.
7665	7668	And now, I just...
7680	7688	Tonight... our little company had a very big night.
7689	7693	A very, very big night.
7695	7700	But it wasn't complete.
7700	7706	It wasn't nearly close to being complete.
7706	7711	I couldn't share it with you.
7711	7714	I couldn't hear your voice.
7715	7718	I couldn't laugh about it with you.
7719	7723	I missed my... I missed my wife.
7739	7745	We live in a cynical world.
7745	7750	And we work in a business of tough competitors.
7759	7766	I love you. You... complete me.
7768	7773	- And I just... - Shut up!
7773	7780	You had me at "hello".
7791	7795	What a great discussion group.
7795	7800	Your father leaves home on Christmas Eve.
7800	7804	Your mother had to sweep up to pay your tuition.
7804	7812	Your brother lost a leg. You've had a pretty horrific life.
7812	7818	- I'm not gonna cry, Roy. - Well, I've got some good news.
7818	7824	I've got a contract here from the Arizona Cardinals. Four years.
7824	7830	$11.2 million and you'll get to play in your home state.
7830	7834	What do think of that?
7851	7856	I love everybody. I love my wife! Marcee!
7857	7861	I love my kids. Tyson and my new baby.
7861	7867	My older brother and my younger brother Tee Pee.
7867	7871	You're militant, but I love you.
7871	7877	- I love my teammates. - We only have a half-hour show.
7878	7885	Jerry... Congratulations. Good for you.
7885	7890	- Hi, Jerry, you remember Troy. - Yeah, we met in '93.
7890	7893	I enjoyed your memo.
7894	7898	- The Cardinals finally came around. - We're out of time.
7899	7902	Wait, I'm forgetting somebody.
7902	7907	Jerry Maguire, my agent.
7910	7914	You are my ambassador of kwan, man.
7914	7919	Rod, thank you... We'll be right back.
7923	7927	- How did you like the zoo, buddy? - It was great!
7933	7938	Hey, kid, throw the ball.
7950	7955	- Did you see? - Oh, no... Let's go.
7955	7960	What? He won't make the major leagues tomorrow.
7960	7968	But you can see he's got talent and I know the right people...
7981	7984	I don't have all the answers.
7985	7989	In life, I've failed as much as I've succeeded.
7990	7996	But I love my wife, I love life, and I wish you my kind of success.
