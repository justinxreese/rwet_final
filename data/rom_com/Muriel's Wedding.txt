80	83	Hey, I'm already taken, love.
84	86	- Who got it? - Muriel.
88	90	Looks like I'm next.
92	96	Cheryl. Cheryl! I can throw it again.
96	99	You can't do that. It went to her.
99	101	Muriel, throw it again.
102	105	What's the use of you having it, Muriel? No one's ever gonna marry you.
105	108	You've never even had a boyfriend.
108	112	Cheryl's been going with Shane for over six weeks. She's next.
112	115	Muriel, don't be selfish.
118	122	Sugar baby love
122	126	Sugar baby love
127	130	Keep your stupid bouquet!
130	133	Shane and I broke up last night!
134	136	Cheryl! Cheryl!
136	139	Now look what you've done. You didn't even buy a new dress.
139	143	- Yes, I did. - Cheryl!
143	147	Chook, I won't be a minute. Cheryl's upset. Cheryl!
147	151	- Leave me alone! - Yes, all lovers make
151	154	Make the same mistakes
154	158	As me and you
167	169	There you are. Now if you put this under your pillow,
169	171	you'll dream of your future husband.
175	178	- That's what they say. - We always meet at Mary Tate's.
186	190	G'day, Muriel. That's an eye-catchin' dress.
190	192	You got a minute?
192	196	How's your dad? Give him my card.
196	200	I want you to tell him that Leo Higgins reckons he's a great man...
200	202	the best council president this town's ever had.
202	204	- Will you do that for me? - What happened to your nose?
205	206	- What? - Nothing.
206	209	Sunburnt, that's all.
234	236	Oh, my God.
237	240	But we're friends. What?
240	242	- I love you. - Yeah, but you love Tania too.
249	252	- Chook. - What?
252	254	Shut the door!
270	274	Excuse me, sir. Move aside, miss. Can you step aside, please?
274	277	- Please tell me- - That's her.
277	280	Miss, we'd like to have a word to you about your dress.
280	283	- What's wrong with it? - You stole it. I saw you.
286	289	Give me your work number, and if she can't turn up a receipt...
289	291	I can call you for a statement.
291	294	Ask for Dianne, Senior Store Detective.
294	297	- Mind your head, please. - I'm so pleased.
297	300	I had the perfect arrest record until I lost her in boys wear.
300	302	How'd you know she'd be here?
302	305	I didn't. I'm the groom's cousin.
316	318	It's as good as approved. Well, no, it's not.
319	323	But it will be. Porpoise Spit Council backs me a hundred percent.
323	325	- Look, we'll talk about it at dinner tonight. - Around and around
326	328	- Yeah, me whole family. Penelope! - And around-
328	331	Do that somewhere else, will ya? Ask your mum to make a cup of tea!
332	334	Mom, make Dad a cup of tea.
339	342	Mom! Make Dad a cup of tea!
342	344	- Me too. - What?
346	349	Tea? Oh, yes.
354	356	- He got it! Look at that! - Oh, man.
356	359	Did you see that? That was unreal.
388	391	Muriel's back.
391	394	Muriel, did you steal this dress?
394	397	- No. - Where'd you get the money to buy it?
397	400	You haven't had a job in two years.
400	403	- Mum gave it to me. - Is this true?
403	407	Um, no, I don't think so.
407	410	Find the receipt. Go on!
413	415	What happens if she can't find it?
415	419	We'll have to contact the store and see if they want to press charges.
419	423	- You know who I am? - Yes, sir. Councillor Heslop.
423	426	- Who are you? - I'm Constable Saunders, and this is Constable Gillespie.
426	430	Saunders? You're not Graham Saunders' oldest boy, are you?
431	433	- Brad. - Young Brad.
433	437	I haven't seen you since you played fullback for the Porpoise Spit Giants!
437	440	How's your dad? How's he recovering from that stroke?
440	442	- He's better than he was. - You're terrible, Muriel.
442	445	How about a beer? Cold one before you go back to work?
445	447	- Betty. - Yes? What?
447	450	- Get the young fellas a beer. - Oh. Yes.
474	476	You can dance
476	479	You can jive
479	482	Having the time of your life
482	485	Ooh, see that girl
486	488	Watch that scene
488	492	Diggin' the dancing queen
499	502	Friday night and the lights are low
504	508	Looking out for a place to go
508	511	- Where they play the right music - See you, boys!
511	513	- Getting in the swing - See you, Bill.
513	516	You come to look for a king
519	523	Anybody could be that guy
523	527	Night is young and the music's high
530	534	I think he'll enjoy that. It's very good.
534	538	Oh, honey prawns! Yes! Yum!
538	542	Aw, look at that! You're a wonderful man, Charlie Chan.
542	544	- Thank you. - How's your uncle? - Very well.
544	547	I got his uncle out from China. Talked to the boys from Immigration.
547	551	Ian McKay and his blokes, they got his uncle out from China.
551	553	- This is a great man. - Charlie.
553	557	- This is Victor Keinosuke and his mate, uh, Akira. - How do you do?
557	559	They're building a resort at Wallum Beach...
560	563	and they might want a Chinese restaurant in it, so keep the food comin'.
563	566	- Please, please. - Thank you. Thank you.
566	569	It's all on the house. I got his uncle out from China.
569	572	You've done a lot for the people of this town, Bill.
572	574	- Who told you that? - You did.
574	578	Ah, well, um- I like helping out. Ran for state government once.
578	581	Joanie, stand up. Show 'em your shirt.
584	587	"Bill Heslop. You can't stop progress. "
587	592	- He lost. - Yeah, well, missed on the postal vote.
592	594	In a way, I'm glad I didn't get in.
594	596	I can do more for this place at grass roots level.
597	600	You know, high rise, malls, resorts.
600	605	Porpoise Spit Council believes in progress. Muriel.
606	609	When Victor was 19, he was a millionaire.
610	612	Muriel's on the dole.
612	615	So is Perry.
615	619	Well, I've got a job interview next week. An apprentice locksmith.
619	623	Oh, that sounds wonderful. Doesn't it, Bill?
625	628	A bit old for an apprentice, aren't you?
628	630	A bit old for everything!
630	632	After she failed high school...
633	635	I get her into a secretarial course run by a mate of mine.
635	640	$300 a term. Two years, $2,000.
641	644	- She comes out, she can't even type. - I could type.
644	646	Then I get her a job at me solicitor's.
646	650	After a month, Stevie Mason rings up and says he'll have to let her go...
650	652	'cause she can't type.
652	655	If I couldn't type, why did they give me my secretarial diploma?
655	658	Because I paid for it!
658	661	Sits around the house like a dead weight...
661	665	watching TV, sleeping all day, getting arrested at weddings!
665	667	You're useless.
669	671	You're all useless.
676	678	A bunch of useless no-hopers.
682	684	Bill! Bill!
685	687	- It's Deidre Chambers. - What a go!
687	688	- What a coincidence! - What a coincidence!
688	691	Deidre, pull up a chair. Penelope, shift out.
691	693	- Deidre, Victor Keinosuke and his mate Akira. - Hello. Hello.
694	696	All the way from China- Uh, Japan.
696	698	Deidre's a sales representative for Radiant Cosmetics.
699	703	- Beauty consultant, Bill. - Sorry. Beauty consultant.
703	705	"Sales representative" sounds so common.
705	709	I advise women on the right lipstick, base and eyeliner.
709	713	Of course, you'd know all about make-up. Your wives are probably geishas.
715	716	You look lovely, Deidre.
716	719	Muriel, how was that wedding?
719	723	- She was arrested. - That's lovely.
723	726	Don't you wish you were 22 again, Betty?
726	729	Remember that age?
729	731	Oh, yes. What?
731	734	I bet you were a terror when you were 22.
734	736	Bill, was she a terror?
737	739	Where's Charlie Chan with that food?
739	742	Oh, yes, where is he?
743	746	Anyone? Oh, wait. I think we've got a winner over here.
746	748	Two new bars through there.
748	750	Here she comes. Give her a bit of a hand.
759	763	Your dad was telling me you're unemployed, Muriel.
765	768	Would you like to work for me?
785	788	- What's wrong? - What's the matter?
788	790	Yeah, tell us. We won't tell anyone.
799	802	Hello.
802	806	Don't bottle it up, Tania. You've got to let it out.
806	809	You can tell us what happened. We won't tell anyone.
815	819	He- He couldn't do it...
821	824	so I- you know.
825	828	And I noticed there was lipstick on it.
829	831	- On what? - His dick!
833	836	He said he was having an affair.
836	840	Who with?
840	844	- Rose Biggs. - Rose Biggs?
844	847	Well, he said they don't sleep together. She only sucks him off.
847	850	Why?
850	854	- Out of respect for me. - Bitch.
854	858	- Bastard. - What am I gonna do? I'm a bride!
858	861	I'm supposed to be euphoric!
862	864	Come on the holiday with us!
864	868	Cash in your ticket to Bali and have your honeymoon with us.
868	871	- Yeah. - Yeah, come on, Tan.
871	873	All right.
874	876	We are gonna have the best time. I'm so excited!
877	879	What holiday?
881	883	Just Hibiscus Island.
884	886	We didn't think that you could afford it because you don't have a job.
887	892	Yes, I do. I got one last night. I'm a beauty consultant.
892	895	Let's tell her. We were gonna tell her after the holiday...
895	897	but I think we should tell her now.
900	902	- Muriel- - Wait!
904	907	Let her finish her Orgasm.
928	931	Muriel, people think we're mad.
932	934	But that's just us. We're ragers.
934	938	People invite us to parties, and they know we'll just have a good time.
938	940	- We're mad. - Party, party, party.
941	944	That's our image. You know what I mean.
945	947	We're mad.
948	950	We don't want you hanging around us any more.
956	958	I didn't steal the dress. It was a mistake.
959	961	It's not the dress, it's you.
961	964	We've told you a thousand times how to do your hair, but you never listen.
964	967	- You never wear the right clothes. - You're fat.
967	971	You listen to '70s music. This is the '90s.
971	974	- We all listen to the Baby Animals. - And Nirvana.
974	978	- You bring us down, Muriel. - You embarrass us.
978	982	I, I know I'm not normal, but I'm trying to change.
982	984	I'm trying to become more like you, more of a-
985	987	- It's too late. - But I can change!
987	989	You'll still be you.
997	1003	Muriel, you've got to find friends on your own level.
1003	1007	Like I found Chook. He's up on my level.
1007	1012	Marrying him was the happiest day of my life.
1016	1018	I love him so much!
1022	1025	That bastard! I'll show him.
1025	1029	I'll go on this holiday and I'll sleep with a thousand men!
1029	1031	I'm not nothing.
1031	1035	Muriel, can't you think of anyone but yourself? Tania's upset.
1035	1037	I'm not nothing!
1037	1040	Well, nobody said that.
1040	1044	Oh, please don't chuck me out of the group!
1047	1052	Muriel. Muriel, you're embarrassing us again!
1060	1063	And Perry kicks! He picks it up!
1063	1066	"Go yourself! Go yourself!" is the roar from the crowd.
1066	1069	Heslop! Heslop! Heslop! Whoo!
1069	1074	How can a man be so strong and so fast? Heslop!
1074	1076	Perry!
1079	1081	Wake up to yourself!
1085	1089	And Heslop's made a comeback! How does he do it?
1089	1091	- Did he apply for the police force? - Yes, but they wouldn't let him sit for the test...
1092	1095	'cause he was too tall.
1095	1098	- Muriel up? - Muriel!
1098	1100	You've got to get up! It's nearly 10:30!
1100	1102	Make sure she sees Deidre Chambers about that job.
1102	1105	- Give her a blank cheque for the cosmetics. - A blank cheque? How much for?
1105	1108	It's a blank cheque. She fills in the amount when Deidre tells her what it is.
1108	1112	And tell Perry to mow that back yard. Clean the place up. It's a pigsty.
1112	1116	Joanie, will you turn off that television and clean this place up? It's a pigsty.
1117	1121	Muriel, you have to get up and go and see Deidre Chambers about that job.
1121	1124	- And I have to give you a blank cheque. - Have you seen my smokes?
1125	1127	It's wonderful for Deidre to give you work.
1127	1131	She's a wonderful person. I don't care what anyone else says.
1131	1136	- Mum? - What who says?
1136	1138	All those people who've never liked Dad.
1138	1141	Those greedies and those terrible women at the post office.
1141	1143	What are they saying?
1145	1149	Do I make this out to Deidre Chambers or Radiant Cosmetics?
1149	1154	A blank cheque. Cash.
1154	1158	What are they saying about Deidre and Dad?
1158	1161	They say that they go driving at night...
1161	1164	but he's only showing her his developments.
1165	1168	- His what? - His building sites.
1177	1180	I'm gonna be a success, Mum.
1180	1183	I'm gonna get married, and I'm gonna be a success.
1183	1188	I know you are. Your dad just wants to be proud of you, that's all.
1188	1193	I'll show him. I'll show them all.
1195	1198	And now, everybody a big round of applause as we welcome to the stage...
1198	1200	act three in Hibiscus Island Talent Quest.
1200	1204	The Tropical Delights! Let's hear it for the girls! Thank you!
1212	1217	The tide is high but I'm holding on
1217	1222	I'm gonna be your number one
1222	1229	I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
1229	1231	Oh, no, oh
1235	1237	- Hey, whose shout is it? - Cheryl's.
1237	1241	Cheryl's shout!
1241	1244	- Muriel! - Where did she get the money?
1256	1259	Hi. What a coincidence.
1261	1265	You're a mental case! You keep away from us!
1272	1275	You're got no dignity, Muriel.
1302	1304	- Are you Muriel Heslop? - No.
1307	1308	- Yes, you are. - Why?
1308	1310	I don't know why. You just are.
1310	1312	Rhonda Epinstall. We were in high school together.
1313	1316	You dropped out in year ten. I dropped out in year eleven.
1316	1318	Ha! I knew it was you!
1318	1321	- Hey, swap seats? - Yeah, indeed.
1321	1324	So, are you married now?
1325	1327	- What? - Well, you said you weren't Muriel Heslop.
1327	1329	If you changed your name, I thought you must have got married.
1329	1332	No. Yes.
1332	1335	- I'm engaged. - Anyone I know?
1335	1338	- What? Who? Tim. - Who? - What?
1338	1341	- Tim who? - Simms.
1341	1345	Tim Simms. Don't know him. What's he like?
1345	1350	- Um, like no one. - Smoke?
1350	1353	- What? - I shouldn't. I'm an asthmatic.
1354	1356	- So where is he? - Who?
1356	1358	Tim Simms.
1362	1364	I'm on to you.
1364	1366	You're not wearing an engagement ring.
1367	1369	You're here without your fiance.
1369	1372	You're out for a good time, aren't you, Muriel? A last fling?
1373	1375	I suppose so.
1375	1379	You are wicked! Well, stick with me, 'cause I'm wicked too.
1379	1383	My whole life is one last fling after another.
1383	1386	Hey, remember Tania Degano? She got married, to Chook.
1386	1389	- To what? - Chook. Peter Vernell.
1389	1394	Oh, I remember them. What a pair of assholes. They deserve each other.
1394	1397	Whenever I think about how revolting Porpoise Spit was...
1397	1401	I think about Tania Degano and those idiots that she used to hang out with.
1401	1403	They made my life hell.
1403	1409	Do you ever dream about what you would say to them if you saw them now?
1409	1412	I do see them now. They're over there.
1414	1418	- What are they doing here? - They're on Tania's honeymoon.
1418	1420	Chook couldn't come.
1423	1425	- No, I- - Tania!
1427	1430	What a fantastic surprise.
1430	1433	I don't believe it.
1433	1437	I haven't seen you since Porpoise Spit High.
1437	1439	- How are you? - Married.
1439	1441	Muriel told me!
1443	1445	- Turkey. - Chook.
1445	1449	Chook. That's right. Well, congratulations!
1453	1457	- Come and have a drink with us. - Yeah.
1457	1460	Really? You want to have a drink with me?
1461	1464	Well, we can't let you spend the entire holiday alone.
1464	1466	We're not in school any more, Rhonda.
1466	1469	You don't have to feel you're not good enough for us now.
1469	1475	- I don't. - If I feel you've changed, I'll tell you.
1475	1478	I'm honest, unlike some people.
1478	1480	- I tell it like it is. - The truth?
1481	1483	- Yes. - I tell the truth too.
1484	1486	Nicole's having an affair with Chook.
1487	1490	Muriel saw them fucking in the laundry on your wedding day.
1490	1492	Stick your drink up your ass, Tania.
1493	1496	I would rather swallow razor blades than drink with you.
1498	1503	Oh, by the way, I'm not alone. I'm with Muriel.
1508	1512	And now let's hear a warm welcome for act five in the Hibiscus Island star search.
1512	1515	- It's fabba ABBA! - My, my

1656	1659	Knowing my fate is to be with you
1666	1671	"Dear Dad, the girls and I are having a great time.
1671	1674	Last night I sold a hundred dollars worth of cosmetics...
1675	1679	to Barry Crocker. Muriel. "
1679	1682	A hundred dollars worth to Barry Crocker, eh? How about that.
1682	1686	P.S. I'm a fatso whale.
1686	1689	This cosmetic thing is the best thing that ever happened to Muriel.
1689	1692	It really is. She paid for this holiday herself.
1692	1695	Bought clothes to wear, new suitcases.
1695	1698	Perry, you listening to this? Eh?
1698	1701	- I said, "yeah. " - Well, so you should, you useless lump.
1701	1703	Muriel's out there, and she's made something of herself.
1703	1707	And she was the most useless one of all, wasn't she, Bill?
1707	1709	Ah, she really impressed me.
1709	1711	I told her that on the way to the airport for this holiday.
1711	1714	I said, "You've really impressed me.
1714	1717	You can't type, but you've really impressed me. "
1717	1721	You know what they call this great man? Bill the Battler.
1721	1725	'Cause he's a little Aussie battler.
1725	1729	- Been battling all me life. - Battlin' for Porpoise Spit.
1729	1733	Here's Deidre Chambers. What a coincidence.
1734	1737	- Deidre! Hey, Deidre! - Bill! Hello.
1737	1742	- What a coincidence. - Take a seat. Penelope, shift over.
1742	1745	Deidre, Leo Higgins.
1745	1747	He's concreting Wallum Beach for us.
1748	1752	- Hello, Leo. - Deidre got Muriel into this cosmetics thing.
1752	1756	Perry, show Deidre Muriel's postcard.
1756	1758	Hibiscus Island. How about that?
1761	1763	She should really be sending you postcards, Deidre.
1764	1766	You're the reason she's there.
1770	1773	- Bill. - I told you. I'm thinking about it.
1773	1775	Not that. It's Muriel.
1775	1779	In the past two weeks, she's bought two kits from me...
1779	1782	at a cost of $40 each.
1782	1785	If she'd sold both kits for the recommended price...
1785	1788	she'd make $110...
1788	1791	leaving her a profit of 30.
1792	1795	- Thirty dollars. - What are you talkin' about?
1795	1798	She's on a $3,000 holiday.
1798	1801	She's makin' a fortune.
1801	1803	Isn't she?
1808	1810	Do you think I could be famous?
1810	1814	Sure. For what?
1814	1818	Oh, I don't know. I could be an actress.
1818	1820	I'm mental enough.
1824	1826	My, my
1826	1830	At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
1830	1833	Oh, yeah
1838	1841	There was something in the air that night
1841	1844	The stars were bright
1844	1847	Fernando
1847	1851	They were shining there for you and me
1851	1856	For liberty, Fernando
1856	1860	Though we never thought that we could lose
1860	1863	There's no regrets
1863	1867	If I had to do the same again
1867	1870	I would, my friend
1870	1873	Fernando
1873	1877	If I had to do the same again
1877	1879	I would, my friend
1879	1881	Fernando
1890	1893	Do you ever think you're nothing?
1896	1901	Sometimes I think I'm nothing. Useless.
1902	1907	You're not nothing, Muriel. You're amazing.
1908	1911	Remember how you were in school?
1911	1914	You were so quiet you could hardly talk.
1914	1917	You were too shy to look at people.
1917	1922	Now you're a success, and someone wants to marry you.
1923	1926	You're not nothing, Muriel.
1928	1930	You've made it.
1949	1952	Can you hear the drums, Fernando
1954	1959	I remember long ago another starry night like this
1961	1965	In the firelight, Fernando
1966	1970	You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
1970	1974	I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
1974	1979	Were coming from afar
1979	1984	They were closer now, Fernando
1984	1988	Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
1991	1995	I was so afraid, Fernando
1995	2000	We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
2000	2004	And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
2004	2008	- Almost made me cry - ... move it into the pillow.
2008	2010	The pillow forms a perfect sleeping cradle for your head and back.
2011	2013	We all have a different shape to the head and neck.
2013	2015	- By sleeping on a pillow that fits perfectly with your shape... - I'm back.
2015	2019	- you relieve stress on muscles- - You're terrible, Muriel.
2019	2023	Muriel, Daddy's so angry.
2023	2027	He's on his way back from the bank. He'll want to talk to you.
2027	2030	All our money's gone. $12,000.
2030	2034	You didn't do anything bad with those blank cheques I gave you, did you?
2034	2037	- You wouldn't do that to me, would you? - Of course not.
2052	2055	- There was something in the air that night - Did you bring me a present?
2055	2060	The stars were bright, Fernando
2060	2064	They were shining there for you and me
2064	2068	For liberty, Fernando
2068	2072	Though we never thought that we could lose
2072	2076	There's no regret
2076	2079	- If I had to do the same again - Where to, love?
2079	2084	I would, my friend, Fernando
2085	2088	If I had to do the same again
2088	2092	I would, my friend, Fernando
2103	2106	When the coach turns 'round into Stableyard Grove...
2106	2109	we will, for the first time, see a glimpse of the bride...
2109	2112	with her father, the Earl Spencer...
2112	2117	and we'll see that wedding dress which has been kept such a wonderful secret.
2117	2119	There we are.
2120	2122	And what a bride-
2131	2135	Quite a job, getting it. All those yards of silk.
2135	2139	Ah, what a dream she looks. What a dream she looks.
2139	2142	There's a bride any man would be happy to see...
2142	2145	coming down the aisle towards him.
2145	2149	The dress is made of yards of ivory pure silk taffeta.
2150	2153	It has big sleeves with-
2161	2165	- Card number? - Ninety-two. Brice Nobes.
2167	2172	- You take out a lot of videos. - Do I?
2172	2176	You should join our video addicts club. It's for people who take out too many videos.
2176	2179	- Too many? - Well, you know, a lot.
2179	2181	You get a dollar off every new release.
2181	2186	Do you wanna go out with me? You know, on a date.
2189	2191	What?
2192	2194	It's okay. You can say it. I don't mind.
2197	2199	- Videodrama. - It's me.
2199	2201	I still can't find any blokes for us tomorrow night.
2201	2204	Even Tony's busy, and his leg's in a cast.
2204	2207	- I've got one. - You're racing off a customer.
2207	2210	You have got the best job for meeting men.
2214	2216	Turn him around. I can't see his face.
2216	2220	- Can you look at that dry cleaners over there, please? - Sure.
2221	2223	- What do you think? - It's great.
2223	2226	Well, it's a start.
2226	2229	Meet me for lunch. I want to hear every detail.
2232	2234	- You are wicked. - This is my new life.
2234	2237	I'm a new person.
2237	2239	I'm changing my name to Mariel.
2239	2245	- That is your name. - No, Mariel. M-A-R-I-E-L.
2245	2247	- Muriel- - Mariel. - Mariel.
2247	2250	Are you on the run from the law?
2252	2255	I don't care if you are. I'd just like to know.
2255	2260	Well, you know Tim, my ex-fiance?
2262	2264	He was a policeman.
2264	2267	You jilted a cop?
2268	2270	He's after you?
2271	2275	Well, he said if I ever left him, he'd find out who I was living with and shoot them.
2275	2277	Then he'd shoot me, then himself.
2277	2281	Shit. He really loved you, didn't he?
2287	2289	Wow!
2297	2301	- Rhonda's changed my life. - She would.
2305	2308	- Do you- Do you wanna go somewhere else? - What?
2308	2313	- Do you wanna go somewhere else? - Oh, Rhonda wants to stay here.
2314	2316	I'm going. I've got a date.
2319	2322	They're American. Have fun.
2322	2326	Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
2327	2330	Hi, guys! I'm really excited.
2338	2340	Do you wanna dance?
2340	2342	I- I'm a terrible dancer.
2343	2345	I don't care.
2378	2382	Nice flat. Very spacious.
2386	2389	- Cup of tea? - Sure.
2396	2399	Come here. Come here. Here. Right there. Right there.
2405	2409	You've been a bad boy! Yes!
2409	2412	What a guy!
2415	2418	- Bikkies? - What? Sure.
2424	2426	- Jump over the bed! Jump over it! - Wait. Where is the bed?
2427	2429	You get up here. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
2431	2436	- Oh, yes, sir. - Oh, that's rude!
2436	2439	- Ta. - Oh, you wanna go faster.
2439	2441	- Yeah, baby. - Oh, push!
2441	2445	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
2445	2447	Oh, push.
2447	2450	That's right. Faster.
2454	2458	In tonight's news, holiday makers and staff airlifted to safety...
2458	2463	as Cyclone Terry devastates the Hibiscus Island resort.
2463	2466	Buildings and vegetation were flattened in minutes...
2466	2470	by winds of more than 160 kilometres per hour.
2470	2472	- Rhonda and I went to that island. - And the government inquiry...
2473	2475	- Looks like fun. - into corruption continued today...
2475	2478	with president of the Porpoise Spit council, Bill Heslop...
2478	2480	- admitting that he received secret payments... - Tim Tam?
2480	2483	- Maybe after- Later. - from a Japanese land developer.
2483	2486	Councillor Heslop said his judgment had been impaired...
2486	2488	by the shock disappearance of his daughter.
2488	2492	- He made this emotional plea outside the inquiry. - Mariel?
2492	2493	- Muriel? - Mariel.
2494	2495	- Muriel... - What?
2495	2498	if you're watching this, we just want to know you're all right, love.
2498	2502	We don't care about the money. The money doesn't matter.
2502	2505	We just want to know you're all right-
2526	2532	I have to tell you something. I'm a parking inspector.
2534	2536	That's okay.
2578	2581	- What did you do to her? - Nothing.
2581	2583	- Where do you think you're going? Come back. - Ma'am. Hey, lady, are you all right?
2583	2585	- Shit. - On the ground.
2585	2588	- Did he- What did he do to you? - I didn't do anything!
2588	2591	- Just shut up! - What did he do?
2591	2593	- Keep him down there! - What are you doing?
2593	2595	Are you all right? Are you all right?
2595	2598	Get the cops. Call the cops!
2598	2601	- Keep him down! - I didn't do anything!
2603	2607	Mariel. I can't move my legs.
2611	2613	...crept back into his kennel early this morning.
2614	2617	At this stage, no questions are being asked about his mystery escapade.
2626	2631	Well, just keep an eye on him. The doctor will see him. Okay?
2645	2650	- Hello? - It's me. Muriel.
2650	2654	- You're terrible, Muriel. - Why is Dad on TV?
2655	2658	The inquiry. They're saying he takes bribes.
2658	2661	- Does he? - Yeah, but he had to 'cause you stole all our money.
2662	2664	- Was that the telephone ringing? - Dad's moved out.
2664	2668	He says it's all Mum's fault 'cause she gave you the cheques.
2668	2670	He's living in a hotel.
2670	2673	- Who is it? Is it Dad? - Muriel.
2673	2676	Muriel. Oh.
2676	2678	Mum wants to talk to you.
2679	2682	Muriel, are you all right?
2682	2686	We didn't know what had happened to you. We thought you'd become a prostitute or a drug addict.
2686	2688	I'm in Sydney.
2688	2690	Dad's in Sydney for the inquiry.
2691	2693	He'd love to see you. Where are you staying?
2696	2698	He just wants to know you're all right.
2698	2701	- Joan said he's moved out. - No.
2702	2705	Well, w-well, yes, but only for his health.
2707	2710	Dr Farrell says he needs a holiday from us.
2710	2712	I know he blames me for you taking the money...
2712	2715	but I never thought you'd do a thing like that.
2716	2718	Maybe it was a mistake at the bank...
2719	2721	or I wrote the wrong figure on the cheque.
2722	2725	No, I took it.
2729	2730	Yes, maybe you did.
2731	2733	Mum, the federal police are here.
2733	2736	Oh, I have to go. We're being raided again.
2736	2738	- What's your phone number? - Uh, I don't have a phone.
2738	2741	- Well, what's your address? - Look, I'll call you later.
2741	2745	- Well, ring Dad. He's at the Hilton. - Mrs Heslop, we wanna ask you some questions about Bill.
2745	2748	And don't lie to us. We know everything.
2752	2756	This tumour is pressing on the spinal cord...
2757	2760	interrupting the flow of electricity to your legs.
2760	2764	The operation will remove that pressure.
2764	2768	I'd, uh, like to do it soon, in the next 24 hours.
2773	2776	How did I get it?
2776	2780	I mean, it's nothing to do with too much sex, is it?
2780	2784	No, no. Nothing like that.
2784	2788	- We don't know what causes cancer. - Cancer? - Cancer?
2788	2791	You never said anything about cancer.
2791	2795	- That's what the tumour is. It's a can- - I've got cancer!
2795	2798	Oh, God! I'm gonna go bald and have to eat macrobiotic food!
2799	2803	We're not talking about radiotherapy. This is a discreet tumour.
2803	2807	Alone. Isolated. The operation's all we need for the moment.
2807	2812	- For the moment? - There's a minor risk of damage to the spinal cord.
2812	2817	- What does that mean? - It means I'm up shit creek, that's what it means.
2875	2877	Silk chantel.
2879	2882	Imported.
2882	2885	When's your big day?
2885	2889	Your wedding day?
2889	2894	- September. - Spring. Ivory.
2933	2936	- What's your fiance's name? - Bill.
2936	2939	Well, Bill's in for a big surprise.
2939	2942	- Will your mother be coming to see the dress? - No.
2942	2946	No, she can't. She's in hospital.
2946	2949	She's got a tumour in her spine.
2949	2952	She has to have an operation.
2955	2957	We don't usually do this.
2961	2963	But your mother has to see how beautiful you look in that dress.
3007	3010	Doing well. Isn't she doing well, Mariel?
3010	3013	- You're doing really well. - Now this foot forward.
3013	3017	You can do it. Good.
3017	3019	Now the other one.
3021	3023	Good. That's good.
3025	3028	And-
3032	3035	- I have to sit down. - Come on.
3036	3039	- I have to sit down! - All right. I've got you.
3041	3045	Don't panic. Swing around.
3045	3049	That's it. Hand back.
3049	3050	Take a break, honey.
3051	3053	You're doing really well.
3058	3060	How can you stand this?
3061	3064	You push me around in this chair. You cook for me.
3064	3066	You even help me dress. I hate it!
3069	3071	When I lived in Porpoise Spit, I'd just stay in my room for hours...
3071	3074	and listen to ABBA songs.
3074	3078	Sometimes I'd stay in there all day.
3078	3080	But since I've met you and moved to Sydney...
3080	3083	I haven't listened to one ABBA song.
3083	3087	It's because now my life's as good as an ABBA song.
3087	3090	It's as good as "Dancing Queen. "
3091	3093	Come off it.
3098	3100	Promise me something.
3100	3104	- We never go back there. - What do you mean?
3104	3108	I mean, I can't go back and live in Porpoise Spit with Mum.
3108	3112	- Not in a wheelchair, not with her. - You're gonna walk.
3114	3116	Promise we never go back.
3117	3119	I promise.
3122	3125	But you're gonna walk.
3137	3140	I believe there's something out there.
3140	3143	- Yeah. I'm-I'm not a sceptic about it. - I've been cheated by you
3143	3149	- Since I don't know when - Too many people have seen it. There's been too much documentation.
3149	3150	So I made up my mind
3150	3154	- It must come to an end - Taxi for the rehabilitation centre?
3154	3157	- Hang on. I have to get my smokes. - Look at me now - Okay.
3157	3161	Will I ever learn I don't know how
3161	3164	But I suddenly lose control
3164	3168	There's a fire within my soul
3168	3172	Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
3172	3175	One more look and I forget everything
3175	3180	Oh-oh-oh, Mamma mia Here I go again
3180	3184	My, my, how can I resist you
3184	3187	Mamma mia, does it show again
3187	3191	My, my, just how much I've missed you
3191	3194	Yes, I've been broken-hearted
3194	3198	Blue since the day we parted
3198	3201	Why, why did I ever let you go
3201	3205	Mamma Mia, now I really know
3205	3208	My, my, I could never let you go
3215	3219	I've been angry and sad about things that you do
3222	3226	I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
3229	3232	- And when you go When you slam the door - Keep going.
3232	3238	I think you know that you won't be away too long
3238	3242	You know that I'm not that strong
3242	3245	- Just one look and I can hear- - Stop the car!
3249	3251	Beautiful.
3253	3257	I hope the photos help your sister out of that coma.
3257	3261	- Mariel! What are you doing? - No-Nothing.
3262	3264	Why didn't you tell me you were gonna marry Tim?
3264	3268	- Who? - Tim Simms, your fiance- the one who wants to shoot you.
3268	3272	Now, now, now, now just a minute. You can't come in here and threaten brides.
3272	3274	- I don't care how unfortunate you are. - Fuck off.
3275	3278	What is going on, Mariel?
3278	3281	I've seen your wedding album. You've tried on every dress in Sydney.
3281	3284	- That doesn't mean I'm getting married. - What else does it mean?
3284	3287	I wanna get married. I've always wanted to get married.
3287	3291	If I can get married, it means I've changed- I'm a new person.
3291	3295	- How? - Because who would want to marry me?
3297	3301	- Tim Simms. - There is no Tim Simms. I made him up.
3301	3304	In Porpoise Spit, no one would even look at me.
3304	3308	But when I came to Sydney and became Mariel, Brice asked me out.
3308	3310	And that proves I'm already different than I was...
3310	3313	and if someone wants to marry me, I'm not her any more.
3313	3315	- I'm me. - Her?
3315	3317	Muriel! Muriel Heslop!
3318	3320	Stupid, fat and useless! I hate her!
3321	3324	I'm not going back to being her again!
3326	3329	Why can't it be me?
3330	3332	Why can't I be the one?
3341	3344	Have you been in a coma?
3370	3372	Rhonda?
3374	3376	Dad.
3379	3382	If they have a copy of this document, then the option is...
3382	3386	giving you a doctor's certificate saying you are unfit to testify.
3386	3389	Can I have that title deed, Paul? That's the one.
3389	3393	We can only assume that Victor Keinosuke has given them a copy of this deed.
3393	3397	Muriel, why'd you do it to me?
3397	3399	I gave you money. I got you jobs.
3399	3402	I put her through this secretarial course.
3402	3405	$2,000 for two years, it cost me.
3405	3407	Comes out, she can't even type.
3407	3410	I get her into selling cosmetics. We all think she's making a go of it.
3410	3414	Turns out she's robbin' us blind. You're a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!
3415	3418	A- Are you Bill the Battler?
3418	3422	I saw you on TV. Can I please have your autograph?
3422	3424	Me and my dad think that you're not guilty, Bill.
3424	3426	I've changed my name to Mariel.
3426	3429	Good on you, son. You spread it around.
3429	3433	You can't stop progress!
3433	3435	You're comin' back to Porpoise Spit with me.
3435	3438	We'll leave in three weeks, once this inquiry crap's over.
3438	3441	- I can't go back. I'm a new person. - You're a thief.
3441	3445	The only reason I never got the coppers onto you is your mother begged me not to.
3445	3448	I want that money back. I'll get you a job at the Leagues Club.
3448	3449	I'll arrange a bank loan for you.
3450	3452	You're going to make up for what you've done, Muriel.
3455	3460	It's Deidre Chambers. Deidre! Deidre!
3460	3463	Hey, Deidre!
3463	3467	Bill!
3467	3469	What a coincidence! What are you doing in Sydney?
3469	3472	Well, my sister lives in Sydney. I'm down for the long weekend.
3472	3474	- Pull up a chair. - What a coincidence! - My barrister, Graham Newman.
3474	3476	- His two solicitors, and Muriel you know about. - Hello.
3476	3480	It's Mariel!
3481	3486	We should get back, Bill. Victor Keinosuke's testimony starts at 3:00.
3486	3489	That Jap bastard! He's gonna testify that I took bribes from him.
3489	3493	- Commissions. - Commissions. I took commissions.
3493	3497	Cut through all that red tape for him. I deserve some sort of acknowledgement.
3497	3499	They'd never have got to build that resort on Crown Land without me.
3499	3502	- It was the Crown Land that did it. - Total overreaction.
3502	3506	- There were aboriginals living on it. - The federal police raided the house.
3506	3508	Your mother just let them walk in.
3508	3511	She and Perry made statements- told them I had money problems.
3511	3513	- Don't think about it. - Of course I had money problems.
3513	3516	- She stole most of it. - You need your family around you.
3516	3518	If the Feds come near you, don't you say a word.
3518	3522	- Are you and Deidre together? - What?
3525	3527	Have you left Mum for Deidre?
3533	3537	Yes. We're in love.
3542	3544	What about Mum?
3547	3550	What happiness has your father had in his life if he doesn't have me?
3550	3553	- What about Mum? - She'll have you.
3553	3555	You got three weeks.
3576	3580	It's come back- the tumour.
3582	3586	I have to have another operation.
3586	3588	I'm not gonna walk.
3590	3594	But what about your rehabilitation?
3596	3599	They're gonna cut my spinal cord, Mariel.
3602	3604	Mum called.
3604	3609	She wants to take me back to Porpoise Spit.
3609	3612	I told her I was gonna stay here with you.
3646	3650	Head down! Head down! Come on! Come on! Swing it!
3650	3654	Blokes with no legs and no arms cut through the water faster than that!
3654	3657	Look at that! You're going through there like a constipated duck!
3657	3660	Look at 'em flopping around all over the place!
3660	3663	Burchett, what do you think this is, synchronized swimming?
3663	3666	Water aerobics for geriatrics? You're supposed to be a sprinter!
3666	3668	Go! Go! Go! Go!
3671	3673	Mariel?
3674	3677	Ken Blundell. How are ya?
3678	3680	Van Arkle!
3684	3688	I think we found you a girl.
3699	3702	David Van Arkle, Mariel Heslop.
3711	3715	Mariel, you've probably seen the news about the civil war in South Africa.
3715	3719	Well, just as the South Africans seem to be doing the right thing by the blacks...
3719	3723	the police open fire on a black soccer club, and that is bad news for David.
3724	3728	- Are you black? - What?
3731	3733	I don't know why I said that.
3733	3736	Well, well, it is funny, in a way.
3736	3739	But let's be honest. The South Africans were never much chop in the pool anyway.
3740	3742	David here is a bit of a freak, really.
3742	3744	And I think that he is gonna get the gold medal...
3744	3749	for the 1,500 metres in the next Olympic Games.
3749	3752	Mariel, how did you feel when Kieren Perkins...
3752	3754	took gold for Australia at Barcelona?
3756	3760	- Who? - Kieren Perkins.
3760	3763	- He's an Australian champion. - Now, David's family...
3763	3766	are willing to do anything to see him fulfil his potential as a champion...
3767	3769	even if it means swimming for another country.
3769	3773	And they're willing to pay $10,000...
3773	3777	to the girl that'll help Dave out.
3777	3781	Are you from Sydney originally?
3781	3784	What? No, Porpoise Spit.
3784	3786	A- And why did you leave there?
3787	3792	Well, because of all the mental things that happened to me.
3792	3796	I got shallow, and my physical being could have been improved...
3796	3799	and as well as my mentality.
3799	3801	- What about the black-haired one? - No, she was Turkish.
3801	3803	She's only been in the country five minutes.
3803	3806	Now, whoever marries David will have to...
3806	3808	tell the immigration authorities that they're in love with him.
3808	3810	Now there'll be media attention...
3811	3813	so they'll have to live with David in his flat...
3813	3816	for at least four months after the marriage.
3816	3819	I've worked out all the details of the romance...
3819	3821	which you and David will have to stick to.
3822	3824	But the most important thing is to convince people...
3824	3826	that you two are really in love.
3827	3828	- What about the blonde? - You didn't like her.
3828	3832	- I'm not so sure now. - Now, I think Mariel might be...
3832	3835	just what we're looking for.
3835	3839	Well, it's up to you now, love. Would you find it difficult to lie?
3840	3843	I could try.
3843	3845	Well, don't rush your decision...
3845	3848	but if you could let us know by tomorrow morning.
3918	3922	You can dance, you can jive
3922	3926	Having the time of your life
3926	3931	Ooh, see that girl Watch that scene
3931	3935	Diggin' the dancing queen
3969	3972	I know you couldn't have got up onto the altar, but at least she could have asked you to be bridesmaid.
3972	3975	- She did. - Why didn't you say yes?
3976	3977	You could have been on television.
3978	3980	I don't want to sit up here, Mum.
3980	3984	- I wanna sit in the corner. - No one'll see you over there.
3986	3989	Well, if this is your attitude, I don't know why you bothered coming.
3996	3999	At least you won't be in anyone's way.
4013	4015	Rhonda?
4017	4019	Is that you?
4022	4025	- You're the bridesmaids? - Isn't it fantastic?
4025	4028	- We always knew MarieI'd come good. - She's in all the papers.
4029	4032	- What happened to you? - I had cancer.
4032	4037	It's all right. They cut it out. I won't walk again though.
4039	4044	- You were so full of life. - I'm not dead, Cheryl.
4045	4049	Come on. We better get ready. Mariel's coming.
4049	4052	You must be so happy for her.
4055	4057	God, she has cancer!
4057	4060	I'm divorcing Chook.
4060	4063	I suppose I have you to thank for that.
4063	4066	I hope I can do the same for you one day.
4089	4092	You told me it would be a quick civil ceremony.
4092	4094	Ah, it's good she wanted a church wedding. It's romantic.
4095	4097	It looks like you mean it.
4098	4101	All the guests are on her side. I should have hired you some friends.
4102	4103	The charges don't surprise me.
4104	4105	The bastards have been out to get me from the beginnin'.
4106	4107	I just wanted you to know-
4114	4116	Mariel, are you marrying David for money?
4116	4119	Is this a marriage of convenience, Mariel?
4119	4121	Mariel, how long have you and David-
4121	4124	Your Mum's arriving in Sydney by bus because I can't afford a plane ticket.
4124	4126	- You see what you've done to me? - Where is she now?
4126	4128	I don't know. Trying to get a taxi, I suppose.
4140	4143	Mariel.
4143	4145	You're beautiful.
4188	4191	Love me or leave me
4191	4196	Make your choice, but believe me
4196	4199	I love you
4199	4203	I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
4206	4209	I can't conceal it
4209	4213	Don't you see Can't you feel it
4213	4216	Don't you too
4216	4220	I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
4222	4226	Oh, I've been dreaming
4226	4232	Through my lonely past
4232	4235	Now I just made it
4235	4239	I've found you at last
4239	4243	So come on now Let's try it
4243	4247	I love you, you can't deny it
4248	4249	- 'Cause it's true - Oh, God.
4250	4255	- Don't panic. Think of the games. - I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
4257	4259	She's all yours, mate.
4267	4272	Father, when You created mankind, You willed that man and wife should be one.
4272	4275	- Join David and Muriel- - Mariel.
4275	4278	Mariel in the loving union of marriage...
4278	4281	so that they may be living witness to Your divine love in the world.
4283	4285	David, do you take Mariel to be your wife?
4285	4288	Do you promise to be true to her in good times and in bad...
4288	4292	in sickness and in health- to love and honour her all the days of your life?
4301	4304	Uh, yeah. Okay. All right. Why not? I do.
4304	4306	Mariel, do you take David to be your husband?
4306	4309	Do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad...
4309	4312	in sickness and in health- to love and honour him all the days of your life?
4312	4315	I do.
4315	4318	You have declared your consent before the Church.
4318	4322	May the Lord strengthen that consent and fill you with His blessings.
4322	4327	What God has joined, men must not divide.
4342	4348	Mariel, take this ring as a sign of my, uh-
4349	4354	- Love and fidelity. - Love and fidelity.
4354	4358	- In the name of the Father- - In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
4358	4362	David, I take this ring as a sign of your love and fidelity...
4362	4366	in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
4366	4369	I now pronounce you man and wife.
4371	4373	Congratulations.
4376	4379	You may kiss your bride.
4411	4413	Congratulations! Oh, David!
4422	4424	Good on you.
4424	4427	- Mr Heslop. - It's Bill.
4427	4429	Mrs Heslop.
4437	4440	- Thanks. - Mariel, congratulations.
4440	4446	- Thank you. - You look lovely. Have every success.
4446	4448	Well done, love.
4449	4451	Good on you.
4469	4471	- How do you feel? - He's fighting fit.
4471	4474	The next gold you'll see on this hand will be the gold medal for the 1,500 metres!
4474	4476	- You reckon? - Oh, yes.
4476	4479	Mariel and us have been friends for years. We went to Hibiscus Island together.
4479	4480	- We're like sisters. - She's my best friend.
4481	4485	- I-I tell her everything. - Mariel! Oh, you look beautiful!
4486	4488	Oh, isn't she beautiful?
4489	4490	She is wearing the make-up, isn't she?
4495	4497	Smile.
4506	4511	- I was tryin' to hide from you. - I saw your wheels.
4513	4517	- I didn't think you'd come. - I had to see it for myself.
4517	4520	Just the bridesmaids were worth it.
4521	4525	I didn't call them. They came crawling back to me.
4525	4527	The way they picked on me in Porpoise Spit...
4528	4529	saying I wouldn't amount to anything-
4530	4534	And here I am, famous, and they're at my wedding.
4534	4537	- I showed them. - Showed them what?
4537	4539	I'm as good as they are.
4542	4545	I have to go. Good luck with what's his name.
4545	4547	Where are you going?
4548	4551	Where do you think? Back to Porpoise Spit with Mum.
4551	4556	- We're catching the bus out tonight. - I don't want you to.
4556	4559	Well, you should have thought of that before you gave up on me.
4560	4562	I couldn't pay all the rent without you. I couldn't even do the shopping.
4565	4567	I needed help. I needed a friend.
4567	4570	I mean, I don't want you to go back by bus.
4570	4573	I bought you two plane tickets.
4574	4577	Go to hell.
4577	4580	I already gave 'em to your mum.
4580	4583	You're right. You are a new person, and you stink.
4584	4586	Mariel Van Arkle stinks!
4586	4589	And she's not half the person Muriel Heslop was.
4589	4593	Rhonda, your mum just told us you're moving back to Porpoise Spit.
4593	4596	- It'll be just like old times. - Don't worry about Rhonda, Mrs E.
4596	4599	We'll push her around.
4627	4630	- Are you rich? - My parents own it.
4632	4635	- They didn't come to the wedding. - No.
4636	4639	They paid for it.
4639	4644	They're in Johannesburg. Kitchen, lounge room, gym.
4644	4647	You can use everything but the weights.
4647	4650	Bathroom, my room.
4658	4661	Your room.
4661	4664	I'm going downstairs for a swim.
4672	4675	It wasn't just the money, was it?
4678	4682	What kind of person marries someone they don't know?
4683	4686	You did.
4686	4691	I want to win. All my life I've wanted to win.
4692	4694	Me too.
4797	4802	$84.20. $84.20.
4805	4807	Ninety-nine cents.
4808	4810	Ninety, one hundred.
4810	4814	Thanks, Mrs Heslop. Have a nice day.
4816	4819	You can see she's not right in the head.
4819	4823	- Look, I'll see what I can do, Bill. - You're a mate. I won't forget it.
4823	4826	I'll be in touch.
4831	4833	I meant to pay.
4839	4844	I need help- around the house, and-
4846	4848	3:00 news update.
4862	4865	Not comin' back. I want a divorce.
4865	4867	I'm marrying Deidre.
4871	4873	You know what they say?
4873	4875	They say that I wasn't elected to the state government that time...
4875	4877	because my family wasn't up to scratch.
4877	4881	That's what they say. Look at this place!
4881	4883	I never had a bloody chance!
4927	4931	Get out! Get out and find yourself a job!
4931	4935	Get out, you layabout, and stop embarrassing your father!
4935	4938	- You're an embarrassment! - You're the embarrassment!
4938	4941	You mad bitch!
5007	5009	Oh, no.
5017	5020	Mariel Van Arkle speaking.
5023	5026	- Hello? - Muriel?
5026	5029	- Mariel. - Mum's died.
5029	5032	- What? - We're all at the hospital.
5032	5036	Dad says you have to come home.
5063	5066	Yeah.
5066	5069	The funeral's tomorrow. Are you coming?
5069	5072	Russell's gonna be there.
5072	5077	Yeah. I invited him. He says he's gonna bring Alan.
5077	5079	Hi.
5084	5087	- Hi. - Mariel?
5087	5089	Is that you?
5090	5092	Not sure.
5101	5104	It was a heart attack.
5104	5106	Joanie found her.
5106	5110	She was lying on the bed, looking peaceful.
5110	5112	She didn't suffer.
5112	5116	She made the ultimate sacrifice for your father.
5116	5122	Judge will be lenient on him now. He's got kids to support.
5122	5126	She'd be glad, in the end, her life amounted to something.
5128	5130	Deidre, I finished up in the bathroom.
5130	5134	You were right about those cupboards.
5135	5137	Let's start on the laundry then.
5137	5139	It's a big job.
5170	5173	- What happened? - Mum burnt it.
5177	5179	Why?
5179	5183	Because she got sick and tired of waiting for Perry to mow it.
5190	5192	Hi.
5203	5205	What am I gonna do without her?
5217	5219	Her photo album.
5250	5256	She took pills- sleeping pills.
5256	5259	They were next to her when I found her.
5260	5264	And when Dr Farrell come, they were gone.
5264	5267	And when I asked what happened to 'em...
5267	5269	Dad said he didn't want anyone to know.
5269	5273	Dr Farrell said Dad had been through enough.
5276	5280	I don't know. Maybe he has.
5286	5291	The Lord is good to me
5291	5295	His word my hope
5296	5300	Secures
5300	5304	He will my shield
5304	5308	And portion be
5308	5313	As long as life
5313	5317	Endures
5325	5328	I have a telefax to read.
5328	5331	Keep your eye on them journalist bastards.
5334	5337	"To Bill Heslop and Family...
5337	5343	Hazel and I were sorry to hear of the passing of Betty.
5343	5347	We are thinking of you in your time of sorrow. "
5347	5351	Signed, the honourable Bob Hawke...
5351	5355	former prime minister of Australia.
5355	5358	- What are they doin'? - They're, they're writin' it down.
5358	5362	I'll bet they are. Put that in your papers, you mongrel bastards.
5362	5366	I've still got friends.
5366	5368	How many families get telegrams from former prime ministers...
5368	5371	when somebody dies?
5371	5374	I'm not forgotten.
5374	5379	Betty Heslop lived for her family.
5379	5383	She was very happy about her daughter Mariel's marriage...
5383	5386	and attending the wedding in Sydney...
5386	5391	was one of the highlights of her life.
5391	5395	Her life, during her last days on earth...
5395	5397	made me think of-
5402	5405	Mariel.
5414	5416	I'm sorry.
5436	5439	I thought I was so different-
5440	5443	a new person.
5443	5446	But I'm not.
5446	5449	I'm just the same as him.
5549	5551	Heslop.
5551	5554	On The Beach Motel.
5554	5557	One.
5574	5576	I can't stay married to you, David.
5579	5582	I've got to stop lying now.
5583	5585	I tell so many lies.
5585	5588	One day I won't know I'm doing it.
5593	5595	I don't love you.
5600	5603	I- I don't love you either, but, uh-
5605	5609	I don't know. I-I think I could like having you around.
5613	5616	I'll give you the money back.
5616	5618	It's yours.
5660	5661	Good luck in the games.
5664	5666	You too.
5682	5685	I don't understand it.
5688	5691	Why'd she burn the back yard?
5694	5695	We've got to stick together.
5696	5698	You've got to help me with the kids.
5699	5701	What about Deidre?
5701	5704	She'll lend a hand. I don't think she's keen to marry me...
5705	5707	now that livin' with the kids has come into it.
5708	5712	Someone's got to look after them.
5712	5716	And it has to be you, Dad.
5716	5719	You owe me, Muriel.
5719	5722	Now, this isn't all of it...
5722	5725	but I'll pay the rest off when I get back to Sydney and get a job.
5734	5736	So you're not gonna help me out. Is that it?
5736	5740	You owe us, Dad. We're not useless.
5740	5744	We never were. Now you're looking after the kids...
5744	5747	and you're gonna tell them they're not useless.
5753	5756	How about that telegram from Bob Hawke?
5758	5760	How'd you get that?
5760	5763	I phoned his office.
5763	5765	I was nearly in the state government.
5765	5768	Fourteen votes I needed.
5768	5772	Nobody knew who'd won for three days till the postal vote came in.
5772	5775	For three days, I was almost there.
5778	5781	Couldn't win a chook raffle now.
5782	5785	Resigned from the council.
5786	5791	I'm unemployed. Got to go on the dole.
5792	5795	Imagine the faces when I walk into that dole office.
5796	5799	You reap what you sow.
5799	5802	You'd think I'd have learned that growin' up on a farm.
5805	5807	You reap what you sow.
5812	5816	Dad, the cricket's started.
5818	5820	Hi, Joan.
5820	5824	- Muriel's goin' back to Sydney. - Are ya?
5824	5827	I thought you were stayin' here with us.
5835	5838	Keep in touch.
5838	5841	Bye, Dad.
5847	5850	Do you want me to open you a can of beer?
5852	5856	That would be lovely, Joanie. With you in a sec.
5858	5861	I'm giving it another chance with Chook-
5861	5863	as soon as he gets out of the correction centre.
5863	5867	They've accused him of raping a Japanese tourist, which is ridiculous!
5867	5870	Chook hates the Japanese.
5870	5874	We better fly. We're meeting Rose Biggs for lunch.
5874	5877	Rose Biggs? Are you friends with her?
5877	5880	Once we got to know her, we found out she was just like us.
5880	5882	But Rose Biggs sucked your husband's cock.
5882	5884	- Rhonda! - Oh, she did. - I know.
5885	5887	But w-
5887	5890	I sucked her husband's cock, and it made me realize...
5890	5892	we all make mistakes.
5893	5895	Hi.
5895	5898	- Mariel. - Muriel.
5899	5901	What a surprise!
5902	5906	Rhonda, Mariel- Muriel's come to visit you.
5907	5912	Actually, I've come to ask Rhonda if she wants to come back to Sydney.
5912	5917	I've got a taxi outside and two plane tickets, if you want to.
5917	5922	- What about your husband? - We broke up.
5922	5925	I knew it wouldn't last.
5925	5928	What makes you think I'd go anywhere with you?
5929	5931	Because I'm your friend.
5933	5936	Muriel, you can't come bargin' in here without warning...
5936	5939	trying to turn Rhonda against the people who love her-
5940	5944	against the people who were there for her when she needed them.
5947	5950	Yes, she can.
5950	5953	Sorry, Mum. You know I love you, but you drive me crazy.
5953	5956	And you three- what a bunch of cocksuckers.
5972	5975	Who do you think you are to call me that?

6211	6214	Can you hear the drums, Fernando
6216	6220	I remember long ago another starry night like this
6223	6227	In the firelight, Fernando
6228	6232	You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
6232	6236	I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
6236	6241	Were coming from afar
6241	6245	They were closer now, Fernando
6246	6251	Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
6253	6257	I was so afraid, Fernando
6257	6262	We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
6262	6266	And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
6266	6270	Almost made me cry
6270	6273	There was something in the air that night
6273	6279	The stars were bright, Fernando
6279	6282	They were shining there for you and me
6282	6286	For liberty, Fernando
6286	6290	Though we never thought that we could lose
6290	6294	There's no regret
6294	6297	If I had to do the same again
6297	6302	I would, my friend, Fernando
6303	6306	If I had to do the same again
6306	6310	I would, my friend, Fernando
