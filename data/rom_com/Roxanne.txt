101	105	I am walking, yes indeed, and I am talking about you and me -
105	109	- and I am hoping you bop-be-da-deh.
110	115	I am forming words with my tongue I am stumbling, but I am okay now.
117	122	Now, I am walking down the steps, it is easier than walking up the steps.
123	128	Did not slide. That is a tough break for me.
129	134	Now, I am having a small heart attack, but I am recovering.
134	138	Now I am seeing two coked-out hopheads coming at me -
138	140	- could be trouble.
141	145	- Get off the sidewalk! - Other side of the street, scum.
145	148	It is a cop!
148	151	If he is a cop, where is his gun?
153	155	He is a fireman.
159	161	Cut a wide swath, pussy.
162	165	- All right. - Thank you, arse-wipe.
165	167	Christ, that is the biggest nose...
167	170	Do not say it...
173	176	Quite a hood ornament you have there.
177	181	Here it comes... Three-D coming at you!
183	187	- I really admire your shoes. - What?
187	191	- I love your shoes. - What?
191	192	I was just thinking -
192	198	- as much as I admire them and would love to have a pair just like them -
198	203	- I would not want to be in your shoes right now.
213	217	- I do not really know karate. - I did not think so.
227	230	- Get pissed, Rich. - I am pissed.
235	237	Fifteen - Love.
245	247	You want trouble? You will get it.
252	254	Oh, fault.
256	258	If that is how you want to play...
258	260	You broke my nose!
267	271	- Had enough yet? - Thirty - Love.
272	274	Surprise! ...Forty - Love.
276	278	Are we having fun yet?
286	288	Service.
290	291	Game.
293	295	Let us play again sometime.
305	307	Grover?
317	319	Dixie?
329	332	Where the hell is she? Here is your racket.
332	335	Thank you. What is this stuff on it?
336	339	Blood. Where is my tea?
339	343	- Will you tell me about it? - You are too young.
343	346	Come here, Grover.
355	357	Damn it.
357	361	There had better be a window open, Grover.
361	363	I will have you neutered.
364	368	Do not go anywhere. I will go to the front.
385	387	Oh, no!
392	395	I cannot believe it.
409	413	Goddamn it, we are supposed to put them out!
413	416	- Guys, guys! - What now?
420	423	I have a dream, just a little dream.
423	427	My dream, I hope you do not find it crazy -
427	431	- is that I would like the people here to feel -
431	437	- that if there were a fire, calling the fire department would be a wise idea.
437	441	You cannot have people with burning houses saying:
441	444	"Whatever you do, do not call the fire department."
444	446	That would be bad.
449	453	Please, get it cleaned up. Do not make me have to explain it.
459	461	Hello...
461	464	Hello?
464	467	I am locked out of my house.
467	470	I can get you in. I will get my tools.
470	473	I do not have any clothes on.
475	477	Do you want a coat or something?
477	482	No, I would like to stand naked in this bush in the freezing cold.
482	486	- I will get the tools. - Thank you.
489	491	- What is it? - Somebody locked out of their house.
491	496	- Do you need any help? - No, it looks boring. I will go.
497	501	- Nobody had a coat? - You said you did not want one.
501	504	- Why would I not want a coat? - You said so!
504	509	- I was being ironic. - Oh, irony. We do not get that here.
509	514	People ski topless here while smoking dope, so irony is not a high priority.
514	518	We have not had irony here since '83, when I was the only practitioner of it, -
519	522	- and I stopped as I was tired of being stared at.
522	525	You should turn off the lights when you are locked out -
525	527	- you waste electricity.
527	530	You can hide your nakedness in that bush.
531	534	I notice you do not have any tattoos. Wise choice.
535	539	Jackie Onassis would not have gone so far with an anchor on her arm.
539	542	Every job has a perfect tool.
546	550	This lock does not accept Master Charge. We will try the old reliable.
550	552	And when I say -
552	557	- "old reliable", I am lying, because I never tried this before.
557	560	You may not want to watch this.
569	572	Be careful.
576	578	God, I hate heights.
583	588	- What are you doing? I am freezing! - For God's sake, put something on!
589	591	Thank you.
600	604	Here you go. I am averting my eyes, finally.
610	614	Look what you got me into, Grover.
616	621	- Do you want to come in? - I... sort of already did.
621	626	You must be starving, so I made us some cheese and vegetables -
626	628	- au naturel.
629	633	Would you like some wine with your nose... cheese?
633	636	Wine would be fine.
642	645	- Do you have a straw? - No, I do not. Why?
645	648	No particular reason.
665	667	Cheers.
678	682	Party trick... Well, a nose by any other name.
682	685	"Would smell as sweet."
688	692	My name is C.D. Bales. I am the fire chief. Call me Charlie.
692	695	I am Roxanne. Thank you for your help.
695	698	I know the lady who owns this house.
698	701	Dixie? She gave me a good deal for the summer.
701	705	- Nice and cheap, I bet. - Well, it is worth it.
705	707	This house has a great spot for that.
707	710	- I thought you would never ask. - I did not.
710	712	What is it, the mummy?
713	715	It is a telescope, it is beautiful.
716	718	- You must know about M31. - Yes.
718	721	I like it when they give astronomical objects names.
721	726	Like Andromeda, Saturn and... Sea of Tranquility.
727	730	This numbering thing is too boring for us civilians.
732	736	Do you know how many objects are up there?
736	738	I know it is over fifty.
739	742	I think they do well. They have many things to name.
743	747	How about Moo-on, Gluon, Quark?
747	749	Do you know what a quark is?
750	753	I used to, I just forgot right now.
753	756	We do not know everything, do we?
756	759	Sit down and I will show you.
763	767	No one has ever seen a quark, but we know they exist.
767	769	There are at least six different types:
769	775	Up, Down, Strange, Charmed, Bottom and Top.
775	777	That is their flavour.
777	780	Top and Bottom Quarks are most common.
780	785	Only an unusually exotic collision can produce the Strange and the Charmed.
786	787	It is beautiful, is it not?
788	791	Yes. These are... astronomical objects, then?
791	794	No, sub-nuclear particles.
794	797	I thought so.
798	802	- So, what are you looking for? - I cannot tell you.
802	805	- Why is that? - I cannot, it is a secret.
805	809	I have a few secrets, some important ones, too.
809	814	Actually, I have one pretty impor... I have one lousy one.
814	817	Actually, I do not have any secrets at all.
817	819	It is just so depressing.
824	828	- Did you say your name was Roxanne? - Yes.
828	831	It is unusual; it is pretty.
834	836	There is a name for a galaxy.
838	841	Sorry, I did not mean to wax rhapsodic.
841	844	I should go, it is late and I have work to do.
844	847	Okay, but wish me luck.
847	850	- On what? - Just wish me luck.
850	856	No, I do not believe in luck. Wish for something to happen.
857	861	- I know what you mean. Goodbye. - Goodbye.
863	865	I am fine.
881	884	Roxanne.
886	890	It is a party town, maestro. You will love it.
898	901	- Gafornasemano. - What?
902	905	Were you playmate of the month, June '85?
905	906	No.
907	911	That is funny, I thought I recognised your inner diameter slope.
911	913	What is that?
913	917	The part of your leg that curves into your inner thigh.
919	921	Works every time, maestro.
921	924	I call you maestro because you are great with the chicks, right?
925	927	All right, men, let us go.
929	931	All right, are you ready?
935	937	What?
939	941	What is going on here?
942	945	Training.
946	951	I want it to say action with style. Like a GQ fire fighter.
951	956	This is Chris, our new pro. A real fire fighter.
956	960	Welcome, I am Mayor Deebs. We did not expect you until Monday.
960	964	- I came early to get a good start. - He is a maniac with the chicks, too.
964	968	This is Dean, Trent, and my personal tailor, Sam.
968	970	I will show you your room.
970	974	- Cuffs or no cuffs? - You better get off that hose.
979	983	Do you think I can get the telescope up the stairs?
983	986	I will ask C.D. to leave his encyclopedias.
986	990	- He reads encyclopedias? - He is an encyclopedia.
990	993	- He is funny. - Yes, he is great.
993	994	He is my god-brother.
995	997	These uniforms really work...
998	999	I can tell.
999	1002	- What about your boyfriend? - Richard.
1003	1007	- When is he coming? - He is not coming.
1007	1009	What happened?
1009	1014	We just ran out of gas... I guess I mistook sex for love.
1014	1017	I did that once, it was great.
1019	1022	Sandy is a very deep person.
1024	1026	Oh my God, who is that?
1028	1030	She can certainly make my night.
1030	1032	Who is she?
1033	1035	Sandy...
1035	1037	Who is that?
1037	1041	That is Roxanne. She studies astronomy or astrology...
1041	1043	Is there a difference?
1044	1046	Look, someone is checking you out.
1047	1050	Now, he could cheer you up.
1050	1053	If I was you, I would do something about that.
1053	1057	Maybe... Maybe later, maybe not.
1058	1061	You are playing it beautifully.
1062	1065	- Do you mind if I give it a shot? - Go right ahead.
1065	1067	Thank you, maestro.
1074	1080	I would like to invite you to a Nelson tradition of hot-tubbing.
1080	1081	Pardon me?
1081	1084	It is a tradition. We consume mulled wine -
1085	1088	- and enjoy some outdoor hot-tubbing.
1088	1093	When the settlers came here 100 years ago, they started hot-tubbing?
1093	1097	What? ...Oh, yeah. You are feisty, I like that.
1097	1099	His ego is the size of Brazil.
1099	1103	- I have to stop talking to you. - Okay, no problem.
1103	1110	I will be over there. Think about it and if you change your mind, come on over.
1110	1112	And I think you might.
1112	1114	If I do change my mind, you will know -
1115	1119	- because my breasts will be heaving and moist with perspiration.
1121	1123	- So long, foxy. - So long.
1125	1130	- Look! Only enough for one drink. - This is what it is like being single.
1130	1133	- He has a great arse. - Too bad it is on his shoulders.
1133	1135	He is cute.
1135	1140	I like cute, I just want to meet someone with half a brain.
1140	1141	Good luck.
1170	1174	He went up there before school and will not come down.
1174	1177	All right... I will see what I can do.
1179	1181	The name is Bales. B-a-l-e-s.
1188	1191	He did it before, but never stayed this long.
1191	1194	It is going to be all right, honey.
1201	1206	What is the trouble, Peter? Come on, what is the matter?
1207	1211	They call me "Porky" at school.
1213	1216	Why do they have to do that? Goddamn it...
1218	1221	I should not say that in front of you.
1222	1224	Did you talk to your mother about it?
1224	1229	Once I tried. She said I should clean up my plate first.
1230	1235	See, that is good. You are way better than these guys who make fun of you.
1235	1238	You are smart and you are funny.
1238	1243	- You can make things up. - I did not make it up. It is true.
1244	1249	Bastards! I should not say that in front of you.
1251	1255	- Do I have to get down now? - No.
1257	1261	Let us just stay up here for a while.
1265	1271	That is our new computer. We can pinpoint any fire in town with that.
1271	1272	Yes, I can see that.
1273	1276	It is perfect for us... we are the fire department.
1276	1278	That is perfect.
1278	1281	- Hi, I am Andy. - Good to meet you.
1281	1284	I just wanted to welcome you.
1287	1291	There is one thing... Have you met the chief?
1291	1293	No.
1293	1296	He is funny looking. I would not mention it.
1296	1298	Of course not.
1298	1302	I figured you would not. But sometimes, you know -
1302	1306	- things accidentally slip out and then, you know...
1311	1313	Watch it on that stair.
1313	1316	Who designed these steps? The Marquis de Sade?
1316	1318	Why is it so heavy? It is mostly air.
1318	1320	And glass, so be careful.
1320	1324	My aunt knitted one of these. It was much lighter than this.
1325	1330	- This secret of yours relates to this? - Sort of, yes.
1330	1335	What are you doing, Charlie? I cannot hold this by myself!
1336	1339	You do not have to tell me.
1339	1341	Okay, I will tell you.
1341	1345	All right, start talking. Here we go.
1347	1350	I think I have discovered a comet.
1353	1357	It is no big deal, there are a lot of comets.
1357	1359	I was working on this paper -
1359	1366	- on the ork cloud, and I discovered a mathematical irregularity.
1366	1370	I have not climbed so many steps since I went to the Maharishi.
1372	1377	I think it is a series of ten comets... Watch it around this corner.
1378	1382	Or the forerunner of a big comet which is due back this summer.
1382	1384	Will you find it with this?
1385	1388	No, my uncle is looking for it in a big scope in Arizona.
1388	1390	I carried it up here for nothing?
1390	1395	Not really. Put that counter balance on that arm with the key.
1395	1399	- So, what do you get if you are right? - Nothing.
1399	1403	Well, I graduate, that is for sure... And I get to name it.
1403	1407	That is pretty good. Sort of historical.
1408	1409	Comet Kowalski.
1410	1413	Why? You could give it a beautiful name.
1413	1417	- That is my name. - It is? Roxanne Kowalski?
1417	1419	Oh, sorry.
1419	1421	So, when did you find out about this?
1421	1427	July 1 4, 22:08:31... Give or take ten days.
1428	1433	- That would really be something. - Yes.
1440	1443	Do not look now, but the Viking just came in.
1445	1449	Come in, shake hands with the mayor. You will look important.
1450	1451	He should be bronzed.
1451	1454	I am told you are fast, efficient and brilliant -
1455	1457	- with the ladies.
1458	1462	If anything happens to you, C.D. will be all over my Kazistkey...
1482	1487	- Get a hold of yourself. - It is now or never.
1488	1492	- Do it, Roxanne. - There is only one way to tell.
1493	1496	Okay, when he comes out -
1496	1500	- I will invite him to a Nelson tradition of hot-tubbing, -
1500	1505	- and I will set him up with some mulled wine, and I will bathe him a lot.
1505	1509	- I am shocked. - I am not shocked.
1509	1514	Confidence, confidence... A little water and I am ready to talk to her.
1515	1518	Oh, no!
1550	1554	- Do you remember me? - I am trying to put it behind me.
1554	1560	- Is this your shop? - Yes, all mine.
1560	1564	- It is perfect. - Thank you very much.
1564	1568	- It is really you. - I appreciate that.
1568	1573	Come in and check out the freeze-dried animals, they are incredibly lifelike.
1574	1576	Maybe next time.
1591	1595	C.D., it came to me last night in a flash.
1595	1596	What is that?
1597	1601	The thing, the gimmick: The Nelson promotional cow!
1603	1606	You give her a name: Suzy, Bossy...
1606	1611	You put her picture in our posters, teaching her to drink a beer.
1611	1615	- These things work. - I think it is a fantastic idea.
1615	1619	- You like it? - I love it, I think it is great!
1619	1625	I think it is brilliant, what an idea! And I was there, I saw it happen:
1625	1630	He took the idea, ripe on the tree. He plucked it and he put it in his pocket.
1630	1633	It is, dare I say, genius?
1633	1640	No, no... but maybe it is. Maybe I am in the presence of greatness...
1642	1645	- Have you met C.D. yet? - No, not yet.
1645	1649	- There is something you should know. - He has a big nose, right?
1650	1655	- Whatever you do, do not stare. - Come on, I will not stare.
1655	1661	None of us would, but you get there and you feel yourself not staring.
1661	1665	Then it seems obvious you are not staring, so you will look -
1665	1668	- and you will think, "I am staring."
1668	1674	You think, "this is ridiculous", so you take a good look, and you think:
1674	1680	"I am looking at a man who, when he washes his face, loses the bar of soap."
1681	1685	- Thank you, guys. - Do not say we did not warn you.
1693	1697	You think people go to Sun Valley to see their fire department?
1697	1700	No, work with me. You have to use promotion.
1700	1704	That way the town grows and the fire department grows.
1704	1708	You cannot run a fire department with the 7 banana brothers -
1708	1709	- you need professionals.
1710	1713	This town could be another Aspen. They make tons of money.
1713	1718	As soon as this Oktoberfest is over, you will get your funds back.
1723	1728	I have a drink, then I start to relax and then I start to have fun.
1728	1732	It is not something I want to start at this point in my life.
1733	1735	I heard you were tough.
1735	1737	I am...
1738	1742	But if you use a little tenderizer, I might cook up pretty good.
1742	1744	Arsehole.
1744	1746	Where are you going, big nose?
1751	1753	Pardon me?
1754	1757	You heard me, big nose.
1758	1761	- Is that it? - Yes.
1761	1765	You really got me on that one, did you not?
1767	1769	Wait a second...
1770	1773	What a waste of an opportunity.
1773	1776	Someone is standing in front of you with this -
1777	1779	- and all you can think up is "big nose"?
1779	1782	Can you think up something better?
1782	1786	Yes, I think I can think up something better. Come here.
1787	1792	With this dart... I will think up whatever number you hit.
1794	1796	Twenty!
1797	1799	Two out of three.
1803	1808	- Twenty. - Darts Champion, Denver, 1 987.
1808	1811	Come on, Charlie, you can do it.
1812	1815	All right, twenty something betters.
1815	1818	I start with the obvious:
1818	1822	Excuse me, is that your nose or did a bus park on your face?
1822	1827	Meterological: Everybody take cover, she will blow!
1827	1832	Fashionable: You could de-emphasise your nose if you wore something larger -
1832	1834	- like Wyoming.
1835	1840	Personal: Well, here we are... Just the three of us.
1840	1845	Punctual: Okay, your nose was on time, but you were 15 minutes late.
1845	1849	Envious: Oh, I wish I were you -
1849	1853	- to be able to smell your own ear!
1855	1860	Naughty: Some of the ladies have asked if you would put that thing away.
1861	1864	Philosophical: It is not the size of a nose that is important -
1865	1868	- it is what is in it that matters.
1868	1871	Humorous: Laugh and the world laughs with you -
1871	1874	- sneeze and it is goodbye, Seattle.
1875	1881	Commercial: Hi, I am Earl Scheib and I can paint that nose for $39.95!
1881	1883	Polite: Would you mind not bobbing your head?
1883	1886	The orchestra keeps changing the tempo.
1887	1888	Melodic: Everybody.
1888	1893	He has got the whole world in his nose.
1895	1900	Sympathetic: What happened? Did your parents lose a bet with God?
1901	1904	Complimentary: You must love the birdies -
1904	1907	- to give them this to perch on.
1907	1913	Scientific: Say, does that thing there influence the tides?
1913	1917	Obscure: Whoa, I would hate to see the grindstone.
1918	1921	Well, think about it.
1921	1924	Inquiry: When you stop and smell the flowers -
1924	1926	- are they afraid?
1928	1933	French: The pigs have refused to find any more truffles -
1933	1936	- until you leave.
1936	1942	Pornographic: Finally a man who can satisfy two women at once.
1944	1948	- How many is that? - Fourteen, Chief.
1948	1952	All right, religious: The Lord giveth -
1952	1956	- and He just kept on giving, did he not?
1956	1957	Fifteen.
1959	1964	Disgusting: Say, who mows your nose hair?
1964	1966	Sixteen.
1967	1972	Paranoid: Keep that guy away from my cocaine!
1972	1974	Seventeen.
1974	1979	Aromatic: It must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and smell the coffee -
1979	1982	- in Brazil. - Eighteen.
1982	1984	Appreciative: Oh, how original.
1984	1987	Most people just have their teeth capped.
1987	1989	Nineteen.
1990	1992	All right...
1993	1996	You can do it, C.D., one more.
1997	2002	Dirty: Your name would not be Dick, would it?
2005	2007	You smartarse son of a bitch!
2007	2010	You flat-faced, flat-nosed flathead.
2017	2020	Has he fallen yet?
2025	2029	Did that copy of "Being and Nothingness" by Jean Paul...
2029	2033	Jean Paul Sartre? Yes, it did. I have it here, it is paid for.
2033	2038	- Great, thank you. - De rien... Il n'y a pas de quoi.
2039	2042	- Okay. - Do not mention it, bro.
2044	2048	"Therefore, my body is a conscious structure of my consciousness."
2049	2053	Thank you, Chris. I was too embarrassed to go and ask for it myself.
2054	2056	A little light reading, Andy?
2057	2060	I got $9,000 for the house this summer.
2060	2064	- Which one of the five? - The one on Rush Street.
2064	2069	- You are soaking Roxanne for $9,000? - I am not.
2069	2074	- You like her, do you not? - What is there not to like?
2074	2078	- Why do you not ask her out? - No, I cannot.
2078	2081	I have a 3 o'clock and a 5 o'clock, the women are lined up...
2082	2084	Mostly because of the old saying -
2084	2088	- about a man's nose relating to the size of...
2088	2092	- The size of what? - Come on, everybody knows this.
2092	2096	Hey, Sophie. Do you know the old saying about a man's nose?
2096	2101	You mean how the size of a man's nose relates to the size of his...?
2101	2103	Oh, my God!
2103	2105	I love doing it to them.
2106	2110	- Your tea, sir... and picks. - Thank you.
2111	2114	So, why do you not ask her out?
2115	2119	Sometimes I take a walk at night and I see couples walking, holding hands -
2119	2123	- and I look at them and I think: "Why not me?"
2123	2127	Then I catch my shadow on the wall...
2127	2132	- Why do you not get that nose job? - I did.
2132	2136	It is the word: Rhinoplasty. It is as unpleasant -
2136	2138	- as haemorrhoids.
2138	2141	Those two words you do not want to get involved in.
2141	2147	What about cosmetics? Shading along the sides, down the slope, a bit on the end?
2148	2153	- It really helps. - No, not for me. I cannot wear make up.
2153	2156	You should have stayed last night.
2156	2159	You were great, we were impressed.
2159	2161	Roxanne went on and on about you.
2162	2163	She did?
2163	2168	I think she is falling in love, but she does not know it yet.
2171	2175	What does she mean, "she thinks she is falling in love"?
2175	2178	It has been known to happen.
2193	2195	C.D., this is Chris McConnell.
2196	2201	It is a pleasure meeting you. I am sorry we have been missing each other.
2201	2203	Are you all right?
2203	2206	I know you have met the guys...
2207	2210	How is your room?
2225	2227	It is hypnotic, is it not?
2228	2230	It is huge!
2231	2235	It is enormous, it is gigantic...
2236	2241	They said it was big, but I did not expect it to be BIG.
2247	2251	Do you want to shoot some pool? Rack them up, we will play a game.
2253	2255	You will not kill me? The guys said...
2256	2261	- Ordinarily I would, but not today. - Why not?
2261	2267	Because yesterday she did not, but today... she does.
2276	2280	You finally have a sense of humour about your nose?
2285	2287	Rack them up.
2288	2293	Okay, turn on the hose. The secret to moving a hose is in the rhythm.
2293	2299	To the left: One and two and three.
2299	2303	To the right: One and two and three.
2303	2305	Now forward.
2308	2310	Now back.
2312	2314	I cannot stand this.
2330	2333	Turn it off! What are you doing?
2344	2346	Turn it off! Turn it off!
2346	2350	Get a good stream. Lean into it, trust it.
2350	2352	Remember: Water is your friend.
2354	2356	What is our signal for charging the hose?
2356	2361	Remember, it is like Big Bird... like on "Sesame Street".
2381	2383	No, not him again.
2384	2388	There he is... Back up a second.
2390	2392	Flirting with Sophie and Lydia again.
2392	2395	Charlie, can I talk to you?
2395	2397	Well...
2399	2401	All right.
2409	2411	Okay, was I right?
2411	2416	- Yes, it is ugly. - It really is.
2420	2424	- What I will say is a little forward... - Good.
2425	2429	There is someone I think I should get to know better.
2429	2432	Someone who I think likes me too.
2432	2434	- You know what I mean? - Yes.
2435	2437	I think he wants to talk to me.
2437	2442	I can see him trying, but he will not. I like him for that.
2442	2446	Maybe this guy needs you to make the first move.
2446	2449	That is why I am talking to you.
2450	2454	So... what do you know about this guy?
2454	2456	I know he is interesting...
2458	2460	- Different. - Yes.
2460	2464	Intelligent. Handsome.
2465	2469	- He is what? - He is handsome.
2469	2474	Is it not amazing? If you have feelings for someone, you see them as handsome?
2474	2479	- Everyone thinks he is. - No, not everyone, believe me.
2479	2482	What are you talking about?
2482	2487	Nothing. It is great that he is all these things.
2487	2492	I have only seen him a few times. We have never even spoken -
2492	2495	- we just exchanged some goofy looks.
2495	2501	- Why are you telling me this? - He works for you. Chris McConnell.
2502	2506	What is he like? No, do not tell me. I will let it unfold.
2507	2512	Since you are working with him, maybe you could encourage him.
2512	2516	He may not say anything all summer and then I will be gone.
2516	2520	- If it comes up. - C.D., thank you.
2521	2523	I know I am forward.
2525	2528	You were really great the other night.
2528	2531	It is the first time I have seen anyone be brave.
2531	2534	I have been a lot braver since then.
2539	2542	This time I want you to do it. Cut it off!
2542	2545	I am tired of having a magnificent, fabulous, interesting nose.
2546	2549	I want a cute, petite, little button nose.
2549	2553	- Give me the American beauty. - C.D., you know I cannot.
2554	2557	Yes you can, get the knife. Cut it, Dave.
2557	2563	I cannot. Allergies to anesthetics are dangerous; you will go into a coma.
2564	2567	We will do it the old-fashioned way.
2568	2571	Do not be stupid.
2571	2576	- I want to look like Diana Ross. - What you want is psychotherapy.
2576	2580	I can hear it now: "Get used to it. $85, please."
2582	2586	Have you ever thought you were born with this nose for a reason?
2586	2588	Oh yes -
2588	2592	- like opening coke bottles.
2601	2605	Can I look at those nose cards one more time?
2605	2607	Yes, sure.
2630	2635	Hello darling, I have not seen you in a while.
2636	2640	She is so beautiful, I saw her in that bar...
2640	2643	- She is interesting, too. - Yes, did you see her legs?
2643	2645	She also has a sense of humour.
2645	2651	She wants to meet me? I cannot believe this; God, my third day here...
2651	2653	She is smart, too. Astrology...
2653	2656	- Astronomy. - Yes, right.
2656	2658	God, we will meet, really?
2659	2661	So what do I do?
2662	2665	How do I meet her?
2665	2668	How about you walk up to her and say hello?
2668	2672	No, then I would have to talk to her.
2673	2675	What are you talking about?
2675	2680	Around you guys I can relax and be myself... I am funny, you know that.
2681	2686	But around women I get a little... It is not that I do not like them.
2686	2689	I just get a little nervous.
2689	2692	Okay, get her telephone number and call her.
2692	2695	Pass. Then I would have to talk to her.
2695	2697	I wanted to talk to her really bad -
2697	2702	- but I did not, because that is how I would have talked to her: bad.
2702	2708	So every time you meet a woman with charm and style and legs, -
2708	2711	- you will turn around and run.
2711	2714	That is a great idea. It is brilliant.
2716	2718	It is a dumb game; why do we play it?
2718	2722	- Tough game? - We are on our way there.
2724	2727	- Do you know what "carpe diem" is? - Some kind of fish, fish bait?
2728	2731	No, it is Latin. It means, "seize the day".
2732	2734	There may be no tomorrow, so do it now.
2734	2737	Seek life now, while you have the chance.
2737	2741	- You think I should go after Roxannne? - No, I would not. I would wait.
2741	2743	Mail her a letter.
2745	2749	Okay, light the thing, see how you do.
2758	2760	C.D., come here. I have got it!
2769	2771	You have got it all right.
2771	2774	How to talk to Roxanne. I will take a chance.
2775	2778	The girl likes me, what am I afraid of? She is no rocket scientist.
2779	2782	Actually, she is a rocket scientist.
2782	2787	But of all the guys she likes me, right? So what am I afraid of? Nothing.
2787	2791	I will do as you said... I will write her a letter.
2791	2794	I have a way with words. I always crack the guys up.
2794	2798	This way I can plan what to say. I can craft it.
2798	2802	In a letter I can be... effer-goddamn-vescent.
2805	2810	- We cannot get it started. - I will be out in a minute.
2812	2816	- Andy, your coat is on fire. - Yeah, right.
2816	2818	So what do you think?
2818	2822	- What?! - He is on fire, get his coat!
2822	2824	No! Not the gasoline!
2826	2829	Can I help you?
2829	2834	Yes, I have a friend who is looking for a cosmetic, if one exits -
2835	2841	- a sort of a shading arrangement. Do you have anything in the shading area?
2841	2847	We have lots of blushers and things... What specifically is it for?
2847	2853	She has this feature that she would like to... de-emphasise.
2854	2860	I see, she has this extra large feature and she wants to make it look smaller?
2861	2863	I think a dark contour would be fine.
2864	2870	Great. How would she go about... applying this thing?
2873	2880	She would... just shade the area of the feature to make it look...
2881	2886	It would appear to be more shadows and less actual... acreage.
2886	2890	- I mean area. - I will take it.
2890	2893	- I will get a fresh one from the back. - Thank you.
2897	2899	I talked to Chris for you.
2901	2903	Great.
2903	2905	Do you think he will call me?
2905	2908	He wants to write you a letter.
2910	2914	A letter? Is that not usually at the end of a relationship?
2914	2919	No, it is really romantic, actually. I will explain it to you outside.
2919	2922	C.D., here is your blush.
2922	2926	- Could you giftwrap that for me? - Okay.
2926	2930	These items I decided against.
2933	2937	- Do you have a girlfriend? - No, it is for my sister.
2937	2942	- You have a sister? - No, it is for my sister's girlfriend.
2967	2970	Hi, Chris. No, I am not doing anything.
2970	2974	Just baking some eggs.
2974	2977	Sure, come on over. Bye.
2979	2982	You should read the letter before I send it.
2982	2985	Great, we will take a look at it.
2988	2991	- It is quite an operation you have. - Thank you.
2996	3001	- Let us take a look at that letter. - I think it is really good.
3002	3006	"Dear Roxanne, how is it going? Do you want to have a drink sometime?
3006	3009	If you do, check this box."
3012	3017	- How long did you work on this? - Today. Since noon.
3018	3023	Chris, that is a very long time. You cannot send her this.
3023	3025	What do you mean?
3025	3028	I like the concept, but it has to be more interesting.
3028	3030	I worked hard on that!
3030	3035	Take a pen, sit down and let me ask you a question: how do you feel about her?
3035	3040	- Me, about her? - How did you feel when you first saw her?
3040	3042	Horny.
3043	3047	Okay, you cannot say you felt horny, you have to change it.
3047	3051	You have to say, " I felt... moved, -
3053	3056	- alive... on fire."
3056	3058	That is beautiful.
3058	3061	How did you feel when you first spoke to her?
3062	3064	Like a dickhead.
3064	3066	No, you cannot write that.
3066	3073	You have to say, "I felt like a child standing in the sun for the first time -
3073	3076	- feeling only your radiance."
3076	3081	"Radiance"; I like that. I will underline that.
3081	3084	What did you do after you saw her?
3085	3088	I puked.
3091	3096	After seeing you... my only nourishment was you.
3097	3100	- C.D., you write the letter. - No, you do it.
3100	3104	You know how to say what I feel. You write it and I will sign it.
3105	3110	No, no, that is... dangerous. That is lying.
3110	3113	Not if you write what I feel.
3113	3117	I sign my name and you write what you imagine I am feeling.
3117	3121	- It will work. - What I imagine you are feeling?
3121	3123	It is half-written already.
3123	3126	You have to change that poetic baloney.
3126	3128	This is beautiful.
3128	3132	No, for Roxanne you need something startling -
3132	3138	- something so strange it would make her incapable of being reasonable.
3139	3142	- Can you do it? - It is an challenge.
3142	3144	Get your favourite pen.
3144	3146	These are good.
3147	3152	And some good quality paper that really takes the ink.
3152	3155	- Oh, the food! - I will take care of it.
3155	3157	You just take your time.
3180	3183	Come on, boys, line up.
3193	3197	- Six and a half minutes, not bad. - Let us get into our gear.
3204	3207	Let us go, boys. It is Operation Snowball.
3207	3208	Snowball!
3214	3216	Take the truck!
3232	3235	Snowball, come on.
3286	3290	Hi, how are you doing, Chief? All is well that ends well.
3295	3299	Boys, the ladder is up. Boys!
3300	3303	Wait, boys. The ladder is up!
3324	3329	Let me show you a double binary, just focus with this.
3330	3332	You will see it, I am on a schedule.
3334	3336	Roxanne, what is a light year?
3336	3340	Same as a regular year, it just has less calories.
3342	3344	What is it?
3344	3347	It is two pairs of stars revolving around each other, -
3347	3350	- but so far away they look like one.
3350	3355	- What keeps them together? - Mutual attraction.
3355	3358	That is fairly romantic.
3359	3363	"Strange attractors in my window of possible movement."
3363	3364	Say again?
3364	3367	"Passionate kisses I hope you will read with your lips."
3368	3370	- Roxanne? - Sorry.
3371	3374	It is something from a letter I got...
3375	3377	An amazing letter.
3377	3382	- You liked it? - No, I did not like it. I loved it.
3383	3385	- Whose letter? - Chris.
3385	3388	- He can write? - I am melting.
3390	3393	Let me show you that dumbbell nebula.
3395	3398	There is something I do not get...
3398	3403	The guy dodges me for days, so I think, "Okay, he is not interested."
3403	3405	C.D. tells me of the letter -
3405	3408	- so I figure it is about why he will not talk to me.
3408	3410	But it is not.
3410	3414	It was strange and... intelligent -
3414	3416	- and sexual.
3417	3422	Why is he writing? He only lives a block and a half away.
3424	3426	Charlie?
3426	3430	Do you want me to ask him out for you?
3432	3434	She wants a date?
3435	3437	C.D., it is all because of you.
3447	3449	Hey, what is the matter?
3450	3454	She wants to see me tonight? I cannot see her tonight.
3455	3457	I am already a wreck.
3457	3459	Relax.
3459	3463	You have to help me. If I talk to her, I will die.
3463	3467	Here is what we do: I give you something to memorise.
3467	3470	- I cannot memorise. - Anyone can memorise.
3470	3474	Say the Pledge of Allegiance. You memorised that, right?
3474	3480	Okay, I said, "I pledge allegiance to the flag of..."
3481	3484	...which country, I do not know.
3484	3487	We will think of something.
3500	3504	- No letter this time, just face to face. - Yes.
3505	3510	- Do you want to sit outside? - Do I want to sit outside? Yes.
3510	3514	- Here? - Here on the porch, yes.
3516	3520	- We can sit right here. - Great.
3524	3530	- It is a lovely evening. - Oh, yes... It is an exquisite evening.
3531	3538	Filled with... mysterious portents. Magic and romance.
3542	3546	- Why are you wearing that hat? - Why? ...Because...
3547	3549	Do not panic, stay calm.
3553	3557	Because tonight... I am a hunter.
3557	3562	Because tonight... I am a hunter. Hunting for words.
3563	3565	That is good, it is okay.
3565	3567	Am I your prey?
3567	3570	Yes, but not a defenceless one.
3571	3575	Yes... but not a defenceless one.
3576	3580	Not a rabbit. You are a lioness.
3584	3586	Alert and sensitive...
3586	3590	Alert and sensitive to every mis-step.
3593	3595	Move a little closer to her.
3596	3601	Therefore I must move silently, moving in towards you.
3602	3604	Reach out your hand.
3605	3611	I hand out... reaching to... Car three, proceed to the 279.
3611	3612	What?
3613	3616	Confirm, car three, confirm.
3616	3618	Confirm what?
3619	3623	Confirm my feelings.
3623	3626	- Confirm my feelings. - Yes.
3630	3636	Because there is a heart here... that wants yours to know -
3636	3639	- there is a possible 502 on Main.
3639	3642	Proceed to Main, confirm.
3652	3654	Are you not a hunter anymore?
3654	3659	Not a hunter? No, I mean...
3660	3664	It is really nice out, is it not?
3665	3669	It is really, really... what is the word I am looking for?
3669	3672	Nice, yes, that is it.
3673	3676	So, now you are the weatherman?
3682	3685	I loved your letter. It was beautiful.
3685	3688	Where did you learn to write like that?
3688	3693	- The usual places. - It seemed very extemporaneous.
3694	3695	Thank you.
3696	3701	Say something. Something wonderful like in your letter.
3701	3704	- Let us see. - You can tell me about the night.
3704	3708	The night... is very extemporaneous.
3709	3712	- What? - It is wild.
3712	3717	Yes... the night is wild. Like love can be wild.
3717	3720	Love is wild, wild and extemporaneous.
3723	3726	Say something romantic.
3729	3733	"Why do birds suddenly appear everytime you are near?"
3734	3738	- Is that not from a song? - They made it into a song.
3738	3740	You wrote the song?
3741	3745	No... but I like that song.
3750	3753	Use your own words.
3755	3758	You have -
3760	3762	- a great body.
3762	3767	Your knockers, I mean your breasts, are like melons...
3767	3770	Not melons, like pillows.
3771	3774	Can I fluff your pillows?
3774	3776	I have to go in now.
3776	3781	Wait! ...Were you not playmate of the month in June '85?
3789	3793	- "Can I fluff your pillows?" - I got flustered, I panicked.
3794	3796	You have to help me, it was working.
3796	3799	I do not think I could after that.
3800	3804	She wants somebody who looks like me and talks like you.
3815	3817	No, come here.
3818	3820	Do not make me do it.
3820	3824	Stand under the window, I will be out of sight.
3824	3828	- I whisper to you what to say. - Wait, what if she hears you?
3828	3830	Just call her.
3831	3833	Roxanne?
3840	3842	Go easy for once!
3842	3845	Goddamn it, what are you doing?
3845	3846	I am sorry, hold on.
3846	3850	- Listen to me, I have a lot to say. - Go away!
3851	3855	- I just want to tell you that... - That I am really built?
3855	3860	- No, nothing like that. - Tell her you were an idiot.
3860	3862	I was an idiot, Roxanne.
3862	3864	Wait, come here!
3865	3867	I... C.D. help me -
3867	3871	- want to say that I was an idiot.
3871	3874	I was... happy? dizzy?
3875	3876	Thirsty?
3877	3880	This is stupid. Stupid!
3881	3884	I was stupid and I was also...
3885	3887	Tripping? ...bumbling.
3889	3893	I was a stupid, bumbling... pointer.
3894	3895	Pointer?
3895	3898	No, no... stupid ass.
3901	3903	So why did you say those things?
3905	3907	Tell her you were afraid.
3907	3912	- Because I was afraid. - Of me? Afraid of what?
3912	3914	Tell her you were afraid of words.
3915	3917	- What? - Words.
3917	3920	Because I was afraid of worms, Roxanne!
3922	3923	Worms!?
3924	3926	What are you saying to me?
3929	3933	When I said "worms" I meant "words", Roxanne.
3933	3934	Give me your coat.
3934	3940	Words are all used up, they are hard to say, they have all been wasted -
3940	3945	- on the shampoo commercials and the ads and the flavourings.
3946	3951	Hollow, beautiful words. How can you love a floor wax?
3951	3953	How can you love a diaper?
3953	3958	How can I use the same word about you that is used about a stuffing?
3958	3961	I am exploding with love, but cannot use the word.
3961	3963	I cannot hear you.
3963	3969	It is because my words have to rise up, they have trouble finding you.
3969	3973	- You can hear me. - That is because your voice floats down.
3974	3978	One hard word from you at that height kills me.
3978	3980	Give me your hat.
3983	3985	Your voice sounds different.
3988	3994	Of course, I do not have to be careful anymore. I am protected by the night.
3995	4000	I can be myself, Roxanne. Oh God, your name is like a knife.
4000	4002	Stand where I can see you.
4003	4006	- No! - Why?
4007	4012	Only my voice, you do not need to see me, just listen to me.
4012	4017	I only have a minute to talk to you. Did what I wrote touch you?
4018	4020	It did.
4021	4023	It was eloquent.
4023	4027	No, not eloquent, just honest.
4031	4037	I am in orbit around you, I am suspended weightless over you -
4037	4041	- like the blue man in the Chagall, -
4042	4046	- hanging over you in a delirious kiss.
4048	4052	Yesterday, on the street... I swore I heard your name.
4054	4060	I turned and there was nobody there. Just five birds rising off the ground -
4060	4065	- and when their wings hit the air, I heard your name again.
4065	4071	Just for that second I was one of them, pounding out your name: Roxanne.
4071	4077	Roxanne. A word of two syllables locked inside my head.
4079	4086	You see... I am... and I will always be -
4088	4091	- the one who loved you without limits.
4091	4095	What are you talking about? It is too much.
4095	4098	- Go on. - It is working, go on.
4102	4109	This is my whole life right now. Standing here talking to you like this.
4109	4112	Saying things I wanted to say, but could not.
4113	4115	Why could you not talk to me?
4115	4119	I was afraid you would laugh at me.
4119	4123	- That is silly. - No, not if you knew.
4123	4127	When you are reaching for a star, there is a long way to fall.
4127	4131	I almost never let this moment happen.
4131	4135	Now I feel sorry for people for whom it never comes.
4137	4142	I love you. I have breathed you in and I am suffocating.
4143	4149	I am crazy, I cannot go on. This is all too much.
4149	4155	- I am starting to feel a little dizzy. - I am starting to feel a little drunk.
4156	4160	Because I have made you tremble up there, have I not?
4162	4164	Like a leaf on a tree.
4164	4168	- I want to make love to you. - Shut up, Chris.
4168	4170	What?
4172	4178	I was telling myself to shut up because this time I have gone too far.
4179	4181	I will be the judge of that.
4181	4183	She wants us.
4183	4188	C.D., it is okay. Sooner or later.
4188	4191	You can do it.
4197	4202	Do not think I do not know you and have not felt you beneath me.
4202	4205	I know you have imagined it, have you not?
4206	4208	Lying back into your bed with me.
4209	4211	I have.
4212	4216	There will never be another tonight.
4216	4221	Why should we sip from a tea cup, when we can drink from the river?
4222	4227	There is a tiny word; it is not a noun, it is not a verb -
4227	4231	- it is not an adjective, I do not know what it is.
4231	4235	But if you said it to me tonight, all this blackness would go away.
4236	4240	You and I would be connected by a tunnel of light.
4242	4246	- What is the word, Chris? - Yes.
4255	4256	Yes.
4258	4259	Yes, Chris.
4263	4266	Great, we did it.
4269	4273	C.D., we were great.
4275	4277	I think I am in love.
4279	4282	Oh God, I did it!
4293	4298	Ooh, C.D., are you all right? Did you hurt yourself?
4298	4300	- Where am I? - You are in Nelson.
4301	4305	Nelson? I am home. They brought me home.
4305	4309	- What day is it? - Friday. "Dallas" is on.
4309	4313	Friday? Then it took no time. It did not exist in time.
4315	4318	Suddenly a spacecraft landed right in front of me.
4320	4322	I have read about it. Did it have lights?
4322	4327	Lights? You never saw so many lights. It was like Broadway.
4327	4332	A creature with big suckers on his palms came out, he walked like this.
4334	4336	He put his palms right in my face, -
4336	4339	- took me over to Roxanne's to observe me.
4339	4341	At Roxanne's house?
4342	4346	This is bullshit; we will miss "Dallas". Let us go.
4348	4351	- You think I am nuts. - No.
4351	4353	They asked me about older women.
4353	4357	They wanted to have sex with them here in Nelson.
4357	4362	They will start a colony of supermen who will have sex with older women because:
4362	4364	"They really know what they are doing."
4364	4367	It has been so long.
4367	4370	Do you believe in these creatures -
4370	4373	- wanting to have sex with older women?
4374	4377	Let us go and check it out.
4395	4400	God, I was nervous last night. Uncomfortable.
4400	4402	I did not say anything, I am too dumb -
4402	4405	- I mean, too smart for that.
4406	4409	What do you mean nervous? How nervous?
4409	4412	- Just real nervous. - Really nervous?
4415	4419	You mean so nervous you could not...
4419	4422	God, come on, it is embarrassing.
4426	4429	Look, I could not do it -
4430	4432	- the third time.
4432	4434	The moment we have all been waiting for.
4434	4438	Let Oktoberfest... begin!
4441	4444	You cannot get anything going here!
4447	4450	Is C.D. in?
4456	4458	I am catching a plane in 20 minutes.
4458	4461	- Why? - I got a call from the university.
4461	4465	- I was right about the comet. - Fantastic!
4466	4469	I wanted to tell you first.
4469	4473	Congratulations, that is great. You are famous.
4473	4477	- Is Chris around? - No, I have not seen him.
4477	4479	Maybe you can tell him where I am?
4480	4483	I will be gone for about a week. Here is my address.
4483	4485	Ask him to write me.
4485	4488	Tell him to knock me over.
4490	4495	I was walking on air, now I am walking on feathers, on pillows on air.
4502	4504	A beer?
4504	4509	- Draft? - Yes, but I can just put on my sweater.
4511	4517	That is so funny. There are so many guys in here with no sense of humour.
4519	4522	I think a sense of humour is important.
4522	4525	I think it is really important, too.
4528	4532	- A hand of low-ball for your drink. - What is low-ball?
4532	4535	You try to get the worst hand.
4536	4539	Okay, a low-ball for a high-ball.
4542	4544	You are a riot.
4548	4551	You could be a dealer in Vegas.
4551	4556	I went to Tahoe with my girlfriend. We will move there in 3 days.
4558	4562	They like young cocktail waitresses there; you can make big money.
4563	4566	I heard one girl got a $1 0,000 tip from a lucky gambler.
4566	4568	10 grand?
4569	4571	That would be nice.
4571	4576	When I get older I will move to Reno; they like older cocktail waitresses.
4576	4580	It is only 60 miles away... What have you got?
4580	4584	I have a nine, seven, five, three and a deuce.
4585	4588	That is the worst hand I ever saw.
4589	4591	You win.
4595	4598	- Where are you from? - Albuquerque.
4598	4603	A-l-b-u-q-u-e-r-q-u-e... It is an old bar bet.
4606	4608	Do you know where I want to go?
4608	4610	San Fransisco.
4610	4613	I have been there.
4613	4618	It is great; I am really a 49ers fan not so much the Giants...
4618	4623	The Redwoods, you should see them. I would like to go there and just be.
4623	4626	I always take a meat sandwich with me.
4627	4631	It is great you have travelled. You are interesting.
4631	4633	I try to be.
4634	4636	When you find somebody interesting, -
4636	4639	- you become interesting to that person.
4641	4644	- Are you seeing Roxanne? - Kind of, but not...
4645	4648	I should quit talking to you, she is a friend.
4648	4652	No, we can talk. It is no problem.
4655	4658	Next you will tell me about New York.
4658	4662	- I have been to New York. - I was just kidding, you really have!
4663	4665	- My name is Chris. - I know.
4667	4668	I am Sandy.
4669	4671	It is good to meet you.
4680	4685	You loved the little birds so much you gave them this to perch on.
4775	4777	Thank you for the help, ladies...
4797	4800	- What is up? - Nothing.
4803	4805	Do you want a drink?
4807	4810	Yes, but if I ask for one more... Give it to me.
4811	4815	Ralston, could you bring us a bottle of wine, please?
4820	4825	What can you sit on, sleep on and brush your teeth with?
4830	4832	I do not know.
4832	4835	A chair, a bed and a toothbrush.
4836	4840	- Your wine is right here. - Thank you.
4843	4845	What is the point?
4845	4849	Sometimes the answer is so obvious you do not see it.
4849	4852	It is as plain as the nose on your face.
4852	4857	- You should tell her. - Tell who what?
4858	4861	Tell Roxanne that you love her.
4867	4870	- Actually, I already told her. - You did?
4870	4875	- Last week I made love to her. - Great!
4875	4879	It was not actually me, it was sort of me, but...
4879	4884	It was me who said all the right things, made her feel the right way.
4884	4890	It just was not the actual me who did... the honours.
4895	4897	Never have I seen such a dead place.
4897	4900	Dixie, did you serve tripe quiche again?
4900	4903	Why are you not wearing fur tonight?
4903	4908	Chris asked me to stand in for him. Roxanne called; she is coming to town.
4909	4911	I have to tell him about the letters.
4952	4954	Coming.
4956	4958	Just a second, I will be right back.
4969	4971	What are you doing here?
4971	4973	There was no one there.
4974	4977	- What? - There was no one there.
4987	4989	What is going on?
4989	4991	I will get it.
5014	5018	Probably just kids... Damn kids nowadays.
5023	5026	- Guess why I came back early? - The door again.
5026	5029	There was no doorbell.
5029	5031	There it was again, I heard it.
5031	5034	Probably some kids. I will get it now.
5034	5038	- There was no doorbell. - I will take care of it.
5048	5050	There it was again.
5051	5053	She might mention some letters.
5053	5055	You wrote her a few letters.
5056	5058	- How many? - Three a day.
5058	5061	Six days, six times three is eighteen!
5061	5063	Well, twenty.
5063	5065	Twenty or so...
5071	5073	Nobody there.
5075	5080	Chris... do you know why I came back early?
5080	5084	Every day, every hour you sent me something new.
5084	5087	I could not stand it. I had to see you.
5087	5090	It was just letters... Twenty or so.
5090	5094	- Think of what you wrote. - I am trying.
5096	5099	- Wait... I want to know the real you. - No!
5099	5102	The one I spoke to at the window.
5102	5104	This is the real me, good old Chris.
5104	5109	I like hanging out, lifting weights; I am into my body.
5109	5111	You do not have to do that with me.
5112	5115	I know you and love you from your letters.
5115	5117	Is it not enough I am cute?
5118	5122	Do you not see, it would not matter if you were ugly.
5122	5123	No!
5124	5127	- Teach me what you know. - I can play the guitar a little.
5127	5130	- We could travel. - No, I hate pasta.
5130	5134	- I want to go to concerts with you. - We could... boogie, or what?
5134	5137	- We can just talk, Chris. - Talk?
5138	5140	Roxanne, I -
5141	5143	- am feeling a little...
5143	5146	I am not feeling well, I have to go.
5179	5182	So? Are you coming or not?
5183	5185	Yes.
5188	5192	- Will you tell her? - I cannot.
5193	5197	Chris, you have to tell her, it is not nice.
5198	5202	Do you have any paper? I could write her.
5202	5205	I have experience at that.
5205	5209	I have some in my glove compartment. I will get it.
5216	5222	Roxanne called. She sounded really weird, she wants you to come over right away.
5223	5228	- Jerry, it is a re-match. - He owes me 50 bucks.
5237	5238	Come in.
5245	5249	- What is it? - Read this.
5252	5257	"Dear Roxanne. I have met someone else, and she is real cute, too.
5257	5261	I hope I have not hurt you, but I probably did.
5261	5266	It was really nice knowing you, and now I am going to be a dealer in Tahoe.
5267	5269	Yours truly -
5269	5272	- t-r-u-l-e-y, Chris."
5275	5279	Then I found this along with it under the door.
5285	5289	Read it... read it out loud.
5292	5295	"All day long I think,
5296	5300	'Where is she, what is she doing now?"
5301	5308	Occasionally, I see you on the street and I feel the nerves in my stomach -
5308	5311	- a wave crashing over me."
5312	5315	- It is so him. - Go on.
5317	5320	"I remember everything about you; -
5320	5325	- every move no matter how insignificant it may seem.
5325	5329	July 1 1, 2:30 in the afternoon.
5331	5337	You changed your hair... not that much, but I noticed.
5338	5343	It was as though I had looked at the sun too long.
5343	5348	I could close my eyes and see it again and again.
5349	5355	The way your hair moved, your walk, your dress, everywhere I looked."
5360	5363	It is nice, is it not?
5363	5366	It has a... I feel...
5367	5371	- Finish it. - I did, it just runs out.
5371	5374	You have to turn it over.
5376	5380	"C.D. wrote this. Call me. Dixie."
5383	5388	I went through all of the other letters. They are all in the same hand.
5388	5393	It was your voice under the balcony. Chris did not write the letters, you did.
5397	5399	Yes.
5400	5406	All this time right there in front of me, and I could not even see you.
5407	5411	You bastard! How could you trick me like that?
5411	5413	I tried to make you feel good.
5414	5417	- You played with me. - You should have guessed it.
5417	5421	- So, it is my fault? - The signatures do not match the letters.
5421	5424	You do not check that in a love letter.
5424	5427	Because you wanted to believe it.
5427	5432	All the romance wrapped up in a cute nose and a cute arse.
5432	5434	You even got me in bed!
5434	5439	- Yes, on your first date! - Only because you seduced me.
5439	5443	You went to bed with him too fast. One frilly word and you are horizontal.
5443	5446	I do not think I went to bed with him.
5447	5450	Somebody was up there, it sure was not me.
5451	5454	Then who? Chris could not have seduced me.
5454	5458	- That is just what I told Dixie. - You told Dixie?
5459	5461	I just mentioned it, I did not mean to...
5461	5464	You son of a bitch! You bastard!
5464	5466	How could you lie?
5466	5469	I tried to tell you how I felt about you.
5469	5472	It was a lousy way of telling me!
5472	5474	Just get out!
5475	5477	Wait a second, I am out. Get in!
5477	5480	- No, get out! - Get in!
5480	5484	- Get off this porch. - Fine.
5486	5489	Do not try throwing my hat at me.
5491	5496	Guess what the rest of the letter said? It said, "P.S. I was only kidding."
5497	5501	- Ten more seconds and I am leaving. - What did you say?
5502	5505	Ten more seconds and I am leaving.
5505	5510	- What did you think I said? - Earn more sessions by sleeving.
5511	5516	- What the hell does that mean? - I do not know, that is why I came out.
5520	5521	Ten...
5522	5523	Nine...
5524	5526	Eight...
5526	5528	Seven...
5559	5562	Chris came and took all his stuff.
5585	5588	There is a fire somewhere.
5589	5591	Get into gear.
5639	5642	That is where I put Bossy.
5646	5648	We have got a burner, boys.
5649	5653	Two 2 1 /2 inch lines from the pump to the fire.
5653	5657	Three 1 1/2 inch lines from the hydrant to the pump.
5657	5659	If it gets to the station, the whole town goes.
5671	5675	I want a water curtain with a full fog pattern on both exposures.
5687	5689	One, two, three...
5693	5695	We are doing it, C.D.!
5699	5702	Take it easy, here we go.
5703	5706	Come on, Bossy. Let us go, boy.
5711	5714	You are all real goddamn fire fighters now.
5715	5718	To all us real goddamn fire fighters.
5719	5721	Thanks to us, no one got fried.
5721	5724	We beat this fire by a nose.
5728	5731	Well said.
5734	5737	I want to see you.
5738	5740	A toast.
5741	5747	I would like to say that I would rather be with the people of this town -
5749	5752	- than with the finest people in the world.
5780	5782	What are friends for?
5819	5823	When I close my eyes I see you again and again.
5823	5828	Your eyes, your face... the way you walk.
5829	5833	Your style, your wit...
5834	5837	And your nose, Charlie.
5839	5841	It does not quite work, does it?
5843	5847	I went inside and thought about why I was attracted to Chris.
5848	5851	It was not the way he looked... Well, -
5851	5853	- at first it was the way he looked.
5854	5859	It was how he made me feel. He made me feel romantic, -
5859	5863	- intelligent, feminine.
5864	5868	But it was not him who was doing that to me. It was you.
5868	5872	All these other men have flat, featureless faces.
5872	5878	No character... No fire... No nose...
5878	5881	Charlie, you have a big nose.
5881	5885	You have a beautiful, great, big, flesh and bone nose.
5886	5888	I love your nose.
5889	5893	I love your nose, Charlie.
5893	5895	I love you, Charlie.
5899	5903	- Well? - Are you kidding?
5966	5969	Oh, it is locked. It is locked!
5970	5973	Thank God, I have a key.
6035	6040	- By the way, I named the comet. - Oh yeah, good old Comet Kowalski.
6041	6045	- No, Comet Charlie. - That is nice.
6045	6048	Yes, it is my dad's name.
6049	6051	He'll be so happy.
