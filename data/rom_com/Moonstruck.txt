20	23	In Napoli
23	26	Where love is king
27	30	When boy meets girl
30	33	Here's what they say
38	40	When the moon hits your eye
40	43	Like a big pizza pie
43	46	That's amore
47	52	When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
56	60	Bells will ring Ting-a-ling-a-ling
60	64	Then you'll sing "Vita bella"
66	70	Hearts will play Tippy-tippy-tay
70	73	Like a gay tarantella.
75	80	When the stars make you drool Just like pasta fazool
84	89	When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
89	91	You're in love
93	96	When you walk in a dream
96	101	But you know you're not dreaming, signore
102	107	'Scusa me, but you see back in old Napoli
107	110	That's amore
130	131	Lucky fella
178	179	He looks great.
179	182	That AI Conti is a genius.
185	187	I am a genius.
190	193	If you're such a genius, how come you can't keep track of your receipts?
194	197	Al, how am I supposed to do your income tax with this mess here?
198	200	Numbers, taxes, receipts--
200	205	I make them look better than they did in real life.
205	207	I'm an artistic genius.
207	210	Then how come you got butter on your tie?
212	214	Give it here. God.
215	218	You know what? I give you this. You make good coffee.
219	222	You're a slob, but you make good coffee.
222	224	Red roses.
225	227	Very romantic.
229	233	The guy that sends these really knows what he's doing.
234	235	The guy who sends those spends a lot of money...
236	238	on something that ends up in the garbage.
238	241	I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta.
241	245	- I'd be out of business. - What are you talking? I love flowers.
257	258	Thanks, Carmine.
266	268	- Are you ready? - Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
268	273	- Very good, Mr. Johnny. - We'll both have the Ticino salad.
273	275	- And I'll have special fish. - Good.
275	279	You don't want the fish. It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
279	281	Maybe you're right.
281	283	We'll have the manicotti.
284	286	That will be a base for your stomach.
286	288	You eat that oily fish, you go up in the air...
288	291	halfway to Sicily you'll be green and your hands will be sweating.
291	293	You look after me.
299	301	- You're getting very upset. - I'm bored with this.
301	303	- I don't understand. - Don't ruin the whole evening.
303	306	- Patricia, please don't leave. - Do you think I'm a talking doll?
306	309	I was just making a point about the way you said...
309	313	-the way you stated your aspirations. -You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!
315	318	Very clever. The height of cleverness.
321	323	Waiter.
325	329	- Yes? - Would you do away with her dinner...
329	331	and any evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka.
332	333	But absolutely.
337	341	A man who can't control his woman is funny.
342	346	- She was too young for him. - What's the matter, Uncle Bobo?
346	349	Tonight Mr. Johnny's going to propose marriage.
349	352	- How do you know that? - He arranged it with me.
352	356	When he asks her, he's gonna wave. Then I serve the champagne.
358	361	Good bachelor customer for 20 years.
374	377	- How's things? - Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.
377	378	No, l--
380	383	- I want to see the dessert cart. - Very good.
383	386	- You never have dessert. - Never is a long time.
400	402	What's the matter with you?
403	406	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
407	410	- Have some dessert. - I shouldn't.
410	412	- Will you marry me? - What?
417	422	- Bobo, take the cart away. - Very good, Miss Loretta.
422	424	- Are you proposing marriage to me? - Yes.
426	429	All right, you know I was married and that my husband died...
429	432	but what you don't know is I think he and I had bad luck.
432	435	- What do you mean? - We got married at City Hall.
435	438	-It gave bad luck to the whole marriage. -I don't understand.
438	442	Right from the start, we didn't do it right.
442	445	- Could you kneel down? - On the floor?
445	447	Yeah.
447	449	- This is a good suit. - I know that.
449	452	I helped you pick it out. It came with two pairs of pants.
452	456	It's for luck. A man proposes marriage to a woman, he should kneel down.
470	473	She's got him on his knees. He's ruining his suit.
477	479	Is that man praying?
480	483	- So-- - Where's the ring?
485	486	The ring.
486	488	A ring. That's right.
488	491	I would have sprung for the ring if it was me.
493	496	- You can use your pinkie ring. - I like this ring.
496	500	You propose marriage to a woman, you should offer her an engagement ring.
513	515	Loretta Castorini Clark...
516	519	on my knees, in front of all these people...
521	523	will you marry me?
523	527	Yes, John Anthony Cammareri.
527	529	I will marry you. I will be your wife.
549	552	- The check! - Right away, Mr. Johnny.
564	566	What about the wedding?
569	571	My mother is dying.
572	575	When she's dead, I'll come back and we'll get married.
575	576	How near death is she?
578	580	A week. Two weeks.
580	583	- No more. - Let's set a date. How about a month?
583	585	Must it be so definite?
585	589	Can we just say we'll be married when I get back?
589	590	Where? At the City Hall? No.
592	594	My mother is dying.
594	596	I want a whole wedding or we'll have bad luck.
596	599	For a whole wedding to be planned, you gotta set a date.
599	602	All right. A month.
602	604	- A month from today. - In a month.
608	611	- From today. - I'll take care of the whole thing.
611	613	All you gotta do is show up.
621	623	Come on.
626	629	- Call me when you get in. - I'll call you from Mama's house.
629	631	You make me very happy.
632	634	There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do.
634	637	I want you to call this number.
638	640	It's a business number. You ask for Ronny.
640	643	- Invite him to the wedding. - Who is it?
643	647	- It's my younger brother. - You got a brother?
647	650	We haven't spoken in five years.
650	652	There was some bad blood.
652	654	I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding.
654	655	- Will you do it? - Sure.
656	657	International Flight 604 for Rome...
658	662	with connections to Palermo is now boarding at Gate 43.
662	664	I gotta go.
664	666	You got your ticket?
669	672	Here, I got you these: gum and cough drops.
672	675	- Gum opens your ears when you chew it. - Yeah.
675	676	I gotta go.
688	692	This is the last call for lnternational Flight 604 for Rome.
697	701	- You have someone on that plane? - Yeah, my fiance.
701	705	I put a curse on that plane. My sister is on that plane.
705	708	I put a curse on that plane that it's gonna explode...
709	711	burn on fire and fall into the sea.
712	715	Fifty years ago, she stole a man from me.
718	721	Today she tells me that she never loved him...
721	724	that she took him to be strong on me.
724	726	Now she's going back to Sicily.
728	733	I cursed her that the green Atlantic water should swallow her up!
733	735	I don't believe in curses.
735	737	Neither do l.
763	765	- Mr. Johnny's, right? - Yeah.
768	770	Good night. The key's in it.
779	782	I've heard that song before.
782	786	What are you talking about? I've seen the way you look at her.
786	788	- It isn't right. - How do I look at her?
788	790	- Can I help you? - A spumante.
790	792	- So how do I look at her? - Like a wolf.
798	802	Never seen a wolf in your life. That's $11.99.
803	806	I seen the wolf in everybody I ever met...
807	808	and I see a wolf in you.
811	812	That makes 20. Thanks.
813	814	- Have a nice night. - You too.
815	817	- You know what I see in you? - What?
817	820	- The girl I married. - Come on.
820	823	Good night.
862	864	Hi, guys.
864	867	Sweethearts, how are you? Guess what happened to me today.
878	881	Hey, how long must I wait?
881	882	Come here!
887	889	- Hi, Pop. - Hi.
889	891	- Where's Ma? - In bed.
891	895	- You're not sleeping? - I can't sleep anymore.
895	897	It's too much like death.
899	902	Pop, I got news.
902	904	All right.
904	909	- Let's go into the kitchen. - Once again I start to pray
909	912	Let it please be him
912	916	Oh, dear God, it must be him
916	919	It must be him
919	922	Or I shall die
955	957	You look tired, Pop.
960	961	What's your news?
964	966	I'm getting married.
966	968	- Again? - Yeah.
968	970	You did this once before. It didn't work out.
970	972	- The guy died. - What killed him?
972	975	- He got hit by a bus. - No. Bad luck.
975	978	Your mother and I were married 52 years. Nobody died.
978	980	You were married two years, somebody's dead.
980	982	Don't get married again. It don't work out for you.
983	986	- Who's the man? - Johnny Cammareri.
988	992	He's a big baby. And why isn't he here telling me this?
992	994	He's flying to Sicily. His mother is dying.
994	998	More bad luck. I don't like his face. I don't like his lips.
998	1000	When he smiles, I can't see his teeth. What is he hiding?
1000	1002	- When are you gonna do it? - In a month.
1002	1004	- I won't come. - You gotta give me away.
1004	1007	- I didn't give you away the first time. - And I had bad luck!
1007	1010	Maybe if you gave me away...
1010	1012	and I got married in a church in a wedding dress...
1013	1016	instead of down at the City Hall with strangers outside the door...
1016	1018	then maybe I wouldn't have had the bad luck I had.
1020	1021	Maybe.
1021	1025	I had no reception, no wedding cake, no nothing.
1026	1029	Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.
1029	1031	- He did? - Yeah.
1031	1034	- That don't sound like Johnny. - Well--
1035	1037	- Where's the ring? - Here.
1038	1040	It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.
1040	1043	- It's a man's ring. - It's temporary!
1043	1046	Everything is temporary! That don't excuse nothing!
1046	1047	You're coming?
1050	1052	Let's go tell your mother.
1059	1061	Rose.
1069	1070	Who's dead?
1070	1072	Nobody.
1072	1075	- Loretta's getting married. - Again?
1075	1077	- Yeah. - Johnny Cammareri.
1077	1080	- I don't like him. - You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.
1081	1083	- Do you love him? - No.
1083	1086	Good. When you love them, they drive you crazy...
1086	1088	'cause they know they can.
1088	1090	- But you like him? - Yeah.
1090	1092	He's a sweet man, Ma.
1092	1096	This time I'm gonna get married in a church and have a big reception.
1096	1098	- Who's gonna pay for that? - Pop.
1098	1100	What?
1100	1102	Father of the bride pays.
1102	1103	I have no money.
1103	1107	- You're rich. You're just cheap. - I don't want to pay for nothing.
1107	1110	It's your duty as my father to pay for the wedding.
1110	1112	I won't pay for nothing.
1112	1114	He didn't used to be cheap.
1114	1117	He thinks if he holds onto his money, he will never die.
1118	1119	What's done is done
1119	1122	And I tell myself don't be a fool
1122	1126	Now he'll play that damn record and won't touch me when he comes to bed.
1126	1128	Have a lot of fun
1128	1132	It's easy when you play it cool
1142	1145	Look at that old man. How many dogs has he got?
1150	1155	- Keep your dogs off my lawn. - Come on.
1168	1171	Don't do that. She's asleep.
1171	1174	- She's asleep. - Look all the flowers on Foncica.
1174	1177	My brother sent her a blue flower.
1177	1181	I can only see things in my house.
1181	1185	Things in my house are very bad. I don't know what to advise my son.
1185	1188	I think he should pay for the wedding...
1188	1190	but it's important that he don't look ridiculous.
1190	1194	- Why don't you talk to him? - I will.
1194	1197	But I must find the right moment.
1197	1199	See that bella luna last night?
1204	1208	The moon brings the woman to the man.
1268	1271	Upstairs. Everybody upstairs.
1273	1275	Come on.
1300	1303	- Will you live here? - No.
1303	1306	- Why not? - Pop don't like Johnny.
1307	1309	We'll sell the house.
1309	1312	I got married before, you didn't sell.
1312	1314	Grandma was still alive.
1314	1319	Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married, gone to Florida.
1319	1322	If you and Johnny moved in and had a baby--
1322	1324	Ma, I'm 37 years old.
1325	1326	What's 37?
1326	1329	I didn't have Chiro till after I was 37.
1330	1332	It ain't over till it's over.
1334	1337	Johnny's got a big apartment. We'll move in there.
1337	1339	So we'll sell the house.
1339	1343	You know-- What-- I want to live here. I love the house.
1343	1345	Pop don't like Johnny.
1345	1347	No, he don't.
1350	1352	I'll get it.
1356	1357	Hello?
1359	1362	Yeah, this is Loretta Castorini.
1367	1369	Hello, operator?
1372	1375	- Yeah. - Yes. Shh! It's me.
1377	1379	I'm calling from the death bed of my mother.
1379	1381	Yeah, how was your plane ride?
1381	1385	The waitresses were very nice.
1385	1389	- My mother is slipping away. - How long do I have to wait?
1398	1401	-I can't talk long. -Did you tell her we're getting married?
1401	1407	No, not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
1407	1409	Well, don't wait till she's dead.
1409	1411	Have you called my brother?
1411	1414	No. I'm sorry. Not yet. I forgot.
1414	1417	- Will you do it today? - Yes.
1417	1420	Make sure he comes to the wedding.
1420	1423	Five years is too long for bad blood between brothers.
1423	1426	Nothing can replace the family.
1427	1429	I can see that now.
1431	1433	Loretta, are you there?
1434	1436	I'm sorry. I'll do it today.
1436	1439	And listen, Johnny.
1439	1442	- Call me after you tell her. - All right.
1442	1447	And don't stand directly under the sun. You got a hat. Use your hat.
1447	1451	I got my hat. All right. Bye.
1451	1453	All right. Bye-bye.
1454	1456	What did I do with that card?
1458	1460	How's the mother?
1460	1463	She's dying, but I could still hear her big mouth.
1485	1487	He didn't tell her.
1487	1491	You know, the woman makes him crazy.
1491	1493	Now who you calling?
1498	1499	Cammareri's.
1499	1502	Is Ronny Cammareri there, please?
1502	1504	Hold on.
1504	1506	Ronny, the phone!
1508	1510	Yeah, this is Ronny.
1510	1514	Yeah, I'm calling for your brother.
1514	1517	He's getting married, and he would like it if you would come.
1517	1518	Why didn't he call himself?
1519	1521	- He's in Palermo. - What's wrong can never be made right.
1521	1524	Look, just let me come and talk--
1524	1527	Talk to you! Animal!
1527	1529	What an animal!
1551	1553	Thanks, Mrs. Fugocci.
1553	1556	Here you go. Bye. See you tomorrow.
1556	1558	- Bye. - Come on, honey.
1558	1561	- Is Ronny Cammareri here? - He's down at the ovens.
1561	1564	- What do you want? - I want to talk to him.
1574	1576	This way.
1583	1585	- What? - Somebody here to see Ronny.
1587	1590	Somebody wants to see you!
1610	1614	- You come for my brother Johnny? - Yeah.
1614	1616	Why?
1616	1618	We're gonna get married.
1621	1625	- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny? - Yeah.
1625	1626	Would you like to go someplace so we could talk--
1626	1629	- I have no life. - Excuse me?
1632	1634	My brother Johnny took my life from me.
1636	1637	I don't understand you.
1637	1642	And now he's getting married. He has his.
1644	1647	He's getting his, and he wants me to come.
1649	1650	What is life?
1650	1654	- I didn't come here to upset you. - They say bread is life.
1655	1659	And I bake bread, bread, bread.
1659	1663	I sweat and shovel this stinking dough...
1663	1665	in and out of this hot hole in the wall...
1665	1670	and I should be so happy, huh, sweetie?
1670	1673	You want me to come to the wedding of my brother Johnny?
1676	1678	Where's my wedding?
1679	1683	Chrissy, bring me the big knife over by the wall.
1685	1687	I'm gonna cut my throat!
1687	1690	Maybe I should come back another time.
1690	1692	No, I want you to see this. I want you...
1692	1695	to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother Johnny...
1695	1698	on his wedding day, okay?
1700	1702	I won't do it!
1702	1704	She won't do it. Do you know about me?
1704	1706	- Mr. Cammareri-- - What?
1711	1713	Okay.
1714	1719	Nothing is anybody's fault, but things happen.
1719	1721	Look.
1724	1727	This wood is fake.
1727	1729	Five years ago, I was engaged to be married...
1729	1733	and Johnny came in here and ordered bread from me.
1733	1735	I said, "Okay, some bread."
1735	1738	And I put my hand in the slicer...
1738	1742	and it got caught 'cause I wasn't paying attention.
1742	1745	The slicer chewed off my hand.
1745	1748	It's funny, 'cause when my fiance found out about it...
1748	1752	when she found out I had been maimed, she left me for another man.
1754	1756	That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
1756	1758	Yes, that's it.
1758	1760	But that's not Johnny's fault.
1763	1766	I don't care! I ain't no freaking monument to justice!
1766	1770	I lost my hand! I lost my bride!
1770	1773	Johnny has his hand! Johnny has his bride!
1773	1776	You want me to take my heartbreak, put it away and forget it?
1789	1791	Is it just a matter of time...
1791	1794	before a man opens his eyes...
1795	1798	and gives up his one...
1800	1805	dream of happiness?
1813	1815	Maybe.
1835	1838	This is the most tormented man I have ever known.
1838	1840	I'm in love with this man...
1840	1843	but he doesn't know that.
1843	1846	I never told him, 'cause he could never love anybody...
1846	1848	since he lost his hand and his girl.
1855	1857	Where do you live?
1860	1861	Upstairs.
1862	1864	Can we just talk?
1890	1892	What are we painting here, the Sistine Chapel?
1893	1896	We should have been plumbers like Castorini.
1913	1914	What do you think?
1921	1923	Ten thousand eight hundred dollars.
1923	1925	That seems like a lot.
1930	1932	Look...
1932	1934	there are three kinds of pipe.
1934	1937	There's the kind of pipe you have, which is garbage.
1937	1939	You can see where that's gotten you.
1939	1942	Then there's bronze, which is very good.
1942	1944	Unless something goes wrong...
1944	1947	and something always goes wrong.
1947	1952	Then there's copper, which is the only pipe I use.
1952	1957	It costs money because it saves money.
1960	1966	I think we should follow Mr. Castorini's advice.
1966	1967	Yeah.
1977	1980	And then there's copper...
1980	1983	which is the only pipe I use.
1983	1985	It costs money.
1985	1987	It costs money because...
1987	1990	it saves money.
1990	1995	- What did they say? - The man understood me.
1995	1999	The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw I was right.
2001	2005	You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
2012	2015	I brought you something.
2015	2017	It's a present.
2026	2029	Oh, my God.
2029	2032	They're little birds and stars.
2034	2038	Birds fly to the stars I guess.
2082	2085	- What's that smell? - I'm making you a steak.
2085	2087	- I don't want it. - You'll eat it.
2089	2090	I like it well-done!
2090	2094	You'll eat this one bloody to feed your blood.
2110	2111	This is good.
2114	2117	- Where'd Johnny find you? - He knew my husband who died.
2117	2119	- How'd he die? - A bus hit him.
2119	2121	- Fast? - Instantaneous.
2121	2124	- When'd you get engaged? - Yesterday.
2124	2129	So five years ago you got your hand cut off and your woman left you.
2129	2131	- No woman since then? - No.
2132	2137	- Stupid. - When your husband get hit?
2137	2139	Seven years ago.
2139	2142	- How many men since then? - Just Johnny.
2143	2145	- Stupid yourself. - Unlucky.
2145	2148	- I've not been lucky. - I don't care about luck.
2148	2152	You understand me? It ain't that.
2152	2156	What's the matter with you? You think you're the only one who shed a tear?
2157	2158	Why are you talking to me?
2165	2168	You got any whiskey? How about you get me a glass of whiskey?
2185	2187	I'll call you later.
2211	2215	- She was right to leave me. - You think so?
2215	2219	- Yeah. - You really are stupid.
2219	2223	You don't know nothing about it.
2225	2229	Look, I was raised that a girl gets married young.
2229	2231	I held out for love.
2231	2233	I got married when I was 28.
2233	2237	I met a man. I loved him. I married him.
2237	2239	He wanted to have a baby right away. I said we should wait.
2240	2242	Then he gets hit by a bus.
2242	2245	What do I got? No man, no baby, no nothing.
2245	2249	How did I know that man was a gift I couldn't keep.
2249	2251	My one chance at happiness.
2251	2254	You tell me the story, and you act like you know what it means...
2254	2257	but I can see what the true story is and you can't.
2257	2260	That woman didn't leave you, okay?
2260	2263	You can't see what you are, and I see everything. You're a wolf.
2265	2267	- I'm a wolf? - Yeah.
2267	2272	The big part of you has no words, and it's a wolf.
2272	2275	That woman was a trap for you. She caught you, and you couldn't get away...
2275	2278	so you chewed off your own foot.
2278	2280	That was the price you had to pay for your freedom.
2280	2282	Johnny had nothing to do with it.
2282	2284	You did what you had to do between you and you.
2284	2286	And now you're afraid...
2286	2288	because you know the big part of you is a wolf...
2288	2290	that has the courage to bite off its own hand...
2290	2293	to save itself from the trap of the wrong love.
2293	2296	That's why there's been no woman since that wrong woman. Okay?
2297	2299	You're scared to death of what the wolf will do...
2299	2301	- if you make that mistake again. - What are you doing?
2301	2304	- I'm telling you your life. - Stop it.
2304	2306	Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
2306	2308	Because I have no luck.
2310	2314	He made me look the wrong way, and I cut off my hand!
2314	2316	He could make you look the wrong way. You could lose your whole head!
2316	2318	I'm looking where I have to to become a bride!
2318	2322	- A bride without a head! - A wolf without a foot!
2338	2339	Wait a minute!
2352	2354	What are you doing?
2354	2355	Son of a bitch!
2355	2358	Where are you taking me?
2358	2360	To the bed.
2361	2363	Oh, God. Okay, I don't care.
2363	2366	Take me to the bed.
2366	2369	- I don't care about anything. - I don't believe this is happening.
2373	2375	- I was dead. - Me too.
2380	2382	- What about Johnny? - You're mad at him.
2382	2385	Take your revenge out on me.
2385	2387	Leave nothing left for him to marry.
2387	2390	Leave nothing but the skin over my bones.
2390	2393	All right. There will be nothing left.
2410	2411	Let's eat while it's hot.
2411	2413	Where's Loretta? We're eating without her?
2413	2417	- She must be eating out. - She don't know what she's missing.
2417	2419	It's not like her not to call.
2419	2423	She's got a lot on her mind. We can talk about her, right?
2423	2426	- Everybody knows she's getting married. - I don't want to talk about it.
2429	2433	I think it's a great idea and about time.
2433	2437	What's she gonna do with the rest of her life if she don't get married?
2437	2439	I don't want to talk about it!
2441	2443	My father needs another plate.
2447	2451	Many years ago, when they told me...
2451	2453	you were marrying my sister...
2453	2455	I was happy.
2455	2456	When I told Rose...
2457	2458	that I was marrying Rita...
2458	2460	she was happy.
2460	2463	Marriage is happy news, right?
2465	2467	Rose, pass the wine.
2469	2472	I never seen anybody so in love...
2472	2475	Iike Cosmo was back then.
2475	2479	He'd stand outside the house all day looking in the windows.
2479	2483	I never told you this 'cause it's not really a story...
2483	2487	but one time I woke up in the middle of the night...
2487	2489	'cause of this bright light in my face...
2489	2491	Iike a flashlight.
2491	2493	I couldn't think what it was.
2493	2498	I looked out the window, and it was the moon...
2498	2500	as big as a house.
2500	2504	I never seen the moon so big before or since.
2504	2507	I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house.
2507	2509	Then I looked down...
2509	2512	and standing there in the street was Cosmo...
2512	2514	Iooking up at the windows.
2514	2517	This is the funny part.
2517	2519	I got mad at you, Cosmo.
2519	2522	I thought you had brought that big moon over to my house...
2523	2525	'cause you were so in love...
2525	2527	and woke me up with it.
2527	2529	I was half asleep I guess. I didn't know any better.
2529	2533	You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
2536	2538	You were there.
2539	2540	I don't want to talk about it.
2540	2543	What do you want to talk about?
2543	2545	Why are you drinking so much?
2547	2550	Old man, you give those dogs another piece of my food...
2550	2553	I'll kick you till you're dead.
2599	2601	You drank too much.
2601	2605	You'll sleep too hard, and later you'll be up when you should be down.
2657	2661	- What's the matter? - Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.
2670	2671	It's perfect.
2671	2674	I never seen a moon like that before.
2676	2679	Makes you look like an angel.
2682	2687	Looks like a giant snowball.
2689	2691	- Rita. - What?
2691	2695	Rita, dear, wake up.
2698	2699	Look.
2703	2706	It's Cosmo's moon.
2706	2711	What are you talking about? Cosmo can't own the moon.
2711	2715	It's that moon I was talking about at dinner.
2726	2727	Is he down there?
2727	2729	Is who down there?
2732	2736	- What would he be doing down there? - I don't know.
2742	2744	You know something?
2745	2747	In that light...
2747	2749	with that expression on your face...
2751	2753	you look about 25 years old.
2772	2775	What do you want?
2779	2781	Get out.
2828	2831	Why do you make me wait?
2831	2832	Come on!
2832	2834	Howl!
2878	2880	- Oh, my God! - What?
2880	2882	- What? - Take it easy.
2882	2886	- I was trying to do everything right. - Don't just become excited.
2886	2890	I thought if I stayed away from City Hall, I wouldn't have bad luck again.
2890	2892	- You're making me feel guilty. - I'm marrying your brother.
2892	2894	All right, I'm guilty. I confess.
2894	2897	The wedding's in a couple of weeks. You're invited.
2897	2900	How come you didn't be like him and be with your mother in Palermo.
2900	2905	- She don't like me. - You don't get along with anybody.
2905	2907	- What did you do? - What did I do?
2909	2911	- You ruined my life. - That's impossible!
2911	2914	It was ruined when I got here. You ruined my life.
2916	2918	- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did!
2920	2922	You got them bad eyes like a gypsy.
2922	2924	I don't know why I didn't see it yesterday.
2924	2927	Bad luck. That's it. Is that all I'm ever gonna have?
2927	2931	I should have taken a rock and killed myself years ago.
2931	2935	I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me? Last night never happened.
2935	2938	You and I are gonna take this to our coffins.
2939	2941	- I can't do that. - Why not?
2941	2943	I'm in love with you.
2946	2948	Snap out of it!
2948	2950	- I can't. - Then I must never see you again...
2950	2955	and the bad blood will have to stay between you and Johnny forever.
2955	2957	- And you won't come to the wedding. - I'll come to the wedding.
2957	2960	- I'm telling you, you can't come! - He wants me to come.
2960	2963	That's because he don't know.
2963	2965	Now wait a minute. Honey, listen.
2965	2969	All right. I won't come to the wedding, provided one thing.
2969	2972	- What? - You come with me tonight to the opera.
2972	2975	- What are you talking about? - I love two things.
2975	2977	I love you, and I love the opera.
2977	2981	If I can have the two things that I love together for one night...
2981	2983	I would be satisfied to give up--
2983	2986	Christ. To give up the rest of my life.
2986	2988	All right.
2989	2991	- Meet me at the Met. - All right.
2996	2999	- Where's the Met? - You gotta--
3025	3026	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
3026	3029	It's been two months since my last confession.
3029	3031	What sins have you to confess?
3031	3033	Twice I took the name of the Lord in vain...
3034	3035	once I slept with the brother of my fiance...
3035	3038	and once I bounced a check at the liquor store...
3038	3041	- but that was really an accident. - Then it's not a sin.
3041	3046	But what was that second thing you said?
3048	3050	The one about once I slept with the brother of my fiance?
3050	3054	- That's a pretty big sin. - I know.
3055	3056	- You should think about this. - I know.
3056	3061	All right. For your penance, say two rosaries.
3063	3066	Be careful, Loretta.
3066	3068	Reflect on your life.
3068	3070	All right.
3097	3100	- Hi. - Where you been?
3100	3104	- I don't want to talk about it. - Just like your father.
3105	3107	I lied to him.
3107	3111	- He thinks you came home last night. - Thanks.
3116	3118	What's the matter with you?
3118	3120	- Cosmo's cheating on me. - What?
3120	3122	- Yeah. - How do you know this?
3122	3124	- A wife knows. - Mom, you don't even know.
3124	3127	You're just imagining it. He's too old.
3130	3131	I won't be home for dinner.
3143	3145	I feel great.
3147	3151	I got no sleep, but I feel like Orlando Furioso.
3152	3154	You were a tiger last night.
3156	3159	And you were a lamb, as soft as milk.
3160	3162	Shh! Lower your voice. They'll hear you in the back.
3162	3165	So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman...
3165	3167	- you don't worry about nothing. - Be quiet, Raymond!
3168	3171	- How about a date tonight? - What's the matter with you?
3171	3173	We'll eat some pasta. We'll roll around a little.
3173	3176	- What got into you? - I really don't know.
3176	3181	That crazy moon Cosmo sent over.
3181	3183	Hi, Aunt Rita. Hi, Uncle Raymond.
3183	3185	Hey, there!
3185	3187	You with the stars in your eyes
3189	3192	- What's the matter with him? - You got me.
3192	3194	You see that moon last night?
3195	3197	- What moon? - Did you see it?
3199	3202	Listen, I gotta go, okay? I'll take the deposit to the bank...
3202	3204	but I'll come back tomorrow and do the books.
3204	3206	Sure. You got a date.
3206	3208	What are you talking about, you fool?
3208	3211	Her fiance's in Palermo! What date?
3211	3213	Right.
3213	3216	- I just got a lot of things to do. - You got all that wedding stuff.
3216	3217	Yeah.
3219	3221	That's romantic too.
3221	3224	Isn't it romantic
3224	3229	Frankie, make me a bowl of minestrone!
3231	3234	What's the matter with you? You look crazy.
3234	3237	- I got a lot on my mind. - What?
3237	3239	- I got a lot-- - Don't tell me that! What's the matter?
3239	3242	- I don't want to talk about it! - You look like you're nuts!
3244	3246	I don't want to talk about it.
3265	3267	Take out the gray.
3267	3270	I have been wanting to do this for three years.
3270	3271	Let me show you some magazines.
3272	3276	And you're gonna need a manicure, yes.
3276	3278	You take her, Batina. She's gonna take out the gray.
3279	3282	Yeah, and someone will have to do the eyebrows.
3282	3285	- Look. Something nice and soft. - Wait a minute.
3285	3287	- Has anybody here been to the opera? - Not me.
3290	3295	- Bellissima without those ugly grays. - It's fantastic.
3295	3298	- You ever been to the opera? - No, have you?
3301	3303	Batina, you ever been to the opera?
3303	3305	- This is the color I would use. - La Boheme?
3305	3308	- I've never been there. - You're going to the Met?
3308	3309	Yeah.
3309	3313	She came in when she turned 40 and her husband left her.
3315	3317	- Bye-bye. - Okay.
3332	3335	Wow. Look at that.
3353	3354	Careful.
3361	3363	I'm home!
3364	3368	Don't everybody answer at the same time. Hello!
3571	3572	You look beautiful.
3574	3576	- Your hair. - Yeah, I had it done.
3578	3579	You look beautiful too.
3579	3581	Thank you.
3585	3588	I said I'd go to the opera with you, but that's all.
3594	3596	Come on, let's go in.
3612	3614	- Look at that. - Isn't it something?
3630	3633	Wow. Thank you.
3633	3635	For what?
3635	3637	I don't know. For your hair.
3637	3640	For your beautiful dress.
3640	3644	I don't know. It's been a long time since I've been to the opera.
3649	3651	- So, where are we sitting? - Come on.
3710	3711	Here we go.
3727	3730	- So, who's coming? - Just me. I want to eat.
3730	3732	Okay, I got a table for you right now.
3733	3735	- This all right? - Fine.
3740	3742	- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks.
3743	3747	- You dining alone tonight? - Hello. Yeah.
3747	3749	Let me have a martini, no ice, two olives.
3749	3751	Very good.
3754	3756	I'm trying to explain to you how I feel.
3756	3759	Every time I tell you how I feel, you tell me how you feel.
3759	3763	- That's not much of a response. - It's the only response I got.
3763	3766	- You want something to eat? - Not now. I'll wait.
3766	3768	Very good.
3768	3771	I really hate it when you use that tone with me.
3771	3773	Like you're above it all and isn't it so amusing.
3773	3776	- But it is, isn't it? - Not to me.
3776	3779	This is my life, no matter how comical it may seem to you.
3779	3782	I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I'm rolling in mud.
3782	3785	I think you like to roll around in the mud and I don't.
3785	3786	That's fair, isn't it? Now why--
3789	3791	Oh, my.
3798	3800	Sorry about that, folks.
3800	3803	She's a very pretty mental patient.
3806	3808	No, don't. Please, don't mind me.
3808	3811	Just do me a favor and clear her place.
3811	3814	Get rid of all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka.
3814	3815	Absolutely.
3818	3822	- I'm sorry if we disturbed you. - I'm not disturbed by you.
3824	3826	My lady friend has a personality disorder.
3826	3828	She's just too young for you.
3829	3831	Thanks, comrade.
3831	3833	It's nothing.
3833	3836	Too young? I just got that. You know how to hurt a guy.
3836	3838	- How old are you? - None of your business.
3840	3843	I'm sorry. That was rude.
3846	3848	Would you like to join me for dinner?
3851	3852	Are you sure?
3855	3856	I'd be delighted.
3856	3860	I hate to eat alone. It's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
3869	3871	- Signora Castorini. - Oh, yes.
3871	3873	- Your minestrone. - Thanks, Bobo.
3877	3880	-What do you do? -I'm a communication professor at N.Y.U.
3881	3883	- That woman was a student of yours? - Sheila? Yeah, she was.
3883	3886	Is.
3886	3887	Was.
3889	3891	My mother had an old saying. You want to hear it?
3891	3893	- Sure. - Don't shit where you eat.
3895	3897	I'll remember that.
3899	3901	- What do you do? - I'm a housewife.
3901	3905	- How come you're eating alone? - I'm not eating alone.
3908	3911	- May I ask you a question? - Yeah, go ahead.
3913	3915	Why do men chase women?
3919	3924	- Nerves? - I think it's because they fear death.
3927	3931	Maybe. You want to know why I chase women?
3931	3933	I find women charming.
3933	3937	I teach these classes I've taught for a million years.
3937	3941	The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago.
3941	3944	I started out excited about something, wanted to share it.
3944	3948	Now it's rote, a multiplication table.
3948	3953	Except sometimes I'll be droning along.
3953	3957	I'll look up, and I'll see a fresh...
3957	3959	beautiful, young face.
3959	3961	And it's all new to her.
3961	3965	I'm just this great guy who's brilliant and thinks out loud.
3965	3968	When that happens, when I look out there among those chairs...
3968	3972	and see a young woman's face...
3972	3974	and see me in her eyes...
3974	3977	the way I always wanted to be, maybe once was...
3978	3980	I ask her out for a date.
3983	3985	It doesn't last long.
3985	3989	A few weeks. A couple of precious months.
3991	3994	Then she catches on that I'm just this burnt-out, old gasbag...
3994	3997	and she's as fresh and bright...
3997	4002	and full of promise as moonlight in a martini.
4009	4012	At that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face...
4012	4016	or some action to that effect.
4016	4019	What you don't know about women is a lot.
4022	4024	That's not what I hear.
4032	4034	- What would you like? - Two white wines.
4034	4035	Yes, sir.
4044	4046	I'd like two glasses of champagne.
4050	4054	Canadian Club and ginger ale and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.
4054	4057	- What's that? - This was done by Marc Chagall.
4057	4060	- As you can see, he was a great artist. - Kind of gaudy.
4060	4063	He was having some fun.
4063	4068	- They get some turnout for this stuff. - It's the best thing there is.
4068	4072	I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
4075	4077	You haven't once said you like my dress.
4077	4080	I like your dress.
4080	4082	It's very bright.
4093	4096	Will you hold this? Thanks.
4096	4099	- May I walk with you a ways? - Sure.
4100	4101	Thanks.
4103	4106	- Do you live far from here? - Just up there.
4175	4178	- You knew that man? - Yes.
4286	4289	That was so awful.
4289	4292	- "Awful"? - Beautiful. Sad.
4292	4294	- She died. - Yes.
4294	4297	I couldn't believe it. I didn't think she was gonna die.
4297	4299	- I knew she was sick, but-- - She had TB.
4299	4302	I know. She was coughing her brains out, right?
4302	4304	And still she had to keep singing.
4305	4308	- Shall we go now? - Pop?
4310	4313	What are you doing here?
4315	4317	Wait for me by the doors, Mona.
4319	4321	Excuse me.
4325	4327	- What'd you do to your hair? - I had it done.
4329	4332	- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?
4332	4334	- Who's that guy? You're engaged. - And you're married.
4334	4336	You're my daughter. I won't have you act like a putana.
4336	4339	- And you're my father-- - All right.
4340	4344	- I didn't see you here. - I don't know if I saw you here.
4354	4357	Let's get out of here. I'll buy you a drink.
4357	4360	That woman was not my mother, okay?
4361	4363	That's my house.
4363	4366	- You mean the whole house? - Yes.
4367	4369	My God, it's a mansion.
4369	4371	It's a house.
4371	4374	I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
4374	4376	What exactly does your husband do?
4376	4380	- He's a plumber. - That explains it then.
4384	4386	Temperature's dropping.
4387	4390	- I guess you can't invite me in. - No.
4390	4394	- People home. - No, I think the house is empty.
4394	4397	I can't invite you in because I'm married...
4397	4399	because I know who I am.
4402	4405	- You're shivering. - I'm a little cold.
4405	4409	You're a little boy, and you like to be bad.
4409	4413	We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
4413	4415	I'm too old for you.
4415	4418	I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
4420	4422	Good night.
4423	4426	Can I kiss you on the cheek too?
4427	4429	Sure.
4437	4439	I'm freezing.
4439	4440	Good night.
4485	4487	Anything else, folks?
4489	4491	I think that's it, Al.
4491	4492	- See you, Al. - See you, Carmine.
4499	4502	- What do you want to do now? - I want to go home.
4509	4511	- Good night, Al. - Take it easy, Ronny.
4515	4517	God, it's cold.
4517	4520	It smells like snow.
4520	4523	You know, my mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody.
4523	4526	That Mona-- I mean, she's some piece of cheap goods.
4526	4528	Who am I to talk?
4529	4533	- What's the matter? - How can you ask me that?
4533	4535	- You're making me feel guilty. - You are guilty. I'm guilty.
4535	4539	Of what? Only God can point the finger.
4539	4540	I know what I know.
4540	4543	And what do you know?
4543	4547	You tell me my life. I'll tell you yours.
4547	4550	I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.
4550	4554	That don't make you no lamb. You're gonna marry my brother.
4556	4559	Why you want to sell your life short?
4559	4561	Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing...
4561	4564	a woman like you could do.
4564	4566	You waited for the right man the first time.
4567	4569	Why didn't you wait for the right man again?
4569	4572	- Because he didn't come. - I'm here.
4572	4574	You're late.
4578	4580	- This is your place. - That's right.
4580	4583	- This is where we were going. - Yeah.
4583	4585	You know, we had a deal.
4585	4588	You told me if I came with you to the opera...
4588	4589	then you'd leave me alone forever.
4589	4593	I came with you. Now I'm gonna marry your brother...
4593	4596	and you're gonna leave me alone forever, right?
4596	4600	A person can see where they've messed up in their life...
4600	4602	and they can change the way they do things...
4602	4604	and they can even change their luck.
4604	4606	So maybe my nature does draw me to you.
4606	4608	That don't mean I have to go with it.
4608	4610	I can take hold of myself.
4610	4613	I can say yes to some things...
4613	4615	and no to other things that are gonna ruin everything.
4615	4620	I can do that. Otherwise, you know...
4620	4624	what good is this stupid life that God gave us?
4625	4628	- Are you listening to me? - Yeah.
4630	4632	Everything seems like nothing to me now.
4632	4634	I guess I want you in my bed.
4634	4636	I don't care if I burn in hell.
4637	4640	I don't care if you burn in hell.
4640	4643	The past and the future is a joke to me now.
4643	4647	I see that they're nothing. I see they ain't here.
4647	4653	The only thing that's here is you and me.
4653	4656	I want to go home. I'm going home.
4656	4658	- I'm freezing to death. - Come upstairs.
4658	4661	I don't care why you come.
4661	4664	That's not what I mean.
4664	4666	Loretta, I love you.
4668	4671	Not like they told you love is.
4671	4673	And I didn't know this either.
4673	4675	But love don't make things nice.
4675	4679	It ruins everything. It breaks your heart.
4679	4684	It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect.
4684	4686	The snowflakes are perfect.
4689	4691	The stars are perfect.
4691	4694	Not us.
4694	4698	We are here to ruin ourselves...
4698	4701	and to break our hearts...
4701	4704	and love the wrong people...
4704	4705	and die.
4705	4708	I mean, the storybooks are bullshit!
4710	4715	Now, I want you to come upstairs with me and get in my bed!
4724	4725	Come on.
4803	4807	Nineteen Cranberry Street, Brooklyn.
4807	4808	Got it.
4812	4813	Hold it!
4829	4831	- How much? - Twenty-five.
4831	4833	- Twenty-five dollars? - Yeah.
4837	4838	Hold it.
4863	4865	Hi. I'm sorry to call so late.
4865	4869	- Moving in? - No, I came right from the airport.
4869	4871	Come on in.
4878	4880	Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
4880	4882	She's not home yet.
4882	4884	Take off your coat and come in the living room.
4884	4886	I'll make you a drink.
4886	4889	I want to talk to you.
4898	4900	- Thank you. Where is she? - Out.
4900	4903	I don't know where.
4903	4906	So, what are you doing here?
4906	4908	You're supposed to be in Palermo.
4908	4911	That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
4912	4915	A miracle? Well, that's news.
4917	4919	My mother's recovered!
4921	4923	You're kidding.
4923	4925	The breath had almost totally left her body.
4925	4927	She was as white as snow.
4927	4932	Then she completely pulled back from death...
4932	4934	and stood up...
4934	4936	and put on her clothes...
4936	4939	and began to cook for everyone in the house:
4939	4943	the mourners and me and herself.
4943	4946	She ate a meal that could choke a pig.
4946	4948	- That's incredible. - Yes.
4953	4955	Hi, Pop.
4958	4960	Oh, my God.
4961	4964	Is he all right?
4964	4966	My father-in-law has this wrong idea...
4966	4968	in his head.
4970	4972	Listen, Johnny...
4972	4974	there's a question I want to ask.
4974	4977	I want you to tell me the truth, if you can.
4980	4982	Why do men chase women?
4988	4990	There's the Bible story.
4991	4996	God took a rib from Adam and made Eve.
4998	5001	Now maybe men chase women to get the rib back.
5001	5004	When God took the rib...
5004	5007	He left a big hole there...
5007	5009	a place where there used to be something.
5009	5012	And the women have that.
5012	5013	Now maybe...
5013	5015	just maybe...
5015	5019	a man isn't complete as a man...
5019	5021	without a woman.
5022	5024	Why would a man need...
5024	5026	more than one woman?
5028	5029	I don't know.
5031	5032	Maybe because he fears death.
5034	5037	That's it. That's the reason.
5037	5038	I don't know!
5040	5045	Thank you for answering my question.
5053	5054	Hello, Mr. Castorini.
5059	5062	- Where you been? - I don't know, Rose.
5062	5064	I don't know where I've been or where I'm going.
5064	5065	All right?
5067	5069	You should have your eyes open.
5069	5072	- I have my eyes open. - Yeah?
5072	5075	Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
5075	5077	I don't know what you mean.
5077	5079	I know you don't. That's the point.
5079	5082	- I'll say no more. - You haven't said anything.
5082	5085	And that's all I'm saying.
5085	5086	- Cosmo. - What?
5086	5088	I just want you to know...
5088	5092	no matter what you do, you're gonna die just like everybody else.
5093	5097	- Thank you, Rose. - You're welcome.
5098	5100	I'm going to bed now.
5103	5106	- I'm going. - Good.
5107	5111	He doesn't like you, but thank you for answering my question.
5111	5113	- You don't know where Loretta is? - No idea.
5113	5117	Mrs. Castorini, will you tell Loretta that I'll come by in the morning?
5117	5119	We need to talk.
5119	5121	- Okay, I'll tell her. - Thank you.
5128	5129	Watch it. The house.
5225	5229	- What the hell happened to you? - I really don't know where to start.
5229	5232	- Your hair's different. - Ma, everything is different.
5234	5236	- Are you drunk? - No, are you drunk?
5236	5238	No, but I have a hangover.
5238	5241	- Where's Pop? - Upstairs.
5242	5245	Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
5245	5250	- What? He's in Sicily. - No more he's not.
5250	5252	- He's with his dying mother in Sicily. - She recovered.
5252	5255	- She was dying. - It was a miracle.
5255	5258	This is modern times. There ain't supposed to be miracles no more.
5259	5261	I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily.
5261	5263	He came right from the airport to talk to you.
5265	5267	You got a love bite on your neck.
5267	5269	He's coming back this morning. What's the matter with you?
5270	5272	Your life's going down the toilet!
5272	5276	- Cover up that thing! Put makeup on! - All right!
5276	5278	Ma, okay, fine! But you got to help me!
5278	5283	- Hurry up! - Oh, my God.
5284	5285	You get it.
5285	5289	Answer the door! Mother?
5298	5300	Hi. Is Loretta home?
5300	5301	Come on in.
5310	5311	It's not Johnny!
5315	5318	- Is Johnny here? - No, but he's coming.
5318	5321	Good. We can get this out on the table.
5321	5324	Hi, I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
5324	5326	I'm Rose Castorini.
5326	5330	- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.
5330	5332	Got a love bite on your neck.
5332	5336	- Your mother's recovered from death. - Good.
5336	5340	- We're not close. I'm not really moved. - You gotta get outta here.
5340	5343	- I'm here to meet the family. - Really, you gotta get outta here.
5343	5345	Anyone want some oatmeal?
5345	5346	- No, Ma. - Yes, Mrs. Castorini.
5346	5350	- I would love some oatmeal. - No, we don't want any oatmeal!
5350	5353	- Take your coat off. Sit down. - Ma! What? This is a--
5354	5358	- Thanks, Ma. - You're welcome.
5360	5363	Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
5365	5368	It's very good to meet you.
5370	5373	I have a feeling this is going to be just delicious.
5375	5379	- You're Johnny's brother? - Yeah.
5385	5388	- Don't look at me like that. - Hi, Pop.
5399	5401	What's the matter, Pop?
5401	5403	I am old.
5403	5405	The old are not wanted.
5405	5408	And if they say it, they have no weight.
5408	5413	But, my son, I must speak.
5413	5417	You must pay for the wedding of your only daughter.
5417	5421	You break your house through pride.
5421	5424	There. I've said it.
5424	5427	It's okay, Pop.
5427	5430	If she gets married, I'll pay for the whole thing.
5435	5437	Now you talking.
5442	5443	Let's eat.
5451	5456	- Have I been a good wife? - Yeah.
5459	5462	I want you to stop seeing her.
5496	5498	And go to confession.
5501	5506	A man understands one day that his life is built on nothing...
5506	5509	and that's a bad, crazy day.
5513	5517	Your life is not built on nothing.
5549	5551	- It's Johnny. I'll get it. - I'll get it.
5551	5554	- I think I should tell him. - I'll tell him.
5554	5558	- What am I gonna tell him? - Tell him the truth.
5558	5562	- They find out anyway. - You're right, Pop.
5575	5576	Why aren't you at the store?
5578	5579	Do you have something you want to tell us?
5584	5586	We just come from the bank.
5586	5588	Yeah?
5589	5592	My God! The bank! I forgot to make the deposit!
5592	5595	- She's got it! - I knew she had it!
5595	5597	- We didn't know what to think. - I forgot!
5597	5598	It was so weird yesterday.
5598	5603	- I know. I'm sorry. - Then we went to the bank and no bag.
5603	5606	- We never suspected you. - Would anyone like some coffee?
5606	5608	- Yes, coffee. - That's a good idea.
5610	5613	- What's with this? - I'll tell you later.
5613	5616	- I forgot to make their deposit. - Here, sit down. Have some coffee.
5630	5633	- So what are we doing? - Waiting for Johnny Cammareri.
5636	5639	- My name's Ronny. - Johnny's brother.
5641	5643	Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi.
5643	5647	- Hi. - Raymond Cappomaggi, Rose's brother.
5660	5663	Someone tell a joke.
5670	5672	I'll get it.
5680	5682	I thought Johnny was in Palermo.
5687	5689	It's Johnny Cammareri.
5703	5707	- Have you come to make peace with me? - Yes.
5707	5712	But you may not want to.
5712	5714	Ronny, of course I want to.
5714	5716	But, Johnny, your mother was dying. How did she recover?
5717	5720	I told my mother we were to be married, and she got well right away.
5720	5722	- I'm sure she did. - It was a miracle.
5722	5724	- Thank God. - Yeah.
5724	5729	- I have something I have to tell you. - And I have something to tell you...
5729	5734	- but I must talk to you alone. - I need my family around me now.
5739	5741	- I can't marry you. - What?
5741	5743	If I marry you, my mother will die.
5743	5745	What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
5745	5748	- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about a promise.
5748	5750	- He proposed! - Because my mother was dying.
5750	5752	Now she's not!
5752	5755	You're 42 years old. She's still running your life.
5755	5757	You are a son who doesn't love his mother!
5757	5760	You are a big liar! Because I have a ring right here.
5760	5765	- I must ask for that back. - All right, the engagement is off.
5765	5768	- In time you will see this is best. - In time you'll drop dead...
5768	5770	and I'll come to your funeral in a red dress!
5770	5772	What?
5772	5774	Will you marry me?
5774	5777	- What? - Where's the ring?
5781	5783	Can I borrow that ring?
5788	5789	Thanks.
5801	5802	Will you marry me?
5805	5808	Yes, Ronny. In front of all these people, I'll marry you.
5808	5811	- Do you love him, Loretta? - Ma, I love him awful.
5811	5813	God, that's too bad.
5815	5816	She loves me.
5823	5825	What's the matter, Pop?
5825	5828	I'm confused.
5838	5839	To Loretta and Ronny!
5845	5847	Come on. There.
5853	5854	Come.
5855	5857	- Your brother is here and you're-- - I don't want any.
5857	5860	You're part of the family. Don't you realize?
5860	5862	Come on, please.
5867	5869	Everybody, come on. Glass in hand.
5875	5878	To the family!
