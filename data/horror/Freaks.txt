32	34	We didn't lie to you, folks.
34	39	We told you we had living, breathing monstrosities.
40	43	You laughed at them, shuddered at them...
43	47	and yet, but for the accident of birth...
48	50	you might be even as they are.
52	55	They did not ask to be brought into the world...
55	57	but into the world they came.
58	61	Their code is a law unto themselves.
63	64	Offend one...
65	68	and you offend them all.
72	75	And now, folks, if you'll just step this way...
76	79	you are about to witness the most amazing...
80	84	the most astounding living monstrosity...
84	86	of all time.
91	93	Friends...
94	98	she was once a beautiful woman.
99	103	A royal prince shot himself for love of her.
105	107	She was known as the peacock of the air.
118	122	She's the most beautiful big woman I have ever seen.
123	125	Why, Hans, how you talk.
126	128	I should be jealous pretty soon.
129	132	- Don't be silly. - Don't be silly?
132	136	I've seen these women making eyes at my Hans.
137	139	Of course, I ain't jealous.
141	142	Frieda, my dear...
143	145	I have eyes for only one woman...
146	150	the woman I asked to be my wife.
162	163	Fräulein Frieda?
206	208	Are you laughing at me?
208	210	- Why, no, monsieur. - Thanks. I'm glad.
211	215	- Why should I laugh at you? - Most big people do.
215	219	They don't realize I'm a man with the same feelings they have.
226	227	Thank you.
229	231	You are so kind, monsieur.
240	243	- Nice. - Don't.
261	265	You must come to see me sometime, and we'll have a little wine together.
266	268	Thank you, Fräulein Cleo.
280	282	You're getting old, Jean.
282	285	Probably, last night you had too heavy a dinner, and now your imagination is...
286	290	But, Monsieur Duval, at first I could not believe my own eyes.
291	295	A lot of horrible, twisted things, you know, crawling, whining, laughing...
295	298	Be done, Jean. What were you drinking last night?
298	300	Nothing, monsieur, I assure you.
307	312	Monsieur, there must be a law in France to smother such things at birth...
313	315	- or lock them up. - All right, Jean.
315	319	If there's anything like you say on my grounds, we'll have it removed.
340	343	- Come on, let's go. - All of you! Tout de suite!
346	348	Go away, all of you!
348	352	Don't you know trespassing is the same as stealing?
352	357	I'm sorry, monsieur. I am Madame Tetrallini.
357	360	These children are in my circus.
361	363	Children? They're monsters.
363	366	Your circus. I understand.
366	369	So you see, monsieur, when I get a chance...
369	372	I like to take them into the sunshine...
372	375	and let them play like... children.
376	379	That is what most of them are.
381	382	Children.
392	395	Please forget what was said, madame. You are welcome to remain.
395	398	Au revoir. Come, Jean.
399	401	Thanks a thousand, monsieur.
401	403	A thousand thanks, monsieur.
404	406	Shame!
407	411	How many times have I told you not to be frightened?
412	413	Have I not told you...
414	418	God looks after all his children?
428	432	- Good evening, Madame Tetrallini. - How are you, Madame Tetrallini?
432	433	Big crowd tonight.
437	440	There she goes, taking them out to exercise.
442	444	Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.
446	448	"Just as they are represented on the banners...
448	450	"you will see them on the inside.
450	452	"Living, breathing monstrosities.
453	456	"Josephine Joseph, half-woman, half-man."
457	459	Have a cigar, Joseph.
459	461	You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.
461	464	Don't get her sore, or he'll bust you in the nose.
467	471	Come on. Hurry up. That's a boy.
477	480	You're all wrong. I didn't do it.
480	483	What are you trying to do, be funny?
483	485	You just don't understand.
486	489	A Roman lady...
489	492	Getting off the bull and scratching yourself.
492	494	Can't a Roman lady itch?
495	500	- Why don't you take a bath? - I did, but it's the bull that needs the bath.
510	513	I think she likes you...
515	518	but he don't.
529	533	Those flowers you sent to me, they were beautiful.
534	536	But not much beautiful as you.
539	540	Thank you.
542	545	And Hans, I don't like to ask...
546	549	but may I have the loan of another 1,000 francs...
550	552	until my money from Paris arrives?
553	556	- With pleasure, Fräulein. - Thank you.
557	560	I'll bring it to your wagon tonight.
563	565	Forget it.
566	569	- Maybe I was just fooling. - Fooling?
570	573	"Come, little girl, I want to take care of you."
574	575	And I fell for that.
581	582	Forget it.
593	596	So, you're quitting.
597	598	Is that it?
599	601	Maybe I'm only fooling.
602	604	You are not quitting me!
604	606	Because I'm kicking you out!
609	612	No, you don't. I gave you this.
613	615	Why, you cheap...
617	620	Don't you come around crying tonight, trying to get back in.
621	624	I'm through wasting my time and money...
624	626	on things like you.
626	629	Yes. Your time, but my money.
631	634	Ungrateful little tramp.
641	642	That is fine.
646	648	What are you staring at?
650	652	Didn't you ever see a lady move before?
654	657	I guess you've been listening to every word he said.
658	660	That's it.
660	662	Go ahead and laugh. It's funny, ain't it?
663	666	Yeah. Women are funny, ain't they?
667	670	They're all tramps, ain't they?
670	672	Yeah. Except when you can get money from them.
684	686	I'll be...
687	690	Who do you think you are, shooting off your head?
692	694	This is Phroso you're talking to.
696	698	Not any of those thugs you've been chasing around with.
698	701	- Now, you listen to me. - I didn't mean you.
702	706	- I had to take it out on somebody. - Yeah, you dames are all alike.
706	708	You're sharpshooting, you're cheap...
708	711	and how you squeal when you get what's coming to you.
713	716	Easy, kid. Cut it!
719	720	It's my own fault.
722	724	What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself...
725	727	is that I fell for that big hunk of beef.
727	730	So you finally got wise to yourself, did you?
730	734	The funny thing about you women is most of you don't get wise soon enough.
734	736	You wait until you're so old, nobody wants you.
736	738	Nobody does, most of the time.
738	741	You ought to be tickled to death you're washed-up with him.
741	743	You're not so hard to look at.
744	746	Give yourself a tumble. You'll make the grade.
746	750	- Your breaks is coming. - Coming? Gone, you mean.
750	752	Now you'll sit there feeling sorry for yourself.
753	755	No, I ain't. Don't you ever accuse me of that.
756	758	All right.
760	764	But one thing, don't go out filling your hide with booze, celebrating...
764	767	'cause fun what's got that way never done no one no good.
768	769	Get me?
771	772	I got you.
778	780	You're a pretty good kid.
780	784	You're darn right I am. You should have caught me before my operation.
790	793	- Hello, Phroso. - Well, well, well.
793	797	- Tomorrow night's the big night, Daisy? - Yes, the sister's getting married.
797	800	- And I'm thrilled to death. - She thrills at anything.
802	804	- Roscoe's a good kid. - She's only joking.
804	807	She'll like him lots after she knows him better.
808	809	That reminds me.
810	813	Close your eyes, Violet. Go ahead, close them.
815	817	- What did I do? - Pinched Daisy's arm.
818	820	What do you know about that?
824	826	Her master's voice is calling.
827	828	Getting fresh?
829	831	I don't like it one...
831	835	Come on, you'll have to hurry. We haven't much time.
835	838	So you were flirting with that cheap clown, were you?
839	842	- No, I wasn't. - He was doing a trick with me.
842	843	You shut up.
843	846	I'm marrying your sister, not you.
847	850	- I saw him getting familiar with you. - Come on, Daisy.
850	854	No, you don't. She's going to stay right here.
854	856	No, she isn't. I got to go.
858	860	You're always using that for an...
861	862	For an alibi.
874	875	Where are you going?
880	884	You don't look at others so much, do you?
884	887	Yes, I have seen you.
887	889	So that's how it is.
891	893	You got to be caught.
896	897	Well?
910	912	Come on in.
914	916	Help yourself to a drink.
917	918	That is fine.
922	924	Feel like eating something?
924	926	Always.
932	934	Prosit.
939	940	How many?
940	943	I'm not very hungry. About six.
949	951	How do you like them?
955	956	Not bad.
960	964	But you are strong. You are squeezing me to death.
964	966	And you'll like it.
966	969	You are taking my breath away.
981	982	You...
990	992	Now, here's something for your eye.
998	1001	But, Hans, my Liebchen, you have not been listening...
1001	1004	to a word I have been saying.
1005	1006	- Hans. - Yes, Frieda?
1007	1011	- You have not been listening to me. - Yes, I have, Frieda. I have.
1011	1013	Then what was I saying?
1014	1017	You were saying... What were you saying?
1018	1022	I was saying, tonight you must not smoke such a big cigar.
1022	1025	Your voice was very bad at tonight's show.
1025	1028	Please, Frieda, don't tell me what I do.
1028	1030	When I want a cigar, I smoke a cigar.
1032	1034	I want no orders from a woman.
1038	1042	This is the first time since we have been engaged...
1042	1044	you have spoken to me so.
1045	1047	Why is it?
1049	1052	Friedchen, I'm sorry. I...
1053	1056	- Here's our coffee. - There it is.
1056	1060	- Five lumps of sugar in each. - What? Five lumps?
1064	1067	The little ape sent to Paris for this?
1067	1070	Yes, Paris. We're doing very well.
1077	1078	But I don't like fruit.
1079	1082	You should eat a lot. It's good for you.
1082	1085	Next time, I tell him I like champagne.
1089	1091	- Who is it? - It's Hans.
1100	1102	- Who? - It's Hans.
1103	1106	My darling, your basket of fruit was lovely.
1107	1111	But I am... taking a bath now.
1111	1114	- Can't you come back later? - Yes, Fräulein.
1115	1116	Thank you, dear.
1122	1125	You'll spoil everything if he hears you.
1135	1137	What's the matter? You ain't singing as usual.
1138	1140	This morning I have such a big washing to do.
1141	1143	How's Hans?
1146	1148	I said, how's Hans?
1149	1152	Hans is fine. Danke, he's fine.
1153	1156	Frieda, something's wrong. What is it?
1158	1161	Nothing. Only...
1162	1166	That Cleopatra woman... My Hans...
1167	1170	- I cannot tell it. - She's still after Hans, ain't she?
1171	1174	Yeah. Always she's smiling by him.
1174	1177	Well, if she smiles by somebody I know...
1177	1179	she'll have to buy herself a new set of teeth.
1179	1183	Why is it we women always has got to worry?
1183	1186	It's always been that way. I guess it always will be.
1186	1190	Yeah. And, by me, she has no shame.
1190	1194	Always, when I can hear it, she says to him:
1194	1197	"Many thanks, my darling, for the flowers.
1198	1200	"Thanks, my darling," for this...
1200	1203	and "Thanks, my darling," for that.
1203	1206	Always something he has given her.
1206	1209	Don't you worry, Frieda. He doesn't love her.
1210	1211	That big horse.
1212	1214	Yes, but she keeps after him.
1215	1217	That's why I worry.
1221	1222	Why not pink tights?
1222	1227	You know. With spangles all around. It will show her figure off more.
1227	1229	Nein. No tights.
1230	1232	Without tights.
1232	1235	You know, that soft, flimsy, what-you-call-it stuff.
1235	1237	Where the figure shows through.
1238	1240	Why not like Lady Godiva?
1241	1246	Ja, that's it. And I'll hire her to ride the back of my bull.
1246	1249	Dummkopf! What have you on your shoulder for heads?
1250	1251	Swiss cheese?
1256	1260	- What's the matter, Cleo? - I think I strained my shoulder last night.
1260	1262	Give a rub, will you?
1265	1266	Farther.
1269	1270	Down.
1272	1273	Over.
1279	1281	It's so good to be rubbed.
1281	1285	- Our cards, lady. - What for?
1285	1287	A couple of rubbers from Berlin.
1295	1299	That reminds me. I had a swell dream about you last night.
1299	1301	- You did? - Yeah.
1301	1306	You were standing in a bathing suit on a rock. You know, like a statue.
1306	1310	The wind was blowing through your hair, the waves were washing around you.
1310	1314	And your figure. How it stood out. It looked great.
1315	1319	Say, you have got a good figure.
1321	1322	Do you think so?
1323	1325	- Sure. - Phroso.
1327	1329	Did you try that gag I told you about?
1330	1334	Yeah, I did, and it was a wow. Get up here, Johnny. I'll show it to you.
1334	1337	I did what you told me, and it laid them right in the sawdust.
1337	1339	Watch this, Venus.
1339	1341	- Hello, Venus. - Hello, Johnny.
1342	1344	Phroso, what else did you dream?
1345	1347	Then the dream changed. We was in Paris.
1347	1350	- Paris? - Yeah, at the opera, right in the front box.
1350	1353	- We were all dressed up. - What did I have on?
1353	1356	And did I look swell. Everybody was pointing at me.
1356	1358	They were saying, "That's Phroso, the clown."
1359	1361	And was I embarrassed.
1362	1365	- Did they say anything about me? - Sure.
1365	1368	- What did they say? - Hit me.
1368	1370	Go ahead. Hit me.
1371	1372	On the head. Hit me.
1383	1386	That's how it is. You don't think it's funny.
1387	1390	It's sad, is it? It will just panic them, that's how sad it is.
1396	1397	No.
1398	1401	When? Come on!
1403	1407	Come on, Venus. The bearded lady's baby's born!
1425	1428	- Ain't it cute? What is it? - A girl.
1428	1432	Oh, boy, that's great. And it's going to have a beard.
1439	1441	- How's the proud father? - Fine.
1441	1442	- What was it? - A girl.
1442	1445	Better luck next time. You may get a couple of Smith Brothers.
1445	1446	I'm trying.
1454	1457	Please, Violet, don't quarrel with him anymore.
1457	1460	If he's going to say anything, let him say it.
1460	1462	Don't let him "p-p-p" for an hour.
1463	1468	You're going to do as I say. I'm the boss of my home.
1468	1471	- Half of it, you mean. - Please, Violet.
1471	1475	Listen here. I don't want those tramps you go with...
1475	1476	hanging around my wife.
1477	1480	Be quiet. Hook up our dress.
1480	1484	If it isn't your dress I'm hooking up, it's something else.
1485	1489	And another thing. You got to cut out getting drunk every night, too.
1489	1491	- Is that so? - Yeah.
1491	1496	I'm not going to have my wife laying in bed half the day with your hangover.
1496	1497	Daisy, let's get out of here.
1497	1501	No, she don't. She's going to stay right here.
1501	1503	Come on. I got to go.
1506	1510	You're always using that for an... For an alibi.
1517	1519	Cleopatra ain't one of us.
1520	1523	Why, we're just filthy things to her.
1523	1527	She'd spit on Hans if he wasn't giving her presents.
1528	1530	Let her try it.
1530	1533	Let her try doing anything to one of us.
1534	1535	You're right.
1535	1539	She don't know us, but she'll find out.
1541	1543	There you are.
1548	1550	I peeked out of the corner of my eye...
1550	1553	and caught Madame Tetrallini giving us the once-over.
1553	1557	I guess she knows she's got a good act. One of the best in the business.
1557	1559	It isn't only our act that gets them.
1559	1562	We've got personality. We know how to sell the stuff.
1563	1567	Same way in the last town. Never heard such applause in your life.
1567	1570	Let me tell you something that everybody around here don't know.
1570	1573	We're only killing time with this circus.
1573	1577	We've got bigger time to follow, and we can do it, too.
1578	1581	Catch our act tomorrow night. We got something new.
1581	1583	Yeah? Can you do anything with your eyebrow?
1591	1595	Schlitze, what a pretty dress. How beautiful you look tonight.
1598	1600	You're just a man's woman.
1600	1602	You know what I mean? You.
1605	1609	If you're a good girl, when I get to Paris I'll buy you a big hat...
1609	1611	with a long, beautiful feather on it.
1615	1616	- Hello, Elvira. - Hi.
1617	1619	Hello, Jennie Lee. Look.
1621	1623	Hasn't Schlitze got a beautiful dress? Isn't that pretty?
1624	1628	When I get to Paris, I'm going to buy her a big hat with a long feather on it.
1628	1633	And if you're good girls, I'll buy you a hat with a bigger feather on it.
1641	1643	Why, Schlitze, what's the matter?
1648	1650	I'm sorry, Schlitze.
1659	1661	Did you see him? He was out there again tonight.
1662	1664	He followed you from the last town.
1664	1667	I know it, and if Eddie sees it, there'll be a fight.
1667	1670	- It ain't your fault. - There you are, Frances.
1671	1673	- Thought you'd gone to bed. - Hello, Rollo.
1674	1676	Hear that crowd out there again tonight?
1677	1680	I bet you thought the tent was on fire. Well, it wasn't.
1681	1683	Just the Rollo Brothers panicking them again.
1684	1686	But then, we do it in every town.
1686	1689	We're so used to it, it's getting monotonous.
1689	1691	You want to take a look at our act tomorrow night.
1692	1695	Careful. Don't waste any of it.
1698	1701	- Look how it sparkles. - Like your eyes.
1702	1705	Dancing, gay, like bubbles.
1710	1711	It's delicious.
1714	1716	Nice.
1716	1719	It comes by the finest vineyards of France.
1720	1722	And you sent for it especially for me?
1722	1726	For the most beautiful woman in all the world.
1727	1728	Darling.
1734	1737	Hello there, baby. Where have you been so long?
1738	1740	You're a funny guy, Phroso.
1741	1744	- Sometimes, you panic me. - Don't I know it?
1744	1748	I panic the world because I use my noodle.
1748	1751	I think up funny gags. I make the world laugh.
1752	1754	With me, clowning is an art.
1757	1759	Why the hat? The head cold?
1760	1764	- Thought you and me had a date to go out. - I forgot all about it.
1765	1768	Well, I'm into this now. I've got to go through with it.
1769	1772	Make it snappy, will you? I'm all dolled up for the occasion.
1772	1774	Sorry, kid. Can't do it now.
1779	1781	We'll make it some other time.
1783	1785	Don't feel that way about it.
1785	1788	I just got this idea all of a sudden. I've got to finish it.
1790	1793	- Funny gag, isn't it? - Yeah, I'm laughing myself sick.
1796	1797	Come on.
1799	1802	Honey, come on.
1803	1804	Now, now.
1806	1808	That's much better.
1813	1816	That's the first time you've ever done that.
1816	1819	- Ain't the first time I felt like doing it. - Yeah?
1827	1830	I don't mind telling you I've wanted to do this for a long time.
1839	1841	- We're all set now, Venus? - Yeah.
1842	1844	- All set now. - Yeah.
1844	1846	Please do.
1848	1850	Don't you want to make me happy?
1851	1855	- Yes, but I don't know what to say. - Just say yes, dear.
1858	1859	Will you?
1860	1863	- Yes. - Violet.
1872	1875	What are your kicking about? You've got a good wife. You're happy.
1875	1878	It's that sister-in-law of mine.
1878	1881	She wants to sit up half the night, reading.
1884	1886	- That's tough. - Tough? You...
1892	1895	- Good night, darling. - Good night, Fräulein.
1902	1904	Cleo's gone on a diet.
1910	1914	- It's awfully sweet of you to say that. - And I know Violet will be happy.
1915	1916	Here's Roscoe.
1917	1920	- Hello. - Roscoe, this is Mr. Rogers.
1921	1922	Glad to meet you.
1923	1926	- Violet and he are engaged to be married. - Yeah?
1927	1929	Yes, and you must come to see us sometime.
1930	1931	Thanks.
1931	1933	You must come to visit...
1935	1937	Come to see us sometime, too.
1937	1939	I certainly will. Thanks.
1946	1948	Who is it?
1953	1955	It's Frieda, Hans.
1961	1962	May I come in?
1964	1965	Yes, Frieda.
1982	1986	Now that I'm here, I don't know how to say it...
1986	1988	how to make you understand.
1990	1992	If you knew how I feel, Hans...
1993	1995	to come to you about her.
1996	1999	Frieda, I'm so sorry.
1999	2003	I don't want to hurt you, but ich kann es nicht helfen.
2004	2006	If you could be happy, Hans...
2007	2009	I would not care.
2009	2014	But I am happy, Frieda. Never in my life was I so happy.
2015	2018	No, Hans. You think it only.
2018	2021	For you, she cannot bring happiness.
2022	2024	Frieda, you don't know.
2028	2030	But I do, Hans.
2031	2034	You think because she's so beautiful and I'm just...
2034	2036	Don't, Hans. Please.
2037	2039	To me, you're a man.
2039	2043	But to her, you're only something to laugh at.
2043	2047	The whole circus. They make fun by you and her.
2048	2051	Let them laugh. The swine.
2051	2054	I love her. They can't hurt me.
2055	2056	But they hurt me.
2058	2061	Frieda, I have been a coward.
2062	2064	I should have come to you in the beginning.
2065	2067	Please forgive me.
2068	2070	Yes, Hans, I forgive you.
2071	2074	It is only that you should be happy I want.
2079	2081	You won't worry now, will you?
2083	2085	No, I won't worry.
2092	2094	Nice. Very nice.
2099	2100	It's platinum.
2101	2105	Say, where do you think that little polliwog is getting his money?
2107	2110	Listen at him. Getting so particular.
2111	2113	What do you care where the money comes from?
2114	2116	How much it's worth?
2117	2121	We got $500 for the bracelet, but this looks like thousands.
2121	2124	I think next time I'll take a fur coat.
2128	2131	Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.
2132	2134	- Jealous? - Me?
2135	2138	I'd squish him like a bug.
2139	2143	That's his knock. I'll get rid of him. Go quickly.
2148	2150	Come in.
2156	2158	What do you want?
2163	2164	It's about Hans.
2167	2170	Well? I'm listening.
2171	2173	It's behind his back.
2173	2178	Everybody's laughing because he's in love with you.
2178	2180	Go on.
2181	2184	I know you just make fun...
2184	2187	but Hans, he does not know this.
2189	2190	If he finds out...
2191	2193	never again will he be happy.
2194	2196	What makes you think that I am just making fun?
2197	2199	You're big. So beautiful...
2199	2202	And Hans is so little...
2203	2204	so cute.
2205	2208	Well, maybe I'm going to marry him.
2209	2213	If you marry, it will be at you they laugh and stare.
2214	2217	That's good. Nothing like being different.
2217	2219	Cleopatra...
2219	2222	queen of the air, married to a dwarp.
2223	2226	- A dwarf. - A dwarp!
2227	2230	Then it's not for Hans you care.
2230	2233	- It's the money. - Money?
2234	2236	You little mind reader.
2238	2242	He has told you of the fortune he has inherited.
2244	2246	Always he swear to me...
2246	2250	to tell no one until after we leave the circus.
2251	2253	A fortune?
2255	2258	And fancy you knowing about it, too.
2259	2262	Well, I can't be angry at him for that.
2265	2268	No. You cannot do this.
2273	2274	You wait and see.
2277	2280	Please. You can't.
2288	2292	A fortune. I bet the little ape's worth billions!
2294	2297	A fortune. Can you beat that?
2298	2301	A fortune. And I have him like that.
2301	2305	Shrewd little Hans. He knew enough to keep his mouth shut.
2305	2306	I could marry him.
2307	2310	Yes, he would marry me.
2318	2321	Midgets are not strong.
2323	2325	He could get sick.
2327	2328	How?
2329	2331	It could be done.
2333	2335	Done. I know it.
2370	2373	Come on, my little precious. Come on, let's drink.
2373	2376	Big, happy drink. Come on.
2379	2381	Quiet! Please be quiet.
2381	2384	Hey, Koo Koo, give somebody else a chance.
2387	2388	All right!
2390	2392	All right, professor.
2392	2394	A waltz, please.
2408	2410	Show him up, volcano. Burn him up.
2421	2424	Our wedding night.
2428	2430	What a thrill.
2430	2433	Never before did I think I should be so lucky.
2433	2435	Lucky?
2439	2442	I am the lucky one.
2442	2444	My little Hans.
2445	2446	My Cleo's happy.
2447	2449	- Happy. - Happy?
2454	2456	I am so happy.
2456	2460	I even could kiss you, you big, homely brute.
2478	2482	My little green-eyed monster.
2484	2487	My husband is jealous.
2490	2491	He loves me.
2501	2503	Come, my little lover.
2503	2508	Drink to the happiness of your loving wife.
2514	2517	Attention!
2517	2519	We'll make her one of us.
2519	2521	A loving cup.
2521	2524	We accept her, one of us
2528	2530	We accept her
2533	2535	One of us
2538	2542	They're going to make you one of them. My, big luck.
2551	2553	We accept her!
2556	2558	One of us!
2600	2604	They're going to make you one of them, my dear.
2609	2612	You dirty...
2613	2615	slimy freaks!
2617	2619	Get out of here!
2620	2622	You! Out!
2622	2625	Get out! You heard her! Get out!
2631	2633	You filth!
2634	2637	Make me one of you, will you?
2637	2640	Well, what are you going to do?
2641	2643	What are you, a man or a baby?
2644	2647	Please. You make me ashamed.
2648	2650	Ashamed. You?
2651	2654	Holy jumping Christmas!
2656	2659	What must I do? Must I play games with you?
2660	2663	Must mama take you horsy-back ride?
2663	2666	That's it. Horsy-back ride.
2668	2671	Come, my little flyspeck.
2672	2675	Mama is going to take you horsy-back ride.
2677	2679	- Come on. - Giddyap.
2693	2695	Forget it, Hans.
2695	2698	She is sorry. I'm sorry.
2698	2701	Didn't I told you she was drunk?
2701	2704	Didn't I told you we was only having a little fun?
2705	2707	Please.
2709	2710	I understand.
2712	2714	- Everything. - No, you don't.
2714	2717	I tell you, there's nothing between me and Cleo.
2718	2719	Be quiet.
2720	2722	Haven't you done enough damage for one night?
2722	2726	Don't you realize what I'm being accused of?
2726	2729	I ain't going to be blamed for something I have not done.
2731	2733	I don't blame you, Cleo.
2735	2737	I don't blame Hercules.
2739	2740	Only me.
2741	2742	Myself.
2743	2745	Now you're talking.
2745	2748	- Talking like a man. - You fool.
2751	2754	Always I should have known...
2755	2757	you would only laugh at me.
2758	2762	My sweet, I'd rather fall from the trapeze and break my neck...
2763	2765	than hurt your feelings.
2766	2769	Do you understand now? It was only joke.
2774	2776	Our wedding...
2777	2778	a joke?
2781	2784	Now I know how funny it is.
2785	2788	Hans the midget.
2791	2795	Hans... the fool!
2795	2798	Tell the divorce court. They'll laugh.
2799	2802	Everywhere, they're laughing.
2812	2814	- You give him too much. - No, I haven't.
2815	2817	I know what I am doing.
2818	2820	Come on, pick him up.
2853	2855	Doctor, what is it?
2856	2857	What caused it?
2860	2861	Poison.
2871	2874	A very bad case of ptomaine poisoning.
2877	2880	Doctor, did I do wrong, then?
2881	2882	Giving him mustard water?
2884	2886	No. Probably saved his life.
2897	2900	Never before did he drink like that...
2902	2905	but she kept making him, and making him.
2906	2907	Drink?
2935	2939	You better get Cleo to tell the doctor what she put in that wine last night.
2939	2943	- What you're talking about? - The stuff she put in the wine.
2943	2944	You're crazy.
2945	2947	You can't get away with it. I'll tell the coppers.
2947	2950	So, tell on your own people?
2950	2953	My people are decent circus folks.
2953	2956	Not dirty rats what would kill a freak to get his money.
2956	2958	You dirty little...
2964	2967	Your imagination's getting the best of you.
2967	2968	Yeah, maybe it is.
2968	2972	But coppers don't have imaginations, so I've been told.
2974	2977	Don't make me have to go to them.
3029	3031	- Cleo. - Yes?
3032	3034	It has been a week tonight...
3035	3038	since we have been married.
3039	3042	A week, since I have said...
3042	3045	- all those things to you. - Don't!
3048	3052	Never can I forgive myself for what I've said.
3052	3054	I've forgotten it.
3054	3058	Nothing matters except for you to be well.
3061	3064	So good you are by me, Cleo.
3066	3068	I must fix your medicine, or I'll be late.
3140	3142	I'll be soon back, my little.
3142	3144	Don't be lonely.
3145	3149	I'll never forget what you are doing for me, Cleo.
3150	3152	But it's what I want to do, my darling.
3155	3157	Now I must hurry.
3158	3159	- Cleo. - Yes?
3160	3162	Will you leave the door open, please?
3163	3165	Yes, my darling.
3215	3217	- Tonight. - They will be ready.
3218	3220	All right. You come to my wagon.
3230	3235	"I must hurry now and fix your medicine, my darling...
3235	3237	"or I will be late."
3240	3241	"Dirty...
3242	3244	"slimy freaks."
3270	3272	- He's waiting. - Fine.
3289	3290	Soon we go.
3322	3325	- You're imagining things. - No.
3325	3329	Then I hear Hercules tell Cleo: "Venus knows too much."
3329	3332	- Hercules? Venus? - Yes.
3336	3338	Thanks, Frieda.
3349	3351	My little, you must go to sleep.
3351	3354	Your friends better go now.
3354	3357	- I like them here. - No, Hans.
3357	3359	They can come back tomorrow.
3360	3363	I will give you your medicine and get you off to sleep.
3364	3367	Go on, all of you. Quick.
3377	3381	- What's this? - Give me that little black bottle.
3409	3410	Bottle.
3417	3421	You got this bottle of poison... to kill.
3448	3449	Phroso!
3457	3459	Get out, Venus!
3459	3462	Do I have to bust you in the jaw to make you get out?
3474	3476	Get out, Venus!
3477	3478	Help me!
3489	3491	Mrs. T!
3575	3578	Help! Please, help!
3588	3591	How she got that way will never be known.
3592	3595	Some say a jealous lover. Others...
3596	3599	that it was the code of the freaks.
3600	3602	Others, the storm.
3603	3606	Believe it or not, there she is.
3619	3622	But, sir, they insist on seeing you.
3622	3625	In all these years, I've seen no one.
3625	3627	Have I not told you that?
3628	3630	- Send them away. - Very good, sir.
3632	3635	- I can't see no one. - Excuse me, sir. You can't come in.
3635	3639	- No, sir. I have my orders. - Who's going to stop me? I'm in, ain't I?
3640	3642	Yes, you can, Hansie, old boy.
3642	3645	There's someone you've just got to see.
3645	3647	Why did you come here?
3648	3652	Please, Hans. Don't be angry.
3653	3656	Venus and Phroso have been so kind by me.
3657	3660	Please go away.
3660	3663	I can see no one.
3666	3669	But, Hans, you tried to stop them.
3670	3673	It was only the poison you wanted.
3674	3676	It wasn't your fault.
3679	3681	Don't cry, Hans.
3682	3684	Come to me, my Liebchen.
3686	3687	Don't cry.
3689	3690	Don't, Hans.
3691	3692	Don't cry.
3693	3695	I love you.
