2	6	If I told the truth you might think that I'm a heavy woman.
7	11	I've been longing for your call.
12	14	Sorry.
15	17	So how are you?
20	21	What?
22	24	What's so funny?
25	30	I never thought about having a date with you again. So I'm pretty excited.
36	38	Here we go.
57	62	I never asked you about your family. Are they fine?
62	66	They're fine. -You're from Tokyo right?
66	70	They bought a house in Chiba. Just moved in last month.
71	74	My father loves golf, living in Chiba is more convenient.
74	77	Really? We are not that close.
77	80	But not that distant either. Quite an average family.
81	84	Do you still work at the bar? -Yes.
85	88	Is that in Ginza? -It's in 4th street.
88	91	Called the "Stone Fish". Funny name. -the Stone Fish?
92	95	Shall I come for a drink? -Thank you...
95	100	...but the owner interrupts my private things.
101	104	If you don't want me to come of course I won't.
105	107	I'm just curious about you.
107	112	I won't lie to you, definitely not.
112	114	I promise.
118	121	Can I tell you the truth about the movie?
121	127	Someone else got the part? -'It's not like that.' the movie itself.
131	135	Actually the sponsor didn't like some of the story.
135	139	We had to suspend it.
141	147	In the worst case it might not come out.
148	152	Oh really? You might be hurt.
153	156	Not me. But you might be.
157	160	You read my composition didn't you?
160	164	I never thought about me getting the main part.
165	169	It's OK. The good thing is that I met you.
169	173	I felt wonderful seeing myself in the mirror.
174	180	Joining images of myself and beautiful things.
181	185	That's incredible, I trained myself hard to release pain.
188	192	That's why I could tolerate hard lessons.
193	196	But eventually I lost my precious ballet.
209	211	It's hard to forget about it.
212	216	But someday you'll feel that life is wonderful.
219	221	That's life isn't it?
236	237	Thank you.
240	242	Living alone is a hassle.
243	246	I have nobody to talk with.
247	250	There were some guys that approached me.
250	256	But you are the first one to support me.
257	262	Warmly wrapping me and trying to understand me.
263	268	Let's have dinner soon. -When will That be?
270	272	Sorry am I pushing you?
274	275	I'll call you.
276	279	Yes I'll wait for you.
291	293	Here is fine.
293	296	Please stop the car. She's getting off.
301	305	Thank you very much for today. -See you.
311	313	Good night. -Bye.
323	325	Take me to Okusawa.
351	355	Can I talk to you for a moment? -What?
359	362	Well well, the drapes are dirty.
363	364	What?
369	372	Well... -You found a girlfriend.
373	376	Am I right? -Bingo.
377	382	You look a little different, sometimes you even smile.
387	390	She is only 24 years old.
391	394	She's closer to my age. Must be very beautiful.
396	400	I'm the same as you. I like the beautiful ones. -Don't get cheated.
402	404	I'm much cleverer than you.
405	407	Have you proposed to her?
409	410	Not yet.
411	414	We are going away this weekend. I'm going to propose to her then.
414	416	Good luck!
418	421	I'll introduce her to you soon.
424	427	Let me check her out first. I trust my hunches.
429	432	Because you're in love now.
494	499	Well what can we do before dinner?
502	508	I know this place whose cook is very good. He provides very nice food.
509	513	But he has a terrible mouth.
518	521	There is a little museum close by.
522	526	If we leave now, we could still make it.
544	547	It's about 20 min. by car.
553	556	After that, we could go to the harbor.
557	562	It's a little harbor but it has a nice coffee shop.
562	566	They serve nice cheesecake.
566	568	Their desserts are...
630	632	Come to me.
638	639	Please.
659	661	Don't take off your clothes yet.
666	668	Please...
670	672	Look at my body.
709	713	I burnt myself when I was little.
718	722	I want you to know all about me.
738	741	You are very beautiful.
746	750	Please love me. Only me.
753	754	I understand.
757	758	Everybody says so.
760	764	But I hope you are different from the others.
765	767	Only me.
768	769	OK?
771	775	Only me. Please love me. Only me.
892	893	Yes.
894	897	Is that Mr. Aoyama? This is the front desk.
898	902	Yes. -I'm terribly sorry. You must be in bed.
902	907	We tried calling many times but there was no answer.
907	910	Thing is, your partner left.
910	913	We want to confirm your stay.
913	916	Sorry to call you so late, but we need to know.
918	920	Left?
929	931	What you are saying is she disappeared?
933	938	Nobody answers the phone. There's no way to contact her.
940	945	I don't know exactly where she lives either.
952	955	What happened in the hotel? -I told You all about it.
955	958	But normally people don't disappear like that.
962	965	We might have misunderstood each other some how.
966	969	I just want to talk to her face to face.
971	976	Yoshikawa, can you find out her address?
977	982	Aoyama, I've only got her resume.
982	984	It's impossible.
987	991	Why don't you forget about her. -I can't do that.
991	996	I can't finish everything like this. -I know I can't convince you but...
997	1001	I suggest you to forget about her.
1012	1014	You're saying...
1015	1016	That I...
1019	1022	went too crazy about a young girl.
1023	1028	Eventually being left alone like a pathetic old fart?
1030	1031	Yes, you are.
1035	1040	What's the matter with you? You said that you weren't born yesterday.
1041	1045	Whatever problems come up, you fix them, right? Oh come on!
1051	1052	What?
1055	1057	It's OK. -What's OK about it?
1058	1062	It's OK now. I won't ask your help anymore.
1063	1065	I'll look for her.
1076	1077	I'll look for her myself. -Aoyama!
1110	1112	Shimada Ballet studio.
1146	1147	Excuse me?
1149	1150	Excuse me but...
1262	1264	Are you...
1272	1274	Are you Mr. Shimada?
1276	1281	I'm the one who called you this afternoon.
1287	1291	About Miss Asami Yamasaki.
1292	1293	Go home.
1301	1303	Let me be frank with you.
1304	1309	Did you have any problems with Asami before?
1311	1315	I just want to know how to contact her.
1316	1320	And I'm looking for a hint.
1338	1341	Did you see her?
1344	1345	Yes.
1351	1354	Did you hear her voice?
1356	1359	What do you mean by that?
1365	1368	Did you touch her body?
1370	1373	Did you hold her in your arms?
1374	1376	How was that?
1377	1379	Was it good?
1384	1386	Did you smell her?
1417	1418	Asami...
1442	1443	Go home.
1457	1460	4th Street. The Stone Fish.
1462	1465	The Stone Fish.
1523	1524	No one is there.
1531	1533	Are you closed today?
1533	1536	That bar closed about a year ago.
1543	1546	That was huge mess. The owner was murdered.
1548	1552	Do you know an Asami who used to work here?
1552	1555	Asami? I don't recall.
1556	1559	Normally the owner worked here alone.
1560	1564	Asami was supposed to work here 3 times a week.
1565	1567	Some kind of a mistake.
1569	1572	Excuse me... Why was the owner killed?
1576	1581	I'm not sure but people talk about some sort of man problem.
1581	1586	She used to be associated with a music industry guy. She used drugs too.
1590	1594	Did she get murdered here? -the body was chopped up completely.
1595	1600	It's a 28 year old building. The whole thing is tilted.
1601	1604	We saw her blood flowing through a gap in the door.
1605	1608	The other mystery was...
1610	1615	The police tried to recompose her body together.
1615	1619	An extra 3 fingers and an ear came up.
1619	1622	An extra tonque as well.
1630	1632	Isn't it a terrible world?
1658	1661	Meal time, Gang.
1667	1668	Bye.
1721	1723	Hi, this is Shigehiko.
1724	1727	I'm going to stay at my friend's house tonight.
1727	1731	It's none of my business, but eat properly.
1731	1734	There's some Yoghurt there, please have it.
1736	1741	And Gang was hiding. Underneath the house, please feed him.
1741	1743	Talk to you later.
1832	1833	I'm sorry.
1834	1836	How have you been?
1839	1845	I never expected we would meet again. Sorry to be childish.
1848	1854	I never asked you about your family. Are they fine?
1865	1869	When I was little, my parents got a divorce.
1870	1873	I was sent to my uncle's house.
1875	1878	That was a terrible place.
1881	1885	I only remember being abused.
1886	1890	My uncle's wife was that sort of woman.
1892	1895	I have many scars.
1901	1904	If it's too painful, you needn't talk about.
1905	1910	No, I want you to know all about me.
1913	1918	I was forced into cold baths in winter, I got pneumonia.
1920	1925	She pushed me down the staircase. I broke my shoulder bone.
1929	1931	The doctor worried about me.
1932	1936	He sent me back to my mother's home.
1940	1942	When was that?
1943	1946	I was 7 years old.
1949	1950	Really.
1957	1961	My mother remarried for the 2nd time.
1963	1966	I've reduced the scars.
1969	1971	But my step father...
1972	1975	Hated me so much.
1977	1981	He's got disabled legs.
1982	1984	Staying at home all the time.
1987	1993	I did nothing in a dark room everyday.
1994	1999	Until my mother came home.
2001	2003	I'm sorry.
2004	2008	It's not a normal story is it?
2011	2016	If you dislike me please say so.
2017	2018	Strange.
2020	2025	I never imagined you'd had such an agonizing past.
2026	2030	Because ballet supported me. -You had talent.
2031	2032	I'm not sure.
2033	2039	But when I danced it purified the dark side of me.
2040	2046	That's the reason why I never tried to kill myself.
2055	2058	I think... you're wonderful.
2061	2065	I've been looking for someone like you.
2067	2068	Darling.
2076	2078	Ryoko.
2080	2084	This is an opportune time. Let me introduce you. This is Asami.
2095	2098	No... She isn't good for you.
2101	2102	No! She's a very fine woman.
2103	2107	No... darling no.
2112	2115	I want... I want you right now.
2141	2143	Asami.
2157	2160	That was a little mistake.
2160	2164	You made love to me. Only once.
2166	2169	I expected something from you.
2170	2172	Was I stupid?
2173	2174	Sorry.
2177	2178	Forgive me.
2178	2182	I'll do anything to give you pleasure.
2184	2187	I like doing this.
2188	2190	What are you doing! Stop it.
2197	2200	Look, you've got a hard on.
2200	2201	Stop it!
2320	2323	Extra 3 fingers, an ear...
2323	2326	...and a tongue too.
2357	2359	You only love me.
2359	2361	Only me.
2384	2385	Asami.
2389	2390	Asami.
2391	2393	Dance for me.
2396	2398	Dance.
2399	2400	Dance.
2401	2402	Dance bitch!
2403	2404	Dance...
2405	2407	...for me otherwise...
2409	2411	I'll torture you!
2411	2416	Dance. Please dance for me.
2416	2418	Please.
2418	2420	Dance!
2436	2438	Asami...
2439	2440	Good girl.
2455	2456	Asami!
2493	2494	This wire can...
2495	2498	...cut meat and bone very easily.
2517	2520	You are wonderful.
2523	2526	I never felt unhappy.
2527	2532	Because I'd been unhappy all the time.
2535	2536	Please stop!
2537	2539	No!
2540	2544	Males need female support.
2545	2547	Otherwise they can't maintain.
2547	2551	Let's have an audition.
2559	2564	My son told me that I look old. Why don't I remarry.
2566	2568	That's why I decided.
2621	2622	Asami...
2644	2645	You...
2665	2667	You can't move any more.
2668	2672	I've paralyzed your body but your nerves are still awake.
2677	2682	You can enjoy the pain. and suffer incredibly.
2773	2776	You guys collect many girls from auditions.
2777	2779	Make them fail.
2780	2783	You contact them later.
2783	2785	Just wanting to have sex.
2786	2789	Everybody is the same.
2847	2849	Deeper, deeper...
2854	2856	Deeper, deeper...
2857	2859	Painful?
2861	2866	Words create lies. Pain can be trusted.
2869	2870	Right?
2874	2879	You can feel pain. You can study about the human body as well.
2880	2881	Deeper...
2885	2887	This is the most painful point.
2890	2893	Am I right? Then here too.
2895	2897	Here as well.
2898	2899	Right?
2900	2902	Deeper, deeper...
2949	2951	Deeper, deeper...
2979	2981	Deeper, deeper...
2986	2990	Here we go. Underneath the eyes is also very painful.
2996	3001	You only realize what kind of man you are. When you feel pain...
3002	3007	...then you understand. When you have a very agonizing experience.
3015	3018	Your son called. Shigehiko, right?
3022	3027	Your son has to have pain, then you'll understand more.
3029	3030	Stop that!
3031	3035	Stay away from my son.
3036	3039	You love your son too?
3040	3043	You're a liar. You only love me, right?
3045	3050	I've only got you. You have so many others.
3054	3057	I don't want to be one of those.
3062	3067	Even if I give you all of me you won't be mine completely.
3069	3071	Everybody is the same.
3072	3074	Everybody.
3075	3076	Everybody.
3090	3093	You can't go anywhere without feet.
3101	3106	This wire can cut meat and bone easily.
3112	3113	Stop it!
3206	3208	Right foot please.
3223	3225	I'm home.
3225	3227	Dad, are you awake?
3236	3242	My friend got sick all of a sudden. So we called an ambulance.
3253	3254	Are you there?
3266	3268	What happened dad?
3350	3352	What's going on?
3363	3365	What happened?
3366	3367	Are you OK?
3387	3388	Well I will...
3389	3392	I'll answer your proposal.
3394	3395	What?
3399	3402	Your proposal...
3404	3406	I accept.
3411	3412	Proposal?
3421	3423	It's like a dream.
3425	3428	I'm so happy.
3433	3435	I applied for the audition.
3437	3439	I was the...
3442	3444	Luckiest one.
3446	3450	Because I didn't become the heroine of the movie.
3451	3453	But I became the real heroine.
3479	3480	Deeper, deeper...
3482	3484	What's wrong dad?
3489	3490	Who the hell are you?
3496	3498	What the hell do you want?
3562	3563	Dad!
3564	3566	Are you alright dad?
3567	3568	Daddy!
3571	3573	Call the police...
3573	3575	Police...
3582	3586	Is that the police? This is the Aoyama residence, Okusawa.
3587	3589	Please send an ambulance.
3590	3592	My fathers been seriously injured. And one woman too.
3593	3595	I don't know the details.
3596	3601	His left leg has been chopped off and is bleeding badly.
3605	3609	The address is Okusawa 6-20-4.
3611	3613	I thought you were very busy.
3615	3618	I don't know your job so well.
3619	3624	I might sound heavy.
3626	3630	But I've been waiting for your call for a long time.
3644	3648	I never expected that we would meet again.
3649	3652	Sorry to have been childish.
3654	3658	It's a hassle living alone.
3659	3662	I didn't have anybody to talk with.
3665	3668	You are the first one to support me.
3668	3671	Warmly wrapping me.
3671	3674	And trying to understand me.
3674	3678	It's hard to forget about.
3684	3686	But someday you'll feel...
3687	3691	...that life is wonderful.
3692	3696	That's life isn't it?
