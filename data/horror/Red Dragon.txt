119	122	''Think to yourself that every day is your last...
122	124	''the hour to which you do not look forward...
124	126	''will come as a welcome surprise.
127	128	''As for me...
128	129	''when you want a good laugh...
129	132	''you will find me, in a fine state...
132	134	''fat and sleek...
135	137	''a true hog of Epicurus' herd.''
139	143	And we find you cribbing lines from Horace, as well.
144	145	Well done, John.
145	147	l must say, Hannibal...
147	149	speaking for the rest of the herd...
150	152	l'm sorry, for the Symphony Board...
153	155	that these little soirees of yours...
155	157	are always the highlight of our year.
157	160	-Just so. -You're too kind.
160	165	l do feel guilty enjoying tonight when a musician is...
165	167	still listed as a missing person.
167	168	Yes, poor fellow.
169	171	Shall l confess something wicked?
171	176	l can't help feeling the tiniest bit...relieved.
178	179	lt sounds awful, l know.
179	182	But, let's face it, so does the man's playing.
183	185	Hannibal, confess.
185	188	What is this divine-looking amuse-bouche?
189	190	lf l tell you...
192	194	l'm afraid you won't even try it.
198	200	-Bon appétit. -Bon appétit.
216	219	Special Agent Graham. What an unexpected pleasure.
219	222	l'm sorry to bother you again, Dr. Lecter. l know it's late.
223	226	lt's no bother. We're both night owls, l think.
226	228	-Come in, please. -Thank you.
228	230	Let me take your coat.
231	232	What's on your mind?
232	236	We've been on the wrong track this whole time. You and l.
236	238	Our whole profile's wrong.
238	241	We've been looking for someone with a crazy grudge...
241	243	and some kind of anatomical knowledge.
243	246	Decertified doctors, med school dropouts...
246	247	laid-off mortuary workers--
247	251	From the precision of the cuts, and his choice of souvenirs.
251	253	That's where we're off-target.
253	255	He's not collecting body parts.
255	259	-Then why keep them? -He's not. He's eating them.
261	263	No, listen. We were at Molly's parents' for New Year's...
263	265	and her dad was showing my son, Josh...
265	267	how to carve a roasted chicken.
267	270	He said, ''The tenderest part of the chicken is the oysters...
270	272	''on either side of the back.''
273	276	l had never heard that expression before, ''oysters.''
277	280	Then suddenly l had a flash of the third victim...
280	282	Darcy Taylor.
282	285	She was missing flesh from her back. And then it hit me.
285	288	Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.
288	292	Every single victim lost some body part used in cooking.
293	295	Have you shared this with the Bureau?
295	299	No, l needed to see you first. But l'm right. l know l'm right.
299	301	l'm starting to be able to think like this one.
301	303	Yeah, it's fascinating.
304	307	You know, l'd always suspected as much. You are an eidetiker.
308	310	l'm not psychic, Doctor.
310	312	No, this is different.
312	314	More akin to artistic imagination.
315	318	You can assume the emotional point of view of others...
318	320	even those that might scare or sicken you.
320	323	lt's a troubling gift, l should think.
323	325	How l'd love to get you on my couch.
326	329	Something still doesn't make sense to me.
329	332	You're the best forensic psychiatrist l know...
333	334	and somehow, in all our time together...
335	336	this possibility never occurred to you.
337	341	l am only human, Will. Perhaps l made a mistake.
341	344	You don't strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes.
345	346	Now l'm sorry to think l might...
346	348	no longer enjoy your full confidence.
349	352	No, l didn't say that.
353	356	l don't know what l'm saying.
356	358	l'm very, very tired.
361	363	l almost had it.
364	366	lt'll come to you.
366	368	Why don't you come back in the morning?
368	370	l'll clear some time on my schedule and...
370	373	then we can get started in revising our profile.
373	375	-Sound good? -Yeah.
375	377	Rest here, and l'll get your coat.
378	380	Won't be a tick.
438	440	Don't move.
440	443	You're in shock now. l don't want you to feel any pain.
444	448	ln a moment you'll begin to be light-headed. Then drowsy.
448	452	Don't resist. lt's so gentle. Like slipping into a warm bath.
455	457	l regret it came to this, Will.
457	459	But every game must have its ending.
465	467	Remarkable boy.
467	469	l do admire your courage.
471	473	l think l'll eat your heart.
647	651	Marathon, Fl Several Years Later
667	669	Hey, Dad. Someone's here.
674	675	Hey.
677	679	You've got a beautiful setup here, Will.
679	680	Yeah, it's good.
681	685	-You know why l'm here? -Yeah, l can guess.
686	688	How much do you know?
688	691	Just what was in the Miami Herald and the Times.
691	694	Two families killed a month apart in their homes.
695	698	Birmingham and Atlanta. The circumstances were similar.
699	701	Not similar. The same.
702	704	What have you kept out of the papers?
704	707	He smashes mirrors and uses the pieces.
707	710	Wears latex gloves, so we've got no prints. Size 1 1 shoe.
712	714	He's not too comfortable with locks.
714	716	Pried open a patio door in Birmingham...
716	718	used a glass cutter in Atlanta.
719	721	And his blood's AB positive.
721	723	-Somebody hurt him? -Nope.
724	728	We typed him from semen and saliva. He's a secretor.
732	735	Tell me something, Will. You knew what this was.
736	739	Did you ever consider picking up the phone and giving me a call?
739	740	You've got all the people you need.
740	744	You've got Dortmund at Harvard. You got Bloom in Chicago.
744	746	l've got you down here fixing boat motors?
746	749	Yeah, l like fixing boat motors.
750	752	l wouldn't be very useful to you.
752	753	l don't think about it anymore.
753	756	Really? The last two we had, you caught.
756	758	By doing what you and the other guys are doing.
758	761	That's not entirely true. lt's the way you think.
761	764	Come on. There's been a lot of bullshit about the way l think.
764	767	l've got technicians to examine evidence...
767	768	but you've got that other thing.
768	771	lmagination. Projection. Whatever.
771	775	-l know you don't like it. -You wouldn't like it, either.
796	798	This freak killed the Jacobis in Birmingham...
799	801	on Saturday night, February 25. Full moon.
801	803	He killed the Leeds family in Atlanta...
803	804	a few nights ago, March 28.
804	806	One day short of a lunar month.
806	809	lf we're lucky, we may have a little over three weeks...
809	810	before he does it again.
811	813	Will, do you respect my judgment?
815	816	Of course.
816	819	l think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help.
819	822	Go to Atlanta and look. Just look.
823	825	Then help me brief the locals. That's it.
826	828	Crawford has the whole damn government.
828	829	Why does he need you?
829	832	He just wants me to look at some evidence, Molly.
832	834	Give him another point of view.
835	838	lt's a few days, a week maybe, and l'll be right back.
838	840	-And you believed that? -Yes.
842	844	These kinds of cases come up very rarely...
844	846	and l've had experience.
846	847	Yes, you have.
849	851	You're paid up, Will.
851	854	All of us. Even Josh.
855	859	There's a chance l could help them save some lives.
859	861	How do l say no to that?
869	872	This one will never see me or know my name.
874	876	l'll just help them find him.
876	878	The cops will take him down, not me.
883	886	l'll be in the back of the pack, Molly, l promise.
886	888	Never in your life.
891	894	-l know you. -Come on. Come here.
899	900	l love you.
901	902	-See you in a few days. -Okay.
903	905	l'll call you tonight.
915	917	Bye, Dad!
928	931	Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga
950	953	Where's the dog? No one heard barking.
953	956	There's nothing about it in the case file.
1079	1083	The intruder enters in the dark and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.
1083	1086	He shoots Valerie Leeds in the stomach as she's rising...
1086	1089	disabling her but not killing her.
1090	1092	He leaves her to watch her husband die...
1093	1095	then turns and goes down the hall.
1119	1121	The children were....
1125	1127	The children were still in bed when they were shot...
1127	1130	which might indicate that he used a silencer.
1138	1142	He dragged the bodies into the master bedroom, but why?
1142	1146	They were already dead and none of them got the same...
1147	1149	extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.
1178	1180	Small pieces of mirror were inserted...
1180	1183	in the orbital sockets of the victims.
1183	1185	This occurred post-mortem.
1195	1197	Why did you put mirrors in their eyes?
1266	1270	The pieces of mirror are to make their eyes look alive!
1270	1273	He wanted an audience. He wanted them all lined up...
1273	1276	watching him when he touched her.
1278	1279	When he touched her.
1283	1286	Touched. Talcum powder.
1286	1288	There was talcum powder.
1292	1294	''Mrs. Leeds had traces of talcum on her right inner thigh.
1295	1296	''A complete search of the home...
1296	1298	''led to no such matching talcum in the house.''
1301	1304	You took your gloves off, didn't you? You son of a bitch!
1305	1307	You took your gloves off, touched her...
1307	1308	with your bare hand and wiped her down.
1308	1311	But when the gloves were off, did you open her eyes?
1319	1320	Crawford.
1320	1322	Are the Leeds' bodies still at the morgue?
1323	1325	Who's good with latent prints here?
1325	1326	Atlanta P.D.
1326	1328	They've already printed the bodies.
1328	1330	Not the bodies. Tell them to check the eyes.
1330	1333	Mrs. Leeds' eyes. Even her corneas.
1333	1337	l think he took his gloves off. l think he had to touch her.
1338	1339	Jesus, Will.
1341	1342	Gentlemen. Ladies.
1342	1345	This is what the subject's teeth look like.
1345	1348	The impressions came from bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.
1349	1351	This degree of crookedness...
1351	1354	plus the groove in this central incisor...
1354	1356	makes his bite signature unique.
1356	1358	Fuckin' shark.
1359	1360	Knock it off!
1361	1363	We're grateful to have the FBl.
1363	1365	They have a lot of expertise in this area.
1365	1367	ln particular, lnvestigator Graham does.
1367	1368	That right, Jack?
1369	1370	Yes, sir.
1370	1373	Anything you want to add, Mr. Graham?
1373	1376	Why don't you come on up to the front, please?
1378	1379	-That's the guy. -Was he?
1379	1382	Yeah, that's the guy who arrested Lecter.
1382	1383	l thought he retired.
1383	1386	The son of a bitch just about gutted him.
1391	1395	Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi were the primary targets.
1395	1398	The others were killed just to complete his fantasy.
1398	1401	l know that might be hard to accept given what you saw...
1401	1403	but this was not random.
1403	1407	This wasn't some killing frenzy. He was never out of control.
1408	1411	These attacks were organized, the women carefully chosen.
1411	1414	We don't know how he's choosing them, or why.
1414	1416	They lived in different states and never met.
1417	1418	But there is some connection.
1418	1422	There's some common factor, and that's the key.
1422	1425	Find out what that is, and we'll save lives.
1425	1428	'Cause this one is gonna go on and on...
1428	1431	until we get smart or we get lucky.
1432	1434	He won't stop.
1435	1438	-Why not? -Because it makes him God.
1439	1441	Would you give that up?
1443	1446	You asked about the dog. Last night a vet called us.
1446	1449	Leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in...
1449	1451	the afternoon before they were killed.
1451	1453	Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.
1453	1455	The vet had to put it down.
1455	1457	Was it wearing a collar with the address on it?
1457	1458	No.
1460	1462	-Did the Jacobis have a dog? -No dog.
1462	1464	They found a litter box in the basement...
1464	1467	cat droppings in it, no cat.
1469	1472	lf the cat was attacked, the Jacobis may have buried it.
1473	1476	Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.
1476	1478	And tell them to use a methane probe, it's faster.
1481	1485	Yeah. lt's for you.
1487	1488	Crawford.
1492	1494	Carl, you're the light of my life.
1494	1496	Would it hold up in court?
1496	1498	Okay. Great work.
1499	1503	They found a print on Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.
1504	1507	Besides that, there's nothing else to tell you.
1507	1508	Thank you for your time.
1508	1510	l can't answer more questions.
1510	1512	Will Graham! Remember me?
1512	1516	Freddy Lounds. l covered the Lecter case for the Tattler.
1516	1518	-Did the paperback. -Yeah, l remember.
1518	1521	When did they bring you in? What've you got?
1521	1524	You think the Tooth Fairy will be bigger than Lecter?
1524	1527	l mean, he's already beaten Lecter's score--
1527	1530	You write lying shit, and the Tattler is an asswipe!
1530	1532	You stay away from me.
1532	1534	Get away, Lounds.
1535	1537	How about an exclusive?
1540	1541	Sorry about that.
1541	1544	That guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me.
1545	1547	Remember? With the tubes hanging out of me?
1547	1548	Forget that prick.
1548	1550	Give yourself some credit.
1550	1552	When we catch the Tooth Fairy...
1552	1554	that print plus his teeth will burn him.
1555	1556	You did that, Will.
1556	1558	That evidence was there, Jack.
1559	1562	-lt was there for anyone to see. -But nobody else did.
1562	1565	All l'm sayin' is, that was very good work.
1565	1567	No, good work would be seeing it all the way through...
1567	1569	and catching the guy.
1569	1572	And l can't do that. l did what you asked me to do.
1573	1574	l'm going home.
1576	1578	l don't even have any idea who this guy is.
1578	1582	What l just gave them was broad strokes. He's got no face to me.
1582	1584	That's what you said about Garrett Hobbs, remember?
1585	1587	-And you figured him out. -No, l didn't.
1587	1590	-You didn't? -No, l was stuck on Hobbs.
1592	1593	l had help.
1597	1599	From Lecter.
1601	1602	Yeah.
1607	1610	Jack, don't play games with me. Don't do it.
1611	1613	Just tell me what's on your mind.
1613	1616	l'm saying maybe we've got a resource we should look into.
1616	1618	ls that what this was about?
1618	1620	Did you just want to ask me that all along?
1620	1622	Don't get mad at me. l'm just doing my job.
1622	1624	lf you know a better shortcut, let me know it.
1624	1627	lf you think there's any chance he'll talk to me...
1627	1628	l'll go myself.
1630	1634	lf you can't handle it, God knows l'd understand that.
1641	1645	As a research subject, Lecter has proven most disappointing.
1645	1648	He's simply impenetrable to psychological testing.
1649	1651	Rorschach, Thematic Apperception.
1652	1653	He folds them into origami.
1655	1656	As you see.
1657	1659	So you can imagine the stir your little visit...
1659	1661	is causing among my staff, Mr. Graham.
1663	1665	lf you'd care to share some insights--
1665	1668	Dr. Chilton, l'm sorry, l've got a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.
1668	1670	Of course.
1673	1675	Tell me, when you saw Lecter's murders...
1675	1677	their style, so to speak...
1677	1680	were you able, perhaps, to reconstruct his fantasies?
1680	1683	And, if so, did you jot down any impressions?
1683	1684	No.
1692	1693	Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.
1694	1698	The first analysis of Lecter will be a publisher's wet dream.
1698	1700	l'd give you full credit, of course.
1704	1707	Damn it, man. You must have some advice. You caught him.
1707	1709	What was your trick?
1710	1712	l let him kill me.
1763	1767	That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court.
1769	1770	l keep getting it for Christmas.
1770	1774	Christmas, yes. Did you get my card?
1776	1777	l got it, thank you.
1777	1780	So nice of the Bureau's crime lab to forward that.
1781	1784	They wouldn't give me your home address.
1785	1788	Dr. Bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction...
1788	1790	in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.
1790	1791	And?
1792	1795	Very interesting, even to a layman.
1800	1802	You say you're a layman.
1809	1812	But it was you who caught me. Wasn't it, Will?
1814	1817	-Do you know how you did it? -l got lucky.
1818	1821	l don't think you believe that.
1822	1824	lt's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
1824	1826	lt doesn't matter to me, Will.
1826	1829	l need your advice, Dr. Lecter.
1831	1833	Birmingham and Atlanta.
1834	1837	You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
1837	1840	l thought you'd have ideas. l want you to tell me them.
1840	1841	Why should l?
1841	1842	There are things you don't have.
1843	1845	Research materials. Maybe even computer access.
1845	1847	l'd speak to the Chief of Staff.
1847	1849	Yes, Dr. Chilton.
1850	1852	Gruesome, isn't he?
1852	1856	He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at panties.
1857	1859	lf you recall, Will...
1859	1861	our last collaboration ended rather messily.
1864	1866	You'd get to see the file on this case.
1866	1870	-And there's another reason. -l'm all ears.
1871	1873	l thought you might enjoy the challenge.
1873	1876	Find out if you're smarter than the person l'm looking for.
1883	1886	Then, by implication, you think you're smarter than l am...
1886	1888	since it was you who caught me.
1889	1890	l know l'm not smarter than you.
1890	1892	Then how did you catch me?
1892	1895	You had disadvantages.
1895	1897	What disadvantages?
1897	1899	You're insane.
1904	1906	You're very tanned, Will.
1906	1910	And your hands are so rough. Not like a cop's hands anymore.
1910	1913	And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
1913	1916	Has a little ship on the bottle, does it not?
1916	1919	And how is young Josh and the lovely Molly?
1920	1922	They're always in my thoughts, you know.
1923	1924	You will not persuade me with appeals...
1924	1926	to my intellectual vanity.
1926	1928	l don't think l'll persuade you at all.
1928	1930	You'll either do it or you won't.
1930	1932	-ls that the case file? -Yes.
1932	1933	With photos?
1933	1935	Let me keep them, and l might consider it.
1936	1936	No.
1940	1942	Do you dream much, Will?
1942	1943	Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.
1943	1946	You haven't threatened to take away my books yet!
1947	1948	Give me the file, then!
1950	1952	And l'll tell you what l think.
1955	1957	l'll need one hour. And privacy.
1964	1966	Just like old times, Will?
1995	1997	-This is a very shy boy, Will.
1997	1999	l'd love to meet him.
1999	2002	Have you considered that he is disfigured...
2002	2004	or that he may believe he is disfigured?
2004	2006	Yeah, the mirrors.
2006	2008	Notice he smashes all the mirrors...
2008	2010	not just enough to get the pieces he wants.
2010	2012	And, of course, those shards in their eyes...
2012	2013	so he can see himself there.
2014	2015	That's interesting.
2015	2017	No, it's not. You thought of it before.
2017	2019	l had considered it.
2019	2021	-What about the women? -Dead?
2021	2023	Mere puppets.
2023	2026	You need to see them living, the way they caught his eye.
2027	2028	That's impossible.
2028	2029	Almost. Not quite.
2031	2033	What were the yards like?
2034	2038	Big backyards, fenced, some hedges. Why?
2038	2040	Because if this pilgrim...
2040	2042	feels a special relationship with the moon...
2042	2045	he might like to go outside and look at it.
2045	2047	You ever seen blood in the moonlight?
2047	2049	lt appears quite black.
2049	2052	lf one were nude, say, it'd be better to have...
2052	2054	outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.
2055	2058	You think the yards are a factor when he selects victims?
2058	2059	Yes.
2059	2062	And there will be more of them, of course. Victims.
2064	2066	You'll be wanting lots of these little chinwags...
2066	2068	-l take it. -l might not have time.
2068	2069	l do.
2069	2070	l have oodles.
2071	2073	l need your opinion now.
2073	2074	Then here's one:
2075	2078	You stink of fear under that cheap lotion.
2078	2081	You stink of fear, Will, but you're not a coward!
2083	2085	You fear me, but still you came here.
2085	2088	You fear this shy boy, yet still you seek him out.
2091	2093	Don't you understand, Will?
2093	2096	You caught me because we're very much alike.
2098	2099	Without our imaginations...
2099	2102	we'd be like all those other poor dullards.
2106	2109	Fear is the price of our instrument.
2110	2111	But l can help you bear it.
2123	2124	-You getting his face? -Yeah.
2124	2126	Okay, you got it?
2126	2128	All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
2129	2130	Sure you're okay?
2130	2131	Yeah, l'm okay.
2132	2134	What do you think he meant by ''see them living''?
2134	2137	l don't know, maybe nothing.
2137	2139	lt's hard to separate his bullshit.
2139	2142	But l'm gonna make another pass at the Leeds' house.
2192	2194	All right, Duchess, doll. That's it.
2194	2196	Show me what you can do.
2198	2202	Who's that? Get them, Duchess. Get them, Duch! Go get them!
2202	2204	Go get them, girl!
2204	2205	Okay.
2205	2206	And action!
2207	2208	Charles! What are you doing?
2209	2210	Hey, gang.
2210	2211	You crazy man.
2211	2213	How is everybody doing?
2213	2215	Just home from the store.
2215	2217	-Hi, Daddy. -That's my girl.
2217	2219	-Hi, Daddy. -Hi, honey. Billy?
2219	2220	Hi, Dad.
2220	2222	-And sweetie?
2222	2225	l am not ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.
2225	2227	What do you think?
2228	2231	Get closer. Get closer. Little closer.
2232	2234	l think we'd better put these kids to bed early tonight.
2235	2237	They seem tired. Don't you think?
2238	2240	Here we are at the pool party.
2240	2242	What are you doing? Stop it!
2242	2244	You stop it! l'm telling my mother on you.
2244	2246	Now l get my kiss?
2246	2250	-All right, you want a kiss? -l want one. The romantic kind.
2256	2258	Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al
2265	2269	Won't nobody get in through here again. l'll guaran-damn-tee it.
2272	2275	Why didn't he break in down there? lt's more hidden.
2275	2277	Hell, that door's got deadbolts.
2277	2279	Reckon he was in too big a hurry.
2280	2282	No, this one doesn't hurry.
2336	2338	You sat right here, didn't you?
2338	2341	You watched the children bury the cat.
2341	2343	And then you waited for dark.
2362	2365	You're proud. You had to sign your work.
2400	2403	Grandma? Grandma?
2404	2405	l'm sorry.
2405	2410	l've never seen a child as dirty and disgusting as you.
2410	2413	Look at you! You're soaking wet. Get out of my bed.
2413	2415	-No. -Go back to your room.
2415	2417	You're hurting me!
2417	2419	Shut up, you filthy little beast!
2419	2422	l should have put you in an orphanage, grandson or not.
2422	2426	Grandma, don't hurt me.
2426	2427	You're hurting me!
2427	2428	lnto the bathroom!
2429	2432	Take off your nightshirt, and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!
2433	2436	Now give me my scissors from the medicine chest.
2436	2437	Please, no!
2437	2440	Take that filthy thing in your hand. Stretch it out.
2440	2441	No, Grandma.
2441	2442	-Now! -Please!
2442	2445	Look down. Do you want me to cut it off? Do you?
2445	2446	No, Grandma!
2446	2448	l pledge you my word, Francis...
2448	2450	if you ever make your bed dirty again...
2450	2452	l'll cut it off. Do you understand?
2452	2456	l'll be a good boy. l promise.
2568	2570	Good morning, Will.
2570	2572	So nice of you to visit again.
2575	2577	He carved this on a tree near the Jacobi house.
2577	2579	With a Buck knife.
2579	2581	The same one later used on Charles Leeds.
2581	2582	Yes.
2585	2587	Take a walk with me.
2589	2592	He had a second tool, too. A bolt cutter.
2592	2594	He used that to clear his view.
2594	2595	But?
2595	2597	l don't think that's what he brought it for.
2598	2600	lt's too heavy. Too awkward.
2600	2602	And he had to carry it a long way.
2602	2604	And what do we make of that symbol?
2604	2606	Asian Studies at Langley...
2606	2608	identified it as a Chinese character.
2609	2611	lt appears on a mah-jong piece.
2611	2614	-lt marks the Red Dragon. -Red Dragon. Correct.
2614	2617	This boy begins to interest me.
2617	2620	We don't know what greater meaning the symbol might have--
2620	2623	Do you like my little exercise cage, Will?
2623	2625	My so-called lawyer is always nagging Dr. Chilton...
2626	2627	for better accommodations.
2627	2629	l don't know which is the greater fool.
2629	2631	Perhaps if you could offer some insight into--
2631	2635	''A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage''
2636	2639	Ever been a redbreast, Will? Of course you have.
2640	2642	l'm allowed 30 minutes in here, once a week.
2642	2644	Get to the point.
2645	2647	He meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house...
2647	2648	but he didn't.
2648	2651	lnstead he broke in through the patio doors.
2651	2654	The noise woke Jacobi, and he had to shoot him on the stairs.
2654	2656	That wasn't planned. lt was sloppy.
2656	2658	And that's not like him.
2659	2661	We mustn't judge too harshly, Will.
2661	2662	lt was his first time.
2663	2666	Have you never felt a sudden rush of panic?
2672	2674	Yeah, that's the fear we talked about.
2674	2677	lt takes experience to master it.
2677	2679	You sensed who l was...
2679	2681	back when l was committing what you call my ''crimes.''
2681	2682	Yes.
2682	2684	So you were hurt not by a fault in your perception...
2685	2686	or your instincts...
2686	2689	but because you failed to act on them until it was too late.
2690	2693	-You could say that. -But you're wiser now.
2693	2697	lmagine what you would do, Will, if you could go back in time.
2697	2701	Put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto.
2701	2703	Very good, Will.
2703	2706	You know, l believe we're making progress.
2706	2708	And that's what our pilgrim is doing.
2708	2710	He is refining his methods.
2710	2711	He is evolving.
2715	2718	The case file mentioned videos of the Leeds family.
2718	2720	-l'd like to see those. -No.
2720	2722	-Why not? -lt would be obscene.
2722	2726	You don't make it easy, do you? Still, one aims to please.
2727	2729	l'll call you if l think of anything else.
2729	2731	Would you perhaps like to leave me your home number?
2735	2738	-That's the end of our session. -For now.
2739	2741	lt was only his first time.
2741	2744	Already in Atlanta he did much better.
2744	2746	Rest assured, my dear Will...
2746	2748	this one will give you plenty of exercise.
2752	2755	My love to Molly and Josh, goodbye.
2755	2758	Go to the back of the cell, Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.
2761	2763	lf you turn around before the lock snaps...
2764	2765	you'll get a dart.
2765	2766	- Understood? -Yes.
2767	2769	You got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer.
2776	2779	-Starting now. -Thanks so much, Barney.
2784	2786	Hello, Dr. Lecter?
2786	2789	l have those documents you requested me--
2796	2799	''Robes, Robespierre, Robin.
2799	2802	''Robin, call for.... Robin, fainting....
2803	2807	''Redbreast in a cage.'' 406.9.
2812	2814	''A robin redbreast in a cage Puts all heaven in a rage''
2814	2815	Yes, that's it.
2816	2818	William Blake. Auguries of lnnocence.
2818	2819	Think you got it?
2819	2820	Yeah, we should have.
2820	2823	We have some books of Blake's paintings, too.
2823	2825	-Want to see them? -Yeah. Thanks.
2826	2827	Psychology Department...
2827	2829	University of Chicago. Dr. Bloom's office.
2829	2832	Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine and Edwards Publishing.
2832	2835	Dr. Bloom asked me to send The Psychiatrist and the Law...
2835	2836	to Will Graham.
2836	2839	His assistant was supposed to give me...
2839	2842	the address and phone number, but, darn it, she never did.
2842	2844	l'm just a temp. Linda will be in on Monday.
2844	2847	l have to catch FedEx in about five minutes.
2847	2849	l hate to bother Dr. Bloom about it...
2849	2850	because he told Linda to send it...
2851	2853	and l don't want to get her into trouble.
2853	2855	lt's right there in the Rolodex, or whatever.
2855	2858	l'll dance at your wedding if you read it to me.
2858	2861	l don't know. l'm really not supposed to.
2861	2863	Be a darling and flip that old rascal...
2863	2865	l won't take up any more of your time.
2865	2867	Graham, Will.
2868	2870	All right. Just a minute.
2872	2874	''Gibson, Gordon, Graham. ''
2875	2876	lt doesn't give a home address.
2876	2877	What does it have, dear?
2877	2882	''FBl, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, D.C. ''
2882	2884	-Yeah? -And let's see.
2885	2886	Here it is.
2886	2890	''P.O. Box 3680, Marathon, Florida. ''
2890	2892	-Marathon. -Yes.
2892	2895	That's fine. You're an angel.
2947	2949	l'm Francis Dolarhyde.
2949	2952	l've come for the package of infrared.
2952	2955	Right. Put your back against the door and come...
2955	2958	forward three steps till you feel tile under your feet.
2958	2960	And there's a stool just on the left.
2962	2966	Same Mr. D who's head of Tech Services, am l right?
2967	2968	l'm Reba McClane.
2969	2972	Just a second more and l will get you some light.
2975	2977	Okay, here we go.
2981	2984	So, what do you need the lR for?
2985	2986	lt's for the zoo.
2987	2989	They want to photograph the nocturnal animals.
2989	2994	That's great. l love animals. l got to warn you, though.
2994	2998	This stuff is pretty sensitive. lt can be mean to handle.
3001	3004	But l guess l don't need to tell you that.
3011	3015	Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!
3015	3018	l'm not interrupting anything, am l?
3018	3019	No, Ralph.
3019	3021	lt's starting to spritz outside.
3021	3022	l'll give you a lift home?
3023	3024	You ride a motorcycle.
3024	3026	How's that gonna help me with the rain?
3026	3029	l thought maybe we'd stop off someplace...
3029	3031	have ourselves a little sundowner.
3031	3034	-l've already got a ride. -lt's cool.
3034	3037	That's cool. No problemo.
3046	3050	lf there's anything l hate worse than pity, it's fake pity.
3050	3053	Especially from a walking hard-on like Ralph Mandy.
3054	3057	-Sorry. -l have no pity.
3090	3092	Ride with me!
3093	3095	Thanks, but l take the bus all the time.
3097	3100	Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...
3103	3104	for my pleasure.
3118	3120	You want to come in? l'll fix us a drink.
3126	3130	-Maybe another time. -l will come in.
3138	3140	When is the zoo project?
3140	3144	-Maybe next week. They'll call. -l love zoos.
3146	3150	ln fact one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar...
3150	3152	when l was about five.
3152	3155	l didn't lose my sight till l was seven. Diphtheria.
3155	3158	Could you hand me that knife?
3174	3178	l've always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like.
3179	3183	But by now, to tell the truth, what l see in my head...
3183	3185	is probably not in the least bit like a cougar.
3185	3187	lt's more like a donkey or a goat.
3187	3190	You know, sometimes l'm not so sure l really saw him.
3190	3193	Maybe he's just something l dreamed up.
3196	3197	You okay?
3199	3201	You don't say much, do you?
3202	3203	No, l guess not.
3206	3211	Let's talk about something and get it out of the way, okay?
3220	3222	l can hear that you've had...
3223	3226	some kind of soft palate repair.
3227	3230	But l understand you fine because you speak very well.
3231	3234	lf you don't want to talk to me, that's cool.
3235	3238	But l hope that you will, because...
3239	3241	l know what it's like to have people...
3241	3244	always thinking that you're different.
3247	3248	That's good.
3251	3253	May l touch your face?
3254	3257	l want to know if you're smiling or frowning.
3257	3261	l want to know whether l should just shut up or not.
3271	3273	Take my word that l'm smiling.
3277	3278	l have to go.
3278	3281	lf l offended you, l didn't mean to.
3281	3282	No.
3289	3291	F.B.l. Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
3291	3293	l don't know what they were like.
3293	3295	lt'd help if l could see some of their personal effects.
3295	3298	Diaries, letters. Do you have those things?
3298	3300	l sure do. l mean, other than...
3300	3303	one or two little keepsakes Niles Jacobi got.
3304	3307	That would be Mr. Jacobi's surviving son by his first wife?
3307	3311	Yes. As their executor, l keep all that stuff in the office...
3311	3314	along with some of the smaller valuables, till after probate.
3315	3317	But the Birmingham P.D.'s been all through it.
3317	3320	Could you pack those things and ship them up to me?
3324	3327	l hate to ask. l know it's a pain in the ass.
3329	3330	Hell...
3331	3334	probate judge is an old golfing buddy of mine.
3335	3340	Son, just tell me you're gonna nail that son of a bitch.
3340	3341	We're doing our best.
3342	3344	Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.
3345	3347	A note hidden in Lecter's cell. Sounds like a fan letter.
3348	3349	Might've been mailed by the Tooth Fairy.
3349	3351	He wants Lecter's approval.
3351	3353	He's curious about you. He's asking questions.
3353	3355	l've scrambled a chopper.
3355	3356	Does Lecter know we have the note?
3356	3358	Not yet. lt was found in a routine cleanup.
3359	3360	They don't open his mail?
3360	3362	Need a warrant. X-rays only.
3362	3364	-Where's Lecter? -The holding cage.
3364	3365	Can he see his cell?
3365	3368	No. But he's been there almost half an hour.
3368	3369	He'll soon start to wonder what's wrong.
3369	3371	We got to buy time, Jack.
3374	3376	-Dr. Chilton. -Yes?
3376	3377	Call your building superintendent...
3378	3379	or engineer, whoever's in charge.
3379	3382	Tell him to pull the circuit breakers on Lecter's hall.
3382	3385	Have the super walk down the hall past the cell...
3385	3386	carrying tools.
3386	3390	He'll be in a hurry, pissed off, too busy to answer questions.
3390	3393	And don't forget: Don't touch the note, okay?
3394	3396	Graham's on his way.
3396	3399	Listen up! We've got a note coming in on the fly...
3399	3403	possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number One Priority.
3404	3406	lt has to go back to Lecter's cell within the hour...
3406	3408	unmarked.
3408	3412	We'll need Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints, then Documents.
3413	3416	l'll walk it through myself. Let's go, people!
3419	3422	My dear Dr. Lecter.: l wanted to tell you...
3422	3423	l'm delighted...
3423	3425	that you've taken an interest in me.
3425	3429	And when l learned ofyour vast correspondence, l thought.:
3430	3432	''Dare l?'' Of course l do.
3434	3437	l don't believe you'll tell them who l am.
3437	3440	Besides, what particular body l currently occupy is trivial.
3440	3443	The important thing is what l am becoming.
3444	3447	l know that you alone can understand this transformation.
3448	3451	l have some things l'd love to show you.
3451	3454	lf circumstances permit, l hope we can correspond.
3455	3457	l have admired you for years and have...
3457	3459	a complete collection of your press notices.
3460	3462	Actually, l think of them as unfair reviews.
3463	3465	As unfair as mine.
3466	3469	They do like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?
3469	3473	''The Tooth Fairy. '' What could be more inappropriate?
3473	3476	lt would shame me for you to read that, if l didn't know...
3476	3479	you had suffered the same distortions in the press.
3479	3481	l'm fed up with this bloody stupid building!
3482	3483	Every day something breaking.
3483	3486	l swear they ought to tear the whole fucking place down.
3486	3489	-How much longer do we have? -Ten minutes, max.
3489	3490	lnstructions for answering...
3490	3492	were probably in the section Lecter tore out.
3492	3495	Why not just throw the whole note away?
3495	3496	lt was full of compliments.
3496	3499	He couldn't bear to part with them.
3502	3504	Now we can mash just a little.
3506	3507	You're so sly.
3509	3511	But so am l.
3512	3515	Aniline dyes and colored inks are transparent to infrared.
3515	3518	These could be the tips of ''T's'' here and here.
3518	3521	On the end, that's a ''P, '' or possibly an ''R. ''
3521	3524	Maybe this is where he's telling Lecter how to answer him.
3524	3526	There's only one way to carry on a conversation...
3526	3527	that's one-way blind.
3527	3529	Publication. Wait a minute.
3529	3531	We know this guy reads the Tattler.
3531	3532	That's in his note, right?
3532	3534	The Tooth Fairy, they made that up.
3535	3537	Three ''T's'' and an ''R'' in ''Tattler.''
3537	3539	How do you communicate through a tabloid?
3539	3542	-You got what? News stories. -Personals.
3542	3545	Maybe he wants Lecter to answer him through the personals?
3545	3547	-That could be it. -We need proofs of the pages...
3548	3549	before the next Tattler's published!
3549	3550	l'm on it!
3550	3552	lnvestigator Graham interests me.
3553	3555	Not your standard gumshoe, is he?
3555	3556	More alert.
3556	3558	Purposeful looking.
3558	3561	You should have taught him not to meddle.
3561	3563	Forgive the stationery.
3563	3566	l chose it because it'll dissolve very quickly...
3566	3568	ifyou should have to swallow it.
3568	3572	lf l hear from you, next time l might send you something wet.
3574	3576	Until then, dear Doctor...
3577	3578	l remain your most...
3579	3580	avid fan.
3600	3602	The Tattler got an ad order signed 666...
3602	3604	Baltimore postmark on the envelope.
3604	3606	lt's set to run this afternoon.
3606	3609	Chicago field office is sending the text through now.
3612	3614	-''Dear Pilgrim.'' -That's it.
3614	3616	Lecter called him a pilgrim when we talked.
3616	3620	''You honor me. You're very beautiful.'' Christ!
3620	3622	''l offer 100 prayers for your safety.
3622	3625	''Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...
3625	3627	''9:1, Luke 1 :7.''
3627	3628	-Code. -Has to be.
3631	3635	We've got 19 minutes to get in a message if we can break this.
3635	3637	The Tattler can't hold its presses any longer.
3637	3638	lt's simple.
3638	3641	They only needed cover against casual readers.
3641	3643	-l'm thinking it's a book code. -Code?
3643	3644	The first numeral...
3644	3645	''100 prayers,'' may be the page number.
3645	3648	The numbers after could be line and letter. But what book?
3648	3650	-Bible? -No, he's got ''Galatians 15:2.''
3651	3652	lt has only six chapters.
3652	3654	Same with ''Jonah 6:8.'' lt has four chapters.
3654	3656	He wasn't using a Bible.
3656	3658	Then the Tooth Fairy named the book to use.
3658	3661	He specified it in his note, in the part Lecter tore out.
3661	3663	lt would appear so.
3663	3666	What about sweating Lecter? ln a mental hospital...
3666	3667	-l would think drugs-- -No.
3668	3670	They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago, to find out...
3671	3672	where he buried the Princeton student.
3672	3674	He gave them a recipe for dip.
3674	3676	lf we sweat him, we lose the connection.
3676	3678	lf the Tooth Fairy picked the book...
3678	3681	he knew Lecter would have it in his cell.
3681	3684	-Can we get a list of his books? -From Chilton, maybe.
3684	3687	No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham, when they tossed his cell...
3687	3689	took Polaroids so they could put everything back in place.
3689	3692	Ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves!
3692	3694	-Where? -The Library!
3698	3700	l'm leery of letting Lecter's message run...
3700	3702	without knowing what it says.
3703	3706	l say let this one run. We keep working on the code.
3706	3708	At least it'll encourage the Fairy to contact him again.
3708	3711	What if it encourages him to do something besides write?
3711	3713	l don't like this any better than you.
3714	3716	But it's our best shot.
3718	3720	National Tattler Building, Chicago, ll
3736	3738	Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
3752	3753	Oh, my God!
3758	3759	Hello?
3759	3761	Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman. l solved the code.
3761	3763	You need to know what it says right now.
3763	3764	Okay, Lloyd.
3764	3768	lt says, ''Graham home, Marathon, Florida.
3768	3770	''Save yourself. Kill them all.''
3772	3774	-Yeah? -Bowman just broke the code.
3775	3777	-What does it say? -l'll tell you in a second.
3777	3779	Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.
3779	3782	l've taken care of it. Stay on the phone when l tell you.
3782	3783	Tell me now.
3783	3785	Lecter gave the bastard your home address.
3785	3786	Wait.
3813	3814	Mom?
3825	3827	Head down, ma'am.
3852	3854	ls he after you now?
3854	3856	No, Lecter just suggested it to him.
3858	3861	l hate this, Molly.
3861	3863	l'm sorry.
3865	3867	-lt's a sick feeling. -l know it is.
3867	3869	But you'll be safe here.
3869	3870	Crawford's brother owns this place.
3871	3873	No one in the world knows you're here.
3873	3875	l'd just as soon not talk about Crawford.
3876	3879	-What are you using as bait? -Sometimes l use worms.
3880	3881	You like those?
3895	3897	Beneath the yellow folder...
3897	3899	you'll find your latest rejection slip...
3899	3900	from the archives.
3900	3904	lt was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail.
3904	3907	l'm afraid l opened it without looking.
3907	3908	Sorry.
3913	3917	l think we'll remove Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.
3940	3941	Atlanta P.D. nailed him.
3942	3943	He had a fake Bureau lD...
3944	3946	and was trying to get the Leeds family autopsy photos.
3947	3951	lt's a Federal beef, so Atlanta kicked him back to us.
3951	3952	Personally...
3952	3955	l'd like nothing better than to see the dirt sandwich...
3955	3956	pulling five at Leavenworth.
3957	3959	But maybe there's a better way to handle this.
3959	3961	Yeah? What's that?
3961	3963	l think we ought to give him a story.
3963	3965	The Tooth Fairy's ugly...
3965	3968	and he's impotent with members of the opposite sex.
3969	3972	Also, he sexually molests his male victims.
3973	3974	While they're alive?
3974	3977	Sorry, l can't go into those details.
3977	3978	But we do also speculate...
3979	3981	that he's the product of an incestuous home.
3981	3984	No wonder the creep's such a loser, right?
3986	3988	That's a tip we got from Dr. Lecter, by the way.
3989	3992	So it's true that Lecter's helping with your investigation?
3992	3994	Yes, it's true.
3994	3997	The Doctor was offended a bottom-feeding lowlife like...
3997	4000	the Tooth Fairy would consider himself in the same league.
4004	4007	Okay, tell me about this place you got here.
4007	4009	Will, your little Washington hideaway.
4009	4011	This is an apartment l'm borrowing...
4011	4013	till this creep goes down in flames.
4014	4018	l keep copies of the evidence so l can work on it at night.
4018	4020	Make sure you can read the name on that building.
4020	4022	Yeah.
4024	4026	All right, l got enough.
4026	4029	Just remember, l scratch your back, you scratch mine.
4030	4033	lf my story draws the Fairy in an attack on Graham...
4033	4036	and you nail the scumbag, l get an exclusive.
4036	4038	Fuck you, Lounds.
4038	4041	When we see the story, we'll consider what to do...
4041	4043	about your sealed indictment.
4043	4048	All right, it was a pleasure doing business with you, chumps.
4056	4059	l feel like l need a shower.
4059	4061	You okay with this?
4061	4064	Better he comes after me than Molly and Josh.
4064	4066	So, yeah, l'm okay with it.
4066	4068	l wish we had something better...
4068	4070	but there's only ten days till the next full moon.
4070	4073	We've got to rattle his cage.
4073	4076	We'll stake out this apartment, put snipers on the rooftops.
4076	4079	You'll have a moving box tail, 24/7, in your car...
4079	4081	on the street, wherever you go.
4081	4084	You'll wear the Kevlar at all times. No exceptions.
4090	4091	You again?
4092	4094	Come back at 4:00 a.m. when l open, all right?
4100	4102	Hey, l told you!
4102	4103	What?
4104	4106	You told me what?
4127	4128	Fucking dickhead!
4129	4132	ls that your fucking name on the sign?
4186	4187	Where am l?
4190	4192	What am l doing here?
4193	4195	Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
4197	4199	l haven't seen your face.
4199	4201	l couldn't possibly identify you.
4201	4204	l work for the National Tattler.
4207	4209	lt would pay...
4211	4213	a big reward for me.
4215	4217	l mean, a half a million...
4217	4219	or a million, maybe.
4219	4221	Do you know who l am, Mr. Lounds?
4222	4223	No.
4223	4225	And l don't want to know.
4226	4227	You know, believe me.
4227	4231	According to you, l'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure...
4231	4233	a ''bottom-feeding lowlife''...
4233	4235	who's about to ''go down in flames.''
4237	4239	l think you know now, don't you?
4242	4243	Yes.
4245	4247	Do you understand what l'm doing, Mr. Lounds?
4248	4250	No.
4250	4252	But l would like to.
4252	4254	l really want to understand...
4255	4258	and then all my readers could understand, too.
4259	4260	l am not a man.
4260	4262	l began as one...
4262	4265	but each being that l change makes me...
4265	4266	more than a man...
4267	4268	as you will witness.
4268	4270	l don't need to see you. No.
4270	4273	But you must, Mr. Lounds.
4273	4274	You're a reporter.
4275	4276	You're here to report.
4285	4287	Open your eyes and look at me.
4287	4288	No.
4289	4290	lf you won't open them...
4290	4292	l'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
4293	4293	No!
4294	4296	Open your eyes!
4311	4312	Oh, my dear God Jesus!
4320	4321	Oh, God!
4335	4337	Do you want to know what l am?
4338	4340	More than anything.
4340	4342	l was afraid to ask.
4352	4354	Do you see now?
4354	4355	Yeah, l see.
4355	4356	Oh, God.
4357	4359	Mrs. Jacobi in human form.
4359	4361	-Do you see? -Yes.
4361	4363	Mrs. Leeds in human form.
4363	4365	-Do you see? -Yes.
4365	4367	-Mrs. Jacobi changing. -Oh, my God.
4368	4369	Mrs. Leeds changing.
4370	4371	Do you see?
4372	4374	Mrs. Jacobi reborn.
4374	4375	Do you see?
4376	4378	Mrs. Leeds reborn.
4378	4381	-Do you see? -Please, no.
4381	4382	No? No what?
4383	4384	Not me.
4387	4390	Why did you write lies, Mr. Lounds?
4392	4394	Graham told me to lie.
4396	4397	lt wasn't me.
4397	4399	-Will you tell the truth now? -Yes!
4399	4401	About me?
4401	4403	-My work? -Oh, yes.
4404	4405	My becoming?
4406	4407	Yeah.
4409	4413	l am the Dragon, and you call me insane!
4413	4416	You are privy to a great becoming...
4416	4418	and you recognize nothing.
4419	4421	You are an ant in the afterbirth.
4422	4425	lt is in your nature to do one thing correctly.
4425	4428	Before me, you rightly tremble.
4429	4432	But fear is not what you owe me, Mr. Lounds.
4439	4441	You owe me awe.
4454	4456	Read.
4459	4461	That's all, Mr. Lounds.
4461	4463	You did very well.
4463	4465	Will you let me go now?
4465	4467	Soon.
4467	4471	There's one more way l can help you to better understand.
4471	4473	l want to understand.
4473	4476	l do. And l'm really gonna be fair...
4477	4478	from now on.
4479	4481	You know that.
4487	4488	Hello?
4489	4491	Oh, God, no!
4519	4521	l have had a great privilege.
4521	4523	l have seen with...
4523	4528	wonder and awe the strength of the Great Red Dragon.
4528	4532	He has helped me to understand his splendor...
4532	4534	and now l want to serve him.
4536	4538	He knows you made me lie, Will Graham.
4539	4541	Because l was forced to lie...
4541	4544	he will be more merciful to me than to you.
4547	4549	Hello?
4549	4551	Oh, God, no!
4573	4576	We can let this tie us up in knots...
4576	4578	or we can learn from it.
4579	4581	Maybe even use it to catch the bastard.
4587	4589	He had to have a van or panel truck...
4590	4592	to move Lounds around in that big old wheelchair.
4593	4593	Go on.
4594	4595	He had to already have the wheelchair...
4595	4597	or know where to get one fast.
4597	4600	lt's an antique, not something you'd find in the house.
4600	4603	Does it strike anybody that he set this up in a hurry?
4603	4606	The Tattler comes off the press Monday night.
4606	4609	By Tuesday morning he's in Chicago, snatching Lounds.
4609	4611	He either lives in the Chicago area...
4611	4613	or he's within a driving radius of...
4614	4615	call it six hours.
4615	4618	Find out in this area where the Tattler was available...
4618	4620	for early distribution Monday night.
4620	4622	Start with airports, all-night newsstands.
4622	4624	Maybe a newsie remembers an odd customer.
4624	4626	Lloyd, this cassette, enhance the audio.
4626	4629	Maybe you can pick up something in the background.
4629	4630	That wheelchair...
4630	4632	l want the maker, date, possible sources.
4632	4636	Graham and l will coordinate from Chicago. Let's hustle.
4647	4651	Look, there's not gonna be any answers in Chicago, Jack.
4651	4654	Okay? l mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.
4655	4659	That was a chance to show off. lt doesn't even fit his pattern.
4660	4663	The Leeds and the Jacobis are what he needs.
4670	4672	l think l should go back to Baltimore.
4672	4673	After what he tried to pull?
4673	4677	Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of the note.
4677	4679	Not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.
4679	4681	Even if he did, he won't tell you.
4681	4683	Not unless l can offer him something.
4684	4685	Congratulations.
4686	4690	That was most artistic, the way you disposed of Mr. Lounds.
4691	4693	Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.
4693	4694	Does it?
4694	4695	l hadn't noticed.
4695	4697	Oh, you will.
4697	4699	l have other resources.
4700	4702	Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?
4703	4705	Your first murder?
4705	4708	Of course you did. Why shouldn't it feel good?
4708	4709	lt does to God.
4710	4713	Why, only last week in Texas, he dropped a church roof...
4713	4715	on the heads of 34 of his worshippers...
4715	4718	as they were groveling through a hymn.
4718	4720	He wouldn't begrudge you one journalist.
4721	4722	Put me next to him, Doctor.
4722	4724	You and some SWAT team?
4724	4726	Oh, Will. Where's the fun in that?
4727	4729	He'll have to take his chances, too.
4729	4731	A roof can fall on anybody.
4733	4735	But not on Molly and Josh, l take it.
4735	4737	Not yet, anyway.
4737	4740	First he kills the pet, then the family.
4741	4743	Freddy was your pet.
4743	4745	They're safe now.
4745	4747	No one will ever be safe around you, Will.
4757	4760	Clever work on his note, by the way.
4760	4763	And that blackout was an especially nice touch.
4764	4766	What else was in that note, Doctor?
4770	4772	Put me next to him!
4772	4774	That's what you want, isn't it?
4774	4776	To help him succeed where you failed?
4776	4777	Twice?
4778	4780	Give him a chance to kill me.
4781	4782	Go on, then.
4782	4784	Seduce me with your wares.
4785	4787	Full restoration of your privileges.
4787	4790	Plus computer access to the AMA archives.
4790	4792	One hour a week under supervision, of course...
4792	4794	but it's a one-time offer.
4794	4796	lt expires the minute l walk out of here.
4796	4798	Bit measly, don't you think?
4798	4802	Turn it down, then. See what terms you get from Chilton.
4802	4803	Are these threats, William?
4803	4807	l'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe you've got nothing left to sell.
4811	4814	A little sample, then. Why not?
4815	4817	-Seen the Blake, have you? -Yes.
4817	4819	No, you've looked but not seen.
4819	4821	Transformation is the key.
4821	4822	The man-dragon...
4822	4825	his ugliness transformed by power.
4825	4828	Look for a military record with combat training.
4828	4830	Look for extensive tattooing...
4830	4832	and corrective surgery, most likely to the face.
4833	4836	Come on, l'm past that already and you know it.
4836	4838	Give me what l need.
4838	4839	How is he choosing the women?
4839	4842	l've already suggested how. The answer was in front of you.
4842	4845	-You looked but didn't see. -Bullshit! No riddles!
4845	4847	Just tell me.
4847	4848	No!
4848	4849	lt's your turn.
4849	4851	l asked you before for a small courtesy...
4851	4853	and you responded rudely.
4854	4856	Before l tell you anything more...
4856	4859	you will make certain arrangements for me.
4859	4861	What kind of arrangements?
4861	4863	Oh, nothing much.
4864	4866	Shall we say dinner and a show?
4869	4872	You ready to tell me what kind of outing this is?
4873	4874	Nope.
4876	4879	You're just full of surprises, aren't you, D?
4879	4880	Yep.
4882	4884	He's about six feet away.
4884	4886	Can you smell him?
4886	4887	Yeah.
4887	4890	Now, he's a little noisy, but he's sedated, l assure you.
4891	4894	Doctor Hassler's about to fix his broken tooth.
4894	4895	Glad you could come, Ms. McClane.
4896	4898	We appreciate the infrared film, by the way.
4898	4900	Two more steps.
4900	4903	l'll put your left hand on the edge of the table.
4904	4906	Now, he's right in front of you.
4906	4908	Take your time.
4915	4917	-D? -l'm here.
4919	4921	You go ahead.
4964	4965	Here.
4967	4969	Why don't you try this?
5014	5016	Nine steps from the front door to the clock...
5016	5018	and three more to this room.
5019	5021	Sorry. Force of habit.
5027	5031	That beautiful tiger, this house, this music....
5031	5034	l don't think anybody knows you at all, D.
5034	5036	Everybody wonders about you, though.
5037	5038	Especially the women.
5039	5041	What do they want to know?
5041	5042	They find you...
5042	5045	very mysterious and interesting.
5049	5051	Did they tell you how l look?
5051	5055	They said that you have a remarkable body.
5057	5061	That you're very sensitive about your face but you shouldn't be.
5061	5063	Oh, and...
5065	5067	they asked me if...
5067	5070	you are as strong as you look.
5071	5073	And?
5074	5076	l said l didn't know.
5111	5113	Where the hell are you, D?
5119	5120	Here you are.
5125	5127	Do you want to know what l think about it?
5149	5152	Now, would you show me where the bathroom is?
5184	5186	l have to do a little work.
5187	5190	-lf l'm keeping you from work... -No.
5190	5192	-...l'll go. -l want you to be here.
5192	5195	l do. lt's just a tape l need to watch.
5196	5198	lt won't take long.
5205	5208	-Do you need to hear it, too? -No.
5208	5210	May l keep the music?
5269	5271	What's it about?
5273	5275	Some people l'm going to meet.
5285	5287	So then...
5289	5293	it's what? lt's a corporate promo? Some kind of homework?
5295	5298	lt's homework. Yeah.
5304	5305	That's a good idea.
5307	5310	lt's so important to be prepared.
5315	5318	My God, are you ever!
5409	5411	No. l won't give her to you. No.
5422	5426	Please, just for a little while.
5456	5457	No...
5458	5460	she's nice.
5461	5462	She's okay.
5506	5509	l had a really terrific time last night.
5510	5513	But this morning you seem like a different person.
5513	5516	-ls something wrong? -l have to go now.
5518	5520	-l have to go away. -Where?
5521	5522	On a trip.
5526	5531	-When will l see you again? -Reba, you have to get out. Now.
5535	5537	Dear Mr. Graham.:
5537	5541	Here are the Jacobis' personal effects, as discussed.
5541	5543	l hope these things might help you.
5543	5545	Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.
5564	5566	How many more times are we going to watch this?
5567	5570	''See them living,'' he said, ''right in front of you.''
5570	5572	lt's something about these home movies.
5572	5575	Lecter keeps saying, ''You looked, but didn't see.''
5575	5577	Lecter says a lot of things.
5579	5582	Sad damn thing. But we already knew that.
5583	5585	We can't afford to let Lecter waste our--
5586	5587	No. Again.
5595	5598	Your dissertation must be nearly finished, Mr. Crane.
5598	5599	Nearly.
5599	5602	lt's nice to be able to connect a face with a name...
5602	5604	after all our correspondence.
5604	5608	But, you know, you don't look like l imagined you looked.
5609	5611	What did you think l looked like?
5612	5613	Different.
5624	5625	Thank you.
5628	5630	Right there! There.
5631	5633	That's what he wanted the bolt cutter for.
5633	5636	To cut that padlock and go in through the basement.
5637	5639	But that's a different door.
5640	5643	l don't get it. The one l saw was flush steel with deadbolts.
5644	5648	Jacobi had a new door installed. Beginning of January, l think.
5648	5650	lt's in here somewhere.
5651	5653	Think he cased the house with the old door?
5653	5655	He brought the bolt cutter, didn't he?
5655	5656	He was sure he'd need it.
5656	5659	Why case it two months in advance and not check it?
5659	5661	l don't know. He was ready with the bolt cutter...
5661	5663	like at the Leeds' house.
5663	5664	There he was ready with a glass cutter.
5664	5668	He must've seen the glass when he walked in the neighborhood.
5668	5670	No. You can't see that door from the yard.
5670	5673	There's a porch lattice in the way.
5674	5676	Jack, he knew the inside of the houses.
5688	5690	Remarkable, isn't it?
5691	5693	Two hundred years old.
5695	5696	Yet so fresh.
5697	5699	So vivid.
5733	5736	He almost looks alive, doesn't he?
5781	5784	We've just gotten a report here from the....
5795	5798	Do you still have the Jacobis' check stubs...
5798	5799	and credit card statements?
5800	5802	We're looking for any kind of service call or purchase...
5802	5803	that might've required a stranger...
5803	5805	to enter the house.
5805	5808	-A repairman, delivery guy. -Anybody in the house.
5808	5809	-Yeah. -We checked.
5809	5811	l know we checked that...
5811	5813	but now we got to go back to before January.
5813	5815	-Last year's purchase orders. -Yeah.
5815	5818	-No collar. -But please hurry. lt's urgent.
5818	5819	No collar.
5819	5821	-Metcalf says-- -No collar.
5821	5824	The dog had no collar in a neighborhood of dogs...
5824	5825	but he knew which was theirs.
5825	5829	Same with the Jacobis' cat. No collar, but he knew.
5830	5833	He knew about the padlock. He knew about the pane of glass.
5833	5835	He knew the layout. He knew how to get in.
5835	5838	Every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this....
5839	5840	Oh, Jesus.
5842	5845	ls Metcalf still on the phone? Give it!
5845	5847	Byron, it's Graham.
5847	5851	You said Niles Jacobi took a few keepsakes. Do you have a list?
5851	5852	Yeah, right here.
5852	5855	l need to know if something he took was a home video.
5856	5858	A full-length VHS tape, compiled from shorter tapes.
5858	5860	-l see one videotape. -Yes?
5864	5866	But it says, ''Meet the Jacobis. ''
5868	5870	lt's Chromalux.
5872	5874	We just got a fax.
5874	5876	An incident at the Brooklyn Museum.
5876	5879	A guy attacked two employees, and get this...
5880	5882	ate the Blake painting.
5882	5883	What?
5884	5886	That's him. lt's got to be.
5886	5889	lf that painting meant so much to him, why destroy it?
5889	5892	And why didn't he kill those two women at the museum?
5892	5894	They both got a good look at him.
5897	5898	Maybe he's trying to stop.
5972	5974	Mr. Crawford, all you've got is a hunch.
5974	5977	l've got 382 employees, and they've got a union.
5977	5979	l can't just turn you loose on their files.
5979	5980	Not without a court order.
5980	5983	There are privacy issues. The company's exposure.
5983	5985	One of the employees has already killed 1 1 people...
5985	5987	that we know of.
5987	5988	lf he gets away tonight...
5988	5990	what's the company's exposure on that?
5990	5993	-l'll get our lawyers here-- -We don't have time for that.
5993	5994	Listen!
5994	5996	We're looking for a white male, 25 to 35...
5997	5998	-right-handed with brown hair. -No--
5998	6002	Listen! Please. He's strong. He's possibly a bodybuilder.
6002	6005	He might have some kind of facial disfigurement.
6005	6007	He drives a van or a panel truck.
6008	6009	That sounds like Mr. D.
6009	6010	Oh, my God.
6010	6012	Who's Mr. D?
6012	6014	Francis Dolarhyde, Manager of Technical Services.
6014	6016	What does he do exactly?
6016	6018	He maintains the equipment for tape transfers.
6018	6020	Would he have access to people's home videotapes?
6020	6023	He has access to every tape that comes through here.
6025	6027	Thanks for dinner, and thanks for letting me vent.
6027	6029	Look, no problemo.
6031	6035	Reba, listen, l know it's not my place to say this....
6036	6037	Go on.
6037	6041	Well, if Dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is...
6042	6043	maybe you ought to keep some distance.
6043	6046	l mean, what do you really know about the guy?
6046	6049	l appreciate your concern, Ralph. Really.
6049	6052	And l promise l'll give it some thought.
6054	6057	-Hey, have a great vacation. -Thanks.
6057	6060	-See you in a week. -Good night.
6072	6074	-l had a great time. -Good night.
6074	6076	Good night!
6105	6107	Ralph, just 'cause l'm feeling vulnerable--
6127	6128	Wake up.
6130	6134	You wandered around in the house while l was asleep, didn't you?
6134	6135	What?
6135	6138	The other night, did you find something odd?
6140	6143	Did you take it and show it to somebody? Did you do that?
6144	6146	D? What is it?
6146	6148	What's happening?
6148	6151	-Sit still or he'll hear us! -Who will?
6151	6153	He's upstairs.
6156	6157	He wants you, Reba.
6159	6162	l thought he was gone, but now he's back.
6162	6164	D, you're scaring me.
6167	6169	l didn't want to give you to him.
6169	6173	l did a thing for you today so he couldn't have you.
6174	6175	l was wrong.
6176	6180	You made me weak and then you hurt me.
6201	6202	No.
6203	6205	No, you can't have her!
6206	6208	Please don't let him have me.
6209	6210	You won't.
6211	6212	l'm for you.
6213	6216	You like me. l know you like me. Take me with you.
6219	6222	Take you with me? Yes. Put out your hand.
6222	6225	Feel this. That's a shotgun.
6225	6228	A 1 2-gauge magnum. Do you know what it'll do?
6229	6232	l wish l could have trusted you. l wanted to trust you.
6233	6236	You felt so good!
6236	6238	So did you.
6240	6244	-Please don't hurt me now. -lt's all over for me.
6253	6257	-Where are you? -l can't leave you to him.
6257	6259	Do you know what he'll do? He'll bite you to death.
6260	6263	He'll hurt you so bad! l can't let that happen.
6264	6268	-lt's better if you go with me. -Yes, God, get us out of here!
6268	6272	-l'll shoot you and then myself. -Oh, no.
6272	6274	-l have to shoot you. -No....
6281	6282	l can't do it.
6289	6290	D!
6313	6314	Three steps to the clock.
6314	6317	From the clock to the door, nine more.
6318	6319	Oh, God.
6324	6327	What is that? What the hell is that?
6327	6328	That's the place.
6329	6330	Goddamn it!
6330	6332	All units, that's his house that's burning.
6349	6350	FBl!
6350	6353	Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?
6353	6355	He's in there. He is dead.
6356	6357	You know that?
6357	6359	He shot himself in the face. l put my hand in it.
6359	6362	He set fire to the house. He was on the floor, and l--
6379	6381	You all right?
6393	6395	That's all l need.
6395	6397	l'd like to come back before l leave town.
6397	6399	-See how you're doing. -Sure, why not?
6399	6402	Who could resist a charmer like me?
6404	6408	You know, whatever part of him was still human...
6408	6410	was only kept alive because of you.
6410	6412	You probably saved some lives.
6414	6416	You didn't draw a freak. Okay?
6416	6418	You drew a man with a freak on his back.
6421	6422	l should have known.
6422	6427	No, sometimes you don't. Trust me, l've been there.
6430	6433	Listen to me. There was plenty wrong with Dolarhyde...
6433	6435	but there's nothing wrong with you.
6437	6438	Except your hair.
6440	6442	Your hair is a train wreck.
6442	6444	Can we please do something about that?
6444	6446	For next time, maybe? Please?
6447	6449	That would be nice.
6449	6451	-Thank you. -Just get some rest.
6451	6453	You're gonna be fine.
6459	6462	Dr. Voss, please call Pharmacy 4421.
6464	6466	We found this in his safe.
6466	6468	Thought you might want to take the first look.
6468	6469	You've earned it.
6498	6501	When l read hisjournal, it was sad.
6502	6504	lt was just so sad.
6506	6509	l couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
6511	6513	He wasn't born a monster.
6513	6517	This guy was made one through years of abuse.
6517	6520	-Hey. -Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?
6520	6522	-S'mores? -Yeah, s'mores.
6522	6524	-Yeah, you're on. -All right.
6524	6526	-Go look in the pantry. -Okay.
6535	6536	Crawford.
6536	6538	Those remains you found in the rubble.
6538	6541	-They're not Dolarhyde's. -What are you talking about?
6541	6544	-His damn dentures were there. -But not his bones.
6544	6545	Wrong DNA.
6545	6546	Then whose are they?
6546	6548	Saint Louis P.D. is looking for...
6548	6550	a Chromalux employee named Ralph Mandy.
6550	6553	He should be on vacation, so nobody missed him for a week.
6555	6557	-What is taking him so long? -Are you kidding?
6557	6561	lt takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning.
6561	6564	Yeah, but now l have a serious marshmallow jones.
6572	6574	Josh, what are you doing?
6586	6589	We can't come to the phone. You know the deal.
6589	6591	Wait for the beep.
6592	6596	lt's Jack. lt's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.
6596	6599	l'm scrambling everything that rolls or flies...
6599	6600	but they'll take time to arrive.
6601	6602	Will?
6603	6605	Christ, Will, where are you?
6660	6663	Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.
6668	6670	Your son is about to change.
6671	6672	Then your wife.
6673	6675	You can watch.
6676	6677	Then l'll take care of you.
6680	6682	Look at you.
6682	6686	l've never seen a child as disgusting as you!
6686	6689	You pissed your pants? How dare you!
6691	6694	You dirty little beast. You want me to cut it off?
6695	6697	Want me to do that, you little freak?
6697	6698	You want me to cut it off?
6698	6701	Do you? Don't cry at me, you little faggot!
6702	6706	Apologize! Say, ''l'm sorry, Daddy! l'm a dirty little beast.
6707	6709	''l'm a freak.'' Say it!
6709	6710	-No. -Say it!
6710	6712	-Dad! -Say it, or l will cut it off!
6713	6715	''l'm a dirty little beast.
6715	6717	''Freak! Harelip!
6717	6719	''And no one will ever love me. ''
6721	6723	Josh, run! Run!
6732	6733	Get down!
6735	6736	You okay?
6752	6754	-Josh? -Mom?
6755	6756	Will?
6757	6759	Where are you guys?
6761	6763	l thought l heard some kind of....
6765	6766	Will?
6767	6768	Molly, get down!
6782	6783	Will!
6795	6796	Shoot....
6798	6799	What?
6799	6801	Shoot him. Shoot him.
6818	6819	Mommy?
6832	6835	My dear Will.: You must be healed by now.
6835	6837	On the outside, at least.
6837	6840	l hope you're not too ugly.
6840	6842	What a collection of scars you have!
6842	6844	Never forget who gave you the best of them.
6845	6846	And be grateful.
6846	6850	Our scars have the power to remind us the past was real.
6851	6853	We live in a primitive time, don't we, Will?
6853	6855	Neither savage nor wise.
6855	6857	Half measures are the curse of it.
6857	6861	A rational society would either kill me or put me to some use.
6863	6866	Do you dream much, Will? l think of you often.
6868	6870	Your old friend, Hannibal Lecter.
6888	6891	Hannibal? There's someone here to see you.
6891	6894	Wants to ask a few questions. l said you'd probably refuse.
6895	6899	A young woman. Says she's from the FBl.
6899	6902	Though she's far too pretty, if you ask me.
6903	6905	l'll tell her you said no.
6910	6912	What is her name?
