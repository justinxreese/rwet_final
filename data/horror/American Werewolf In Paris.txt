1153	1158	Most guys who ask me on a date are usually trying to get me into bed.
1159	1161	That must be really terrible for a girl when that happens.
1161	1164	Why should I think you're any different?
1164	1166	Isn't that why you brought your friends along?

1169	1171	No, that's not it at all.
1174	1176	Chewing gum.
1176	1179	It's, uh, the rage in the States.

1189	1191	- [ Latex Squeaking ] - Nice.
1193	1195	And chewy.
1196	1198	I want you to blow a big bubble for me.
1199	1201	What?
1201	1204	Well, it's a custom in France.
1204	1207	The bigger the bubble, the more a boy likes a girl.
1222	1223	[ Disgusted Sigh ]
1229	1231	Wow. What a rip-off.
1231	1236	My friends told me it was chewing gum. I thought--
1236	1238	I think it's best if I go.
1238	1241	No, no, please, don't go. I'm just so nervous.
1241	1244	And the more I like a girl, the more nervous I get.
1244	1247	And if you go now and something happens to you,
1247	1251	then I'd blame myself for the rest of my life because I'd blown my chance to help.
1257	1261	The moment I saw you on the Tower, I was so moved by your sadness.
1261	1264	I swore to myself I would try to help, whatever it takes.
1264	1268	No one as beautiful and sensitive as you...
1268	1270	can possibly deserve to be so sad.
1280	1285	Oh, God. I hate myself. I am not the kind of guy you think I am.
1285	1287	If I go, it's nothing to do with you.
1287	1291	No one can help me. And anyone who tries is--
1291	1295	I hope you're not sorry that I saved your life.

1353	1355	Do you-- Do you work out?
1363	1365	Do you want me to leave?
1369	1372	I guess that means yes.

1412	1415	I have to go now. You mustn't get involved.
1416	1418	Wait. When do I get to see you again?
1419	1422	I don't think we should. Andy, it's only because I care about you.

1425	1428	[ Chris ] Relax, man. She's just playing hard to get.
1428	1432	This whole mysterious elusive thing is just a ploy to make her more interesting.
1432	1437	It's not that simple. The way she talks about her parents, it's like she blames herself.
1437	1441	Yeah. She's demented enough. Remember the blood on her hands?
1441	1444	That stunt at the cafe? [ Imitating Punches ]

3701	3704	It only keeps alive the weak, the stupid, the lazy,
3705	3708	who breed and multiply, weakening the human race.
3708	3710	All my men, I have chosen...
3711	3714	for their loyalty, their dedication to the coming age.
3714	3717	But you--
3718	3720	You were not to have been.
3723	3727	You were an accident, an anomaly.
3727	3730	I do not wish to kill you.
3730	3735	I pray you will join us in our rise to become the new mankind.
3735	3738	Pure, free of disease.
3738	3741	Free from the trappings of technological advance.
3743	3746	Will you join us, Andy?
3748	3751	I don't know. That's, you know-- That's a big decision.
3751	3755	- Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna need some time to think about that.
3756	3758	Sure.
3765	3768	[ Gasping ] Andy?
3772	3776	- Well, what's that for? - Kill him, Andy.

3790	3793	Release him, Andy.
3803	3806	Join us.
3809	3812	You can't ask me to do this.

3957	3960	- What is it? - Did you know what he plans to do?
3960	3964	- [ Sighs ] Yes, I did. - And you did nothing to stop him?
3964	3967	- Andy, l-- - How in God's name could you just stand by--
3967	3971	For God's sake! Stop it! We may have a cure.
3974	3977	Thierry, my stepfather.
3980	3982	- Claude? - No.
3982	3985	You?
3985	3988	And my mother too.
3988	3991	For a time, I had managed not to harm anyone.
3991	3995	Even the hearts my mother smuggled from the hospital were from the dead.
3995	3998	Two months ago, he was sure he had discovered...
3998	4002	a serum to suppress my lycanthropic cycle.
4002	4004	Only it had the reverse effect.
4004	4006	I immediately transformed.
4009	4012	My mother heard the noise from upstairs,
4012	4015	and Thierry tried to escape through the underground.
4019	4022	When I came to,
4022	4024	I saw I had butchered my own parents.
4026	4029	Now do you see why I was trying to kill myself?
4029	4031	It's not your fault.
4036	4040	Don't worry about me. It's Chris who has problems.
4040	4043	We gotta get him out of there.
4043	4046	[ Gasps ]

4226	4228	Serafine, it's-- He's gone.
4228	4231	Let it go.
4231	4233	- No. - Yes.
4233	4235	[ Crying ]
4235	4237	They killed him, the bastards.
4238	4239	[ Sniffling ]
4240	4242	What do we do now?
4242	4244	Well, let me have a shot at it.
4244	4249	But they ruined the lab. So many years of hard work.
4249	4251	Did your stepfather leave any notes?
4251	4254	There.
4258	4260	What does that represent?
4260	4263	A werewolf's biorhythm...
4263	4266	and how it's governed by the cycles of the moon.
4266	4269	Thierry tried to keep me below the transformation threshold...
4269	4272	by injecting me with a depressant.
4272	4274	And it had a reverse effect.
4274	4277	- Yeah. - All right.
4277	4280	Just so I'm totally clear here, with this drug,
4280	4284	you can induce a transformation at any time of the month?
4284	4287	Oh, my God. The samples. He left them in the cupboard.
