493	495	Oh, shit!
503	505	Damn, what the hell happened?
505	507	What the fuck y'all did to the stage?
507	510	Too much ammonia? Not enough nitrogen?

521	522	We're talking video promo, publishing rights...
522	523	record deals. All that shit.
523	527	Only record deal you're getting is with the the L.A.P.D.

551	554	It's an iodine/ammonia compound.
554	556	Fool, you're going to wind up in a compound.
556	558	The hell with it, we fucked up.
558	561	See, Stray, you're thinking with a spirit of failure.
561	563	You really do need to hook up some Tony Robbins.
563	565	That big, white goofy-lookin' mo'fo'?
565	567	Always talking about <if a tree fall in the bathroom...
567	569	take time to stop and smell the forest>...
570	571	That ain't right.
571	573	See, our unconscious beliefs control our behavior.
573	577	Only through daily positive, positive affirmation can we overcome.
577	581	Yeah, well, affirmate this, motherfuckers.
581	584	If we don't get this equipment fixed...
584	586	we ain't winning no contest...
586	589	we ain't going to no Vegas and we ain't ever leaving Compton.

2178	2181	I also love me some cash. You know the drill. Hand it over.
2181	2183	Ain't no scrubs up in here.
2185	2191	Every little bit helps Miss Fontaine get her operation.
2191	2195	Go get your stuff. Go put it out back. Let me hear you jam.
2203	2205	Who's there?
2209	2214	Counting ill-gotten gains will cause you suffering and pain.
2215	2217	Who's there?
2254	2258	They call me Stray. You know that I can pull it with no delay.
2258	2262	I'm a waistband...don't you know I'm from the wasteland...
2262	2264	From the dome, I roam through the chromozome...

2371	2373	Dope is the track. Gold got it back...
2373	2376	Better get lost, next step, that's a fact.
2376	2378	This be the story, ain't got no glory...
2378	2381	No place to go but up, that's where it's at!
2381	2382	Yeah.

2440	2443	Oh, handy...
2447	2449	Yeah!
2449	2452	Did we rock that shit? - Rocked that shit.
2452	2454	Homie, they couldn't get enough of us.
2454	2456	I could have got me some pussy.
2457	2459	Straight to Vegas, baby.
2462	2464	With Mack Daddy on our ass. - Aw, fuck him.
2464	2466	By the time he finds us...
2466	2468	we're already gonna be large.
2470	2472	He ain't gonna stop until he gets this.
2472	2474	Shit, give it to him.
2474	2476	We can't.
2478	2482	Shit, you boys was too, too fine tonight.
2485	2487	Good night, boys.
2489	2492	Who was he talkin' to? - He was talkin' to your ass.
2492	2495	He was talking to you. - He was talkin' to Post.
2495	2497	Fuck that.
2497	2499	You wanna hit that, Post?
2514	2517	Couldn't find your way out, baby?
2517	2520	Or, you just didn't wanna leave?
2520	2525	I didn't come to play with fruit. I only seek me magic flute.
2525	2528	That's such a musical way of putting it.
2530	2532	You just the right size, too...
2532	2535	for Miss Fontaine.
2540	2544	I hope you ain't a screamer 'cause I got me some company.
2544	2547	So get your ass up in there. Come on now.
2553	2556	Why you think Mack Daddy wants it back so bad?
2556	2558	That ain't no magic flute. My ass.
2563	2564	What the fuck was that?
2569	2573	That's probably Fontaine havin' a nightmare.
2596	2599	Mr. Funny-Boy got company.
2604	2606	Man, I'm gonna be sick, man.
2624	2627	Shit--that little green motherfucker's out there, man.
2634	2638	Ohh, shit! He ain't dead.
2638	2641	Meta-fuckin'-physical, man.
2641	2644	What are we gonna do? - I don't know, man.
2647	2649	What the fuck is we gonna do, y'all?
2651	2654	Flute... where's me flute?
2657	2660	See, the mix of a douche...
2665	2667	and a jelly...
2667	2671	is very, very, very combustible.
2674	2676	Combustability...
2677	2678	plus electricity...
2681	2683	equals flammability.
2683	2685	Damn, you smart, man.
2705	2706	Post...
2706	2709	go over there and cut the light on when he comes in here.
2712	2715	Stray...
2715	2718	go and get the little motherfucker in here, man.
2722	2725	Come on, man. - All right.
2730	2734	Yo, shorty, you ain't even as big as my dick.
2752	2754	Now, Post, now!
2781	2784	I don't get it. This piece of shit?
2784	2786	Y'all still don't get it?
2786	2788	We fuckin' with the spiritual world, man.
2788	2792	We unleashed a whole supernatural universal wack-pack.
2792	2795	Sanctuary's against that shit.
2795	2798	That's what we need right now, some sanctuary.
2798	2801	We need to go to Rev. Hanson's church.
2801	2804	We could slide him some Benjamins, and stay there for the night.
2805	2807	I gotta see my grandmother, make sure she's all right.
2807	2810	Post, is that you?
2810	2812	Yeah, it's me, Grandma. I lost my keys.
2812	2814	Oh, all right.
2819	2821	Hey, Grandma.
2821	2824	Boy, where you been?
2824	2826	I needed somebody to massage my bunions.
2826	2829	I had stuff to do with Stray and Butch, that's all.
2829	2833	Them lazy-ass hood boys. You know they ain't good for nothin'.
2836	2842	Oh, hello, Stray. How's your mama? - She's good, Mrs. Smith.
2842	2846	She still sneakin' around with Jackie Dee?
2853	2856	That you, Butch? - Yes, ma'am.
2856	2860	Boy, is you still a virgin? - Yes, ma'am.
2860	2861	What's wrong with you, son?
2862	2865	Big ol' strappin' boy like you? You got bad teeth or something?
2865	2867	No, ma'am.
2868	2870	There's hot soup over there on the stove...
2870	2872	with plenty of hot sauce just like y'all like it.
2874	2876	Why motherfuckers want this so bad?
2876	2879	I'm tellin' you, man. It's magical.
2879	2881	Bullshit.
2881	2884	Watch this. Cover your ears.
2893	2895	Butch?
2897	2901	Sanctuary, man. We need sanctuary... quick.
2925	2927	The Lord, I say...!
2927	2930	... is good.
2930	2933	For he has delivered unto me...
2933	2935	the worst of Satan's sinners.
2936	2937	Praise God.
2937	2940	Reverend Hanson, we need sanctuary in your sanctuary.
2940	2944	We tryin' to hide from Mack Daddy. He's about to go on a killin' spree.
2944	2946	We're the spree he's tryin' to kill.
2946	2950	You're saying you need a place to slither away and hide out?
2950	2952	Yeah, just for one day, then we're outta here.
2953	2958	Let's see... hotel rates run about...
2958	2960	We give you $50 dollars, and we square.
2964	2968	That's nice, real nice. But there's one more thing.
2968	2971	What?
2971	2975	Our musical entertainment for this morning got cancelled.
2975	2978	Seems, the lead singer got his ass arrested again.
2979	2982	I know you boys are musically inclined...
2982	2985	and I suspect you might be available for...
2985	2986	one song.
2989	2990	It's so good...
2991	2993	to see a full house, in the Lord's house.
2995	2998	Amen.
2998	3002	As we pass the collection plate...
3003	3004	I want you to remember one thing.
3004	3007	The Lord, I say...
3007	3009	the Lord, sees everything.
3011	3014	The Lord don't like cheap.
3015	3019	So I want you to dig deep into your pockets, now...
3019	3020	and show your love.
3021	3025	But first, about our musical entertainment for today...
3027	3030	We have three young lads coming to you...
3030	3033	straight from the Southside of Jerusalem.
3033	3036	I said, the Southside of Jerusalem.
3036	3039	I want you to make these boys feel welcome today.
3039	3042	Bring 'em on down, and show some love.
3046	3048	Lord works in mysterious ways...
3048	3050	Amen, man.
3052	3053	The Lord is good.
3058	3063	Jesus loves me, this I know...
3065	3069	If he don't, I'll find a... ho'.
3077	3080	His mama's name was--
3080	3084	Mary... Jo.
3088	3091	And his disciples was--
3091	3095	... some bad mo' fo's...
3099	3102	That's fine, fellas, that's fine.
3102	3106	The Lord has heard many a strange tongue in this house.
3106	3109	And we have learned not to judge what we see...
3110	3113	but to the content, and the fiber of a young--
3140	3142	Yo, that's... Coolio.
3146	3149	Jesus loves me, this I know...
3149	3151	If he don't, I find a ho'.
3151	3154	His mama's name, was Mary Jo...
3154	3156	His disciples was some bad mo' fo's.
3156	3158	Little ones, goin' out to the crack house...
3158	3161	They're all weak, Jesus gave a shout out...
3161	3164	<Try to stay strong, 'cause we belong...
3164	3166	To the fold, we gone before long.>
3166	3169	Jesus loves me... - I don't know...
3169	3171	Jesus loves me... - The hell if I know.
3171	3174	If Jesus loves me, then it's my day.
3174	3177	We better pray... - Or he'll make us pay.
3177	3179	The Lord's name, I take it in vain.
3179	3182	Why don't you, Jesus, come stop the pain?
3182	3184	Jesus works in a mysterious way.
3184	3187	That ain't no answer, I'm gonna do it my way.
3187	3189	Jesus loves us, we don't know...
3189	3192	Jesus loves us? The hell if we know.
3192	3194	Jesus works in a mysterious way...
3194	3197	That ain't no answer. We gonna do it our way.
3197	3199	Yeah.
3202	3203	Three bad boys.
3203	3205	Give it up, come on, now.
3217	3219	Damn.
3219	3220	You believe me now?
3222	3225	No wonder Mack Daddy was so pissed off.
3225	3227	This is fortune, right here.
3227	3228	That's right.
3231	3233	You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
3235	3237	That's the key, man.
3237	3239	The key to everything we ever wanted.
3239	3242	Man, that's the key to our goddamn coffin.
3242	3245	Y'all must be forgettin' Mack Daddy gonna kill our ass...
3245	3247	if he don't get that shit back.
3247	3249	We went in his house, fucked his shit up...
3249	3254	You think he'll let us live, 'cause we gave him his flute back?
3256	3258	Aw, shit, man. We're about to find out.
3261	3263	Oh, shit.
3263	3265	I'm sure the motherfuckers is up there.
3281	3283	We don't go down without a fight.
3285	3287	Right? - Right.
3287	3289	Right?
3289	3291	Right.
3291	3294	Right? - Right.
3314	3316	Freeze, you little stealin' motherfuckers!
3320	3323	I finally got your ass. Where's my goddamn flute?
3323	3326	I got your flute. I don't have it on me, but I know where it is.
3326	3328	Stop fuckin' with me! Gimme the goddamn flute, now!
3328	3331	I can get the flute, but if you kill me then you can't have it.
3333	3336	What about Mr. Leprechaun? The flute belongs to him, anyway.
3336	3338	Fuck that little motherfucker. I should've killed him a long time ago.
3339	3340	Fuck him.
3340	3342	You need to figure out what you're going to do about him...
3342	3345	because he's right behind your ass.
3345	3346	I'm supposed to fall for that shit?
3347	3349	That's the oldest trick in the book. You gotta come better than that, nigga.
3349	3351	Blow this motherfucker's head off.
3351	3353	With pleasure.
3353	3355	Did somebody say, ?
3356	3357	Hallelujah.
3377	3379	You were sayin'?
3388	3390	I'll get back with you niggas later.
3393	3394	All right, dammit, what the hell is goin' on...?!
3400	3402	What the hell you boys think you're doin'?
3402	3404	Man, we got the whole world after our ass.
3404	3407	? - Only the bad motherfuckers.
3422	3424	Why don't you give the little bastard his flute...
3424	3426	and let's get up outta here, man?
3448	3450	We dealin' with some evil supernatural shit here, man.
3470	3471	I got an idea.
3486	3490	All kidding aside... it's time to die.
3506	3508	Damn...
3508	3510	What kinda voodoo shit you boys into?
3529	3534	You can stop that goddamned yelling. This is the Lord's house!
3534	3536	Ain't nobody in here afraid of your ass.
3540	3542	I don't hear nothin'.
3542	3543	Let's try it again.
3555	3559	It's hooked up right, man. We can't sample it.
3559	3561	It won't record.
3561	3563	Fuck it. We gotta use the real deal.
3564	3566	Either way, we're going to Vegas for the big money.
3566	3568	Straight up. Let's get this show on the road.
3569	3570	Let's do this shit.
3570	3572	Vegas? What the fuck y'all talkin' about, "Vegas"?
3572	3574	Nobody goin' nowhere with that thing locked up in my office.
3574	3578	You know what? Just keep that safe locked.
3578	3581	You expect me to babysit the goddamn Devil, huh?
3581	3584	He's up there sittin' on my operating funds.
3584	3586	Reverend, we're about to hit the jackpot.
3586	3588	When we come back, we'll split the pot with you.
3588	3590	Then, we'll figure out what to do with that fuckin' devil.
3590	3593	Just make sure his ass don't get out.
3593	3595	Let's get out of here, man.
3595	3599	What about Mack Daddy, man?
3608	3610	What about Mack Daddy?
3610	3613	Youngblood, how'd you know about my gun?

4432	4434	I don't want you goin' by yourself, man.
4434	4435	Goin' where?
4435	4438	To get the Leprechaun. To get that flute back.
4438	4441	How do you know I'm goin'? - Ain't you?
4444	4446	Yeah, I guess I am.
4447	4449	What the hell is that around your damn head?
4449	4452	I got a plan, man.
4452	4454	Yo, Post
4454	4456	I was reading earlier...
4456	4458	Leprechauns is rumored to be the dark elves of Satan.
4459	4461	Each with his own pot of gold.
4461	4464	They so small, peeps are always tryin' to capture 'em.
4464	4467	The gold is the ransom for their freedom.
4467	4470	Anybody fuckin' with their shit...
4470	4473	is hunted down and killed in a most brutal manner.
4473	4475	Yeah, no shit.
4475	4477	So, what's your plan?
4482	4484	This.
4485	4486	Weed?
4486	4489	Man, this ain't just weed, Post.
4489	4492	This weed's got clovers in it. Four-leaf clovers.
4492	4493	What?
4493	4496	According to this book...
4496	4499	a leprechaun can lose his powers temporarily...
4499	4502	if he's hit with the essence of a four-leaf clover.
4502	4504	How are we supposed to find the Leprechaun?
4504	4506	I was sneaking around the Golden Parrot.
4506	4509	The Leprechaun got a goddamn room upstairs.
4509	4511	He got them zombie ho's hypnotizing people.
4512	4515	Taking them up to him, every night.
4515	4517	Word? What for? - I don't know...
4517	4520	but they don't be comin' back downstairs after they go up.
4520	4522	I think he's fuckin' 'em to death.
4522	4526	We gotta get in there, get him stoned off these clovers...
4526	4529	grab the flute, and run like hell while he's still trippin'.
4531	4533	That's a good plan, Post.
4534	4536	How are we supposed to get close to his ass?
4536	4539	Only one way, bro'.
4583	4586	Remember, Mack Daddy's still out there.
4586	4588	he gonna be comin' after our ass, too.
4593	4595	Fuck Mack Daddy.
4596	4598	Ain't nothin' but a hip-hop thang.
4600	4602	Business in the hood.
4603	4605	Let's do this.
4633	4638	Lep in the hood... come to do no good.
4642	4644	What happened?
4644	4646	Tell me where the Leprechaun is.
4646	4649	It's okay, just tell me where he is, and I'll let you go.
4661	4664	Damn, Post. You look good, for real.
4664	4667	Fuck you, nigga. You ready for this shit?
4667	4670	I'm ready for this shit, man. Let's do it.

4732	4736	Sit down, sit down, my healthy filly.
4737	4739	You're about to meet a club named, .
4756	4759	They say in the hood, you're never down...
4759	4765	unless you've the courage to go downtown.
4801	4803	Come on, man.
4810	4812	On to Vegas, baby. - All the way for Stray, man.
4818	4821	Butch...?
4825	4828	Not in a dress, Post...
4829	4832	You're gonna be okay, man.
4836	4839	Is there pussy in heaven, Post?
4845	4847	Okay, little girls, come on out!
4847	4850	You can't hide. It's goin' down.
4853	4856	Come on out, bitches. Mack Daddy wants his flute.
4874	4875	What's up, ?
4875	4878	Man, I must say, you are fine.
4879	4883	Are you finished playing? Gimme the goddamn flute.
4883	4885	Fuck you, motherfucker.
4886	4887	Oh, yeah, fuck me...
4887	4889	You look real tough, you got a gun and everything...
4890	4891	but you ain't about to kill shit.
4891	4894	Plus, you're forgetting about the little motherfucker upstairs.
4896	4899	There's only one way to deal with him, and that's me.
4901	4904	I got the one thing that can put that leprechaun on ice forever.
4904	4907	So, what you gonna do, tough guy? You gonna try to kill me...
4907	4909	or are we gonna work together and kill this motherfucker?
4909	4911	'Cause you ain't no motherfucking gangster.
4911	4914	I'm supposed to trust you now?
4914	4919	I wouldn't advise you to trust me; that'd be the worst thing you could do.
4919	4922	But right now, we got no options.
4922	4925	And you really ain't got no options.
4925	4928	You ain't no motherfucking gangster.
4932	4935	Get that gun out of my face. You ain't about to kill nothin'...
4965	4967	Cross-dressing impostor!
4983	4986	For a foe of mine, you've done quite well.
4986	4991	Now, I'll take me flute, and send you to hell.
4991	4995	If this is to be Post's last stand...
4995	4999	you'll have to take this flute from me cold, dead hand.
5000	5003	I'll take it from you, homie, you'll see...
