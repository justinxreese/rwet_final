172	174	You never did eat your lunch, did you?
174	178	I better get back to the office. These extended lunch hours...
178	180	give my boss excess acid.
180	182	Why don't you call your boss and tell him...
182	184	you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?
184	186	It's Friday anyway, and hot.
186	191	What do I do with my free afternoon? Walk you to the airport?
191	194	Well, we could laze around here a while longer.
194	198	Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.
198	201	Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in...
201	204	but when your time is up...
204	207	Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
207	209	I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend a night...
209	210	in a cheap hotel.
210	214	When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
215	217	You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
217	220	Oh, Sam, this is the last time.
220	224	- Yeah? For what? - For this.
224	228	For meeting you in secret so we can be secretive.
228	230	You come down here on business trips...
231	233	and we steal lunch hours.
233	236	I wish you wouldn't even come.
236	240	What do we do instead? Write each other lurid love letters?
240	242	Oh, I have to go, Sam.
244	247	- I can come down next week. - No.
248	253	Not even just to see you? Have lunch in public?
253	257	Oh, we can see each other. We can even have dinner.
257	259	But respectably.
259	262	In my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and...
262	266	my sister helping me broil a big steak for three.
266	268	And after the steak, do we send sister to the movies...
268	270	turn Mama's picture to the wall?
270	272	Sam!
274	276	All right.
282	285	Marion, whenever it's possible, I want to see you.
285	290	And under any circumstances, even respectability.
290	293	You make respectability sound disrespectful.
293	299	I'm all for it. It requires patience, temperance, a lot of sweating out.
299	303	Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.
303	308	But if I can see you and touch you even as simply as this, I won't mind it.
310	313	I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there.
313	316	I sweat to pay off my father's debts, and he's in his grave.
316	319	I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living...
319	320	on the other side of the world.
322	323	I pay too.
325	328	They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
329	333	A couple of years and my debts will be paid off.
333	335	If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.
335	340	- I haven't even been married once yet. - But when you do, you'll swing.
340	343	Oh, Sam, let's get married.
347	352	And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale?
352	354	We'll have lots of laughs. I'll tell you what.
354	358	When I send my ex-wife her alimony, you can lick the stamps.
358	361	I'll lick the stamps.
368	373	You want to cut this off, go out and find yourself somebody available?
373	376	I'm thinking of it.
379	382	How could you even think a thing like that?
382	385	- Don't miss your plane. - We can leave together, can't we?
385	389	Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh, you have to put your shoes on.
402	404	Isn't Mr Lowery back from lunch?
404	407	He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property.
407	411	The old lease man. That's why he's late. You got a headache?
411	414	It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions...
414	417	you forget them as soon as they stop hurting.
417	420	Have you got some aspirin? I've got something, not aspirin.
420	422	My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding.
423	426	Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquillizers.
426	428	Any calls?
428	432	Teddy called me. My mother called to see if Teddy called.
432	435	Oh, your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying...
436	438	- and she'll be gone the whole weekend...
441	446	Wow. It's as hot as fresh milk.
446	450	Hey, you girls oughta get your boss to air condition ya up.
450	452	He can afford it today.
453	456	Marion, will you get the copies of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?
456	460	- Yes, sir. - Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.
460	463	Oh... Oh, not you. My daughter.
463	465	A baby.
466	470	Tomorrow she stands her sweet self up there and gets married away from me.
471	475	- I want you to take a look at my baby.
477	479	Eighteen years old...
479	484	and she never had an unhappy day in any one of those years.
484	487	Come on, Tom. My office is air conditioned.
487	489	Do you know what I do about unhappiness?
489	492	I buy it off.
492	494	Are, uh... Are you unhappy?
495	498	Uh, not inordinately.
500	504	I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present.
504	507	Forty thousand dollars cash.
508	511	Now that's... that's not buying happiness.
511	514	That's just buying off unhappiness.
516	520	I never carry more than I can afford to lose.
520	522	- Count 'em! - I declare!
522	526	I don't. That's how I get to keep it.
526	530	Tom, a cash transaction of this size is most irregular.
530	533	Ah, so what? It's my private money.
533	536	- Now it's yours. - Suppose we put it in the safe...
536	539	and then Monday morning when you're feeling good...
540	545	Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's that bottle you said was in your desk?
545	549	Uh-oh.
549	553	You know, uh, sometimes I can keep my mouth shut.
559	562	Lowery, I am dying of "thirst-aroonie."
564	567	I don't even want it in the office over the weekend.
567	572	Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank, and we'll get a cheque on Monday.
572	575	Yes.
579	583	He was flirting with you. I guess he must've noticed my wedding ring.
596	598	Come in.
600	604	The copies. If you don't mind, I'd like to go home after the bank.
604	607	- I have a slight... - You go right on home.
607	610	Because me and your boss are goin' out and get ourselves...
610	612	a little drinkin' done, right?
612	614	- Of course. Do you feel ill? - Just a headache.
615	619	What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas, the playground of the world.
619	621	I'm going to spend this weekend in bed. Thank you.
624	629	Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.
629	632	Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.
632	637	I guess I'll go put this money in the bank and then go home and sleep it off.
759	763	Marion, what in the world... What are you doing up here?
763	765	Of course I'm glad to see you. I always am.
766	769	What is it, Marion?
866	869	- Uh, hold it there.
874	876	In quite a hurry.
876	882	I didn't intend to sleep so long. I almost had an accident from sleepiness.
882	886	- So, I decided to pull over. - You slept here all night?
886	890	Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes open.
890	893	There are plenty of motels in this area. You should've...
893	895	I mean, just to be safe.
895	898	I didn't intend to sleep all night. I just pulled over.
898	900	Have I broken any laws?
901	903	- No, ma'am. - Then I'm free to go?
904	907	Is anything wrong?
907	911	Of course not. Am I acting as if there's something wrong?
911	916	- Frankly, yes. - Please, I'd like to go.
916	919	- Well, is there? - Is there what?
921	924	I've told you there's nothing wrong, except I'm in a hurry...
924	926	and you're taking up my time.
926	928	- Now, just a moment.
928	931	- Turn your motor off, please.
931	934	May I see your licence?
937	940	- Why? - Please.
1065	1068	Be with you in a second!
1132	1134	- I'm in no mood for trouble. - What?
1134	1137	There's an old saying: "First customer of the day is always the most trouble."
1137	1139	But I'm in no mood for it...
1139	1142	so I'm gonna treat you so fair you won't have one reason...
1142	1145	- Can I trade my car and take another? - Do anything you have a mind to.
1145	1148	Bein' a woman, you will. That yours?
1148	1151	Yes, it's, it's... There's nothing wrong with it. I just...
1151	1153	Sick of the sight of it.
1153	1157	Have a look around and see if there's something that strikes your eyes...
1157	1159	and I'll have my mechanic give yours the once-over.
1159	1161	- You want some coffee? - No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...
1161	1163	and just wanna make a change.
1163	1166	One thing people never oughta be when they're buyin' used cars...
1166	1168	and that's in a hurry, but like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
1169	1171	I'll shoot your car in the garage here.
1192	1194	That's the one I'd have picked for you myself.
1194	1196	- How much? - Go ahead.
1196	1198	- Spin it around the block. - It looks fine.
1198	1200	How much would it be with my car?
1200	1203	You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?
1203	1207	You are in a hurry, aren't you? Somebody chasin' ya?
1207	1209	Of course not. Please.
1209	1215	Well, it's the first time the customer ever high pressured the salesman.
1215	1220	Ah, I figure roughly...
1220	1223	your car plus $700.
1223	1227	- Seven hundred. - You always got time to argue money.
1228	1230	All right.
1234	1237	I take it you can prove that car is yours.
1237	1240	I mean, out-of-state licence. You got your pink slip...
1240	1243	I believe I have the necessary papers. Is there a ladies room?
1243	1246	In the building.
1257	1259	Over there.
1315	1318	I think you better take it for a trial spin.
1318	1321	I don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
1321	1324	I'd really rather not. Can't we just settle this...
1324	1328	I might as well be perfectly honest with you. It's not that I don't trust you...
1328	1331	But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong...
1332	1334	about making a decision and wanting to hurry?
1334	1337	- Do you think I've stolen my car? - No, ma'am.
1338	1341	All right, let's go inside.
1377	1379	Hey!
1386	1389	Just put it in here, please.
1391	1393	Thank you.
1401	1404	Heck, Officer, that was the first time...
1404	1407	I saw the customer high pressure the salesman.
1407	1409	Somebody chasin' her?
1409	1412	I better have a look at those papers, Charlie.
1412	1416	- She look like a wrong one to you? - Acted like one.
1416	1420	The only funny thing, she paid me $700 in cash.
1428	1430	Yes, Mr Lowery.
1430	1433	Caroline. Marion still isn't in?
1433	1436	No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
1437	1440	Buzz me the minute she comes in.
1440	1443	And call her sister. No one's answering at the house.
1443	1448	I called her sister where she works... The Music Makers Music Store...
1448	1451	and she doesn't know where Marion is any more than we do.
1451	1455	You better run out to the house. She may be, well, unable to answer the phone.
1455	1458	Her sister's going to do that. She's as worried as we are.
1461	1464	No, I haven't the faintest idea.
1464	1467	As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday.
1467	1471	She said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early, and I said she could.
1471	1473	That was the last I saw... Oh, wait a minute.
1474	1477	I did see her some time later driving...
1477	1481	Uh, I think you'd better come over here to my office, quick.
1481	1484	Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.
1486	1490	After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!
1490	1493	I'm not taking the responsibility.
1493	1497	Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works for you for ten years, you trust her.
1497	1499	All right, yes, you better come over.
1501	1505	Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!
1505	1507	I'll get it back, and if any of it's missin', I'll replace it...
1507	1509	with her fine, soft flesh!
1509	1512	- We'll track her, never you doubt it. -  Hold on, Cassidy.
1512	1517	I still can't believe... It must be some kind of a mystery. l, I can't...
1517	1521	You checked with the bank, no? They never laid eyes on her, no?
1521	1525	You still trustin'? Hot creepers! She sat there while I dumped it out!
1525	1530	Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'. And, and even flirtin' with me!
1675	1680	Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.
1685	1687	- Dirty night. - Do you have a vacancy?
1688	1692	Oh, we have 12 vacancies. 12 cabins, 12 vacancies.
1692	1695	They, uh... They moved away the highway.
1695	1699	Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.
1699	1704	I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops here any more unless they've done that.
1704	1708	But... there's no sense dwelling on our losses.
1708	1713	We just keep on lighting the lights and following the formalities.
1716	1720	Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
1723	1726	Los Angeles.
1732	1737	Cabin one. It's closer in case you want anything. It's right next to the office.
1737	1739	I want sleep more than anything else, except maybe food.
1740	1743	There's a big diner about ten miles up the road, just outside of Fairvale.
1743	1748	- Am I that close to Fairvale? - Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
1767	1769	Boy, it's stuffy in here.
1775	1777	Well, the, uh, mattress is soft and...
1778	1780	there's hangers in the closet and stationary...
1780	1782	with "Bates Motel" printed on it...
1782	1786	in case you wanna make your friends back home feel envious.
1786	1788	And the, uh...
1789	1792	- Over there. - The bathroom.
1792	1794	Yeah.
1794	1799	Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything, just... just tap on the wall.
1799	1801	- I'll be in the office. - Thank you, Mr Bates.
1801	1803	Norman Bates.
1806	1809	You're not really gonna go out again and drive up to the diner, are you?
1809	1811	- No. - Then would you do me a favour?
1812	1813	Would you have dinner with me?
1813	1818	I was just about to myself. Nothing special... just sandwiches and milk.
1818	1822	But I'd like it very much if you'd come up to the house.
1822	1825	I don't set a fancy table, but the kitchen's awful homey.
1827	1829	- I'd like to. - All right.
1829	1832	You get yourself settled and, and take off your wet shoes.
1832	1835	- I'll be back as soon as it's ready. - Okay.
1835	1839	- With my... With my trusty umbrella.
1919	1922	No! I tell you no!
1922	1925	I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper!
1925	1929	By candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap, erotic fashion...
1929	1933	- of young men with cheap, erotic minds! -  Mother, please.
1933	1936	And then what, after supper? Music? Whispers?
1936	1939	Mother, she's just a stranger. She's hungry and it's raining out.
1939	1945	"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if men don't desire strangers. As if...
1945	1949	Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting things, because they disgust me!
1949	1952	Do you understand, boy? Go on.
1952	1955	Go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite...
1955	1958	with my food or my son!
1958	1961	Or do I have to tell her 'cause you don't have the guts?
1961	1965	- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy? - Shut up! Shut up!
2007	2011	- I've caused you some trouble. - No, uh...
2011	2014	Mother... My mother, uh...
2014	2016	What is the phrase?
2016	2020	She isn't quite herself today.
2020	2025	You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
2025	2028	Oh, I'm sorry.
2029	2033	I wish you could apologize for other people.
2033	2035	Don't worry about it.
2035	2039	But as long as you've fixed the supper, we may as well eat it.
2048	2053	It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer and warmer in the office.
2067	2069	Well, it stopped raining.
2069	2073	Uh, eating in an office is just... just too officious.
2073	2076	- I have the parlour back here. - All right.
2091	2095	- Sit down. - Oh, thank you.
2098	2101	You're very kind.
2101	2105	It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.
2110	2112	You... You eat like a bird.
2114	2117	And you'd know, of course.
2117	2119	No, not really.
2119	2122	Anyway, I hear the expression "Eats like a bird"...
2123	2127	is really a fal... false... falsity.
2127	2131	Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.
2133	2138	But I really don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things.
2138	2140	You know, taxidermy.
2140	2144	And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...
2144	2147	I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed.
2147	2149	You know, foxes and chimps.
2149	2153	Some people even stuff dogs and cats, but, oh, I can't do that.
2153	2157	I think only birds look well stuffed because...
2157	2160	Well, because they're kind of passive to begin with.
2160	2163	It's a strange hobby. Curious.
2163	2167	- Uncommon too. - Oh, I imagine so.
2167	2171	And it's... it's not as expensive as you'd think. It's cheap, really.
2171	2174	You know, needles and thread, sawdust.
2174	2176	The chemicals are the only thing that, that cost anything.
2176	2179	A man should have a hobby.
2179	2183	Well, it's... it's more than a hobby.
2185	2188	A hobby's supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
2189	2191	Is your time so empty?
2192	2194	No. Uh...
2194	2196	Well, I run the office...
2196	2199	and tend the cabins and grounds...
2199	2202	and do little, uh, errands for my mother...
2202	2205	the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
2205	2208	Do you go out with friends?
2210	2213	Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.
2215	2220	You've never had an empty moment in your entire life, have you?
2222	2226	- Only my share. - Where are you going?
2227	2229	I didn't mean to pry.
2229	2232	I'm looking for a private island.
2234	2237	What are you running away from?
2239	2243	- Why do you ask that? - No.
2243	2245	People never run away from anything.
2248	2252	The rain didn't last long, did it? You know what I think?
2252	2255	I think that...
2256	2259	we're all in our private traps...
2260	2264	clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out.
2266	2268	We scratch and... and claw...
2268	2272	but only at the air, only at each other.
2272	2277	And for all of it, we never budge an inch.
2277	2279	Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
2283	2285	I was born in mine. I don't mind it any more.
2285	2289	Oh, but you should. You should mind it.
2289	2291	Oh, I do, but I say I don't.
2294	2298	You know, if anyone ever talked to me the way I heard...
2298	2302	the way she spoke to you...
2302	2306	Sometimes when she talks to me like that...
2306	2311	I feel I'd like to go up there and curse her and, and leave her forever.
2311	2313	Or at least defy her.
2318	2322	But I know I can't. She's ill.
2322	2326	She sounded strong.
2326	2329	No, I mean... ill.
2330	2334	She had to raise me all by herself, after my father died.
2334	2338	I was only five and it, it must've been quite a strain for her.
2338	2342	I mean, she didn't have to go to work or anything. He left her a little money.
2342	2346	Anyway, a few years ago, Mother met this man.
2347	2350	And he... he talked her into building this motel.
2350	2353	He could have talked her into anything.
2353	2357	And when he died too, it was just too great a shock for her.
2359	2361	And the way he died...
2362	2367	I guess it's nothing to talk about while you're eating.
2367	2372	Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her. She had nothing left.
2372	2374	Except you.
2374	2378	Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.
2380	2382	Why don't you go away?
2382	2384	To a private island, like you?
2388	2391	No... not like me.
2391	2396	I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?
2396	2398	She'd be alone up there.
2400	2403	The fire would go out.
2403	2407	It'd be cold and damp like a grave.
2407	2411	If you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them.
2413	2417	You understand, l... I don't hate her.
2417	2421	I hate what she's become. I hate the illness.
2424	2429	Wouldn't it be better if you put her... some place?
2433	2436	You mean an institution? A madhouse?
2439	2443	People always call a madhouse "some place," don't they?
2444	2446	Put her in "some place."
2447	2450	I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.
2450	2453	What do you know about caring?
2453	2456	Have you ever seen the inside of one of those places?
2456	2460	The laughing and the tears...
2460	2462	and the cruel eyes studying you.
2462	2464	My mother there?
2466	2469	But she's harmless.
2471	2474	She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.
2476	2478	I am sorry.
2478	2482	I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.
2484	2488	- I meant well. - People always mean well.
2488	2491	They cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest...
2491	2493	oh, so very delicately...
2500	2504	Of course, I've suggested it myself.
2504	2509	But I hate to even think about it. She needs me.
2513	2518	It... It's not as if she were a... a maniac, a raving thing.
2518	2521	She...
2521	2524	She just goes a little mad sometimes.
2526	2529	We all go a little mad sometimes.
2531	2533	Haven't you?
2535	2538	Yes.
2538	2543	Sometimes just one time can be enough. Thank you.
2544	2546	Thank you, "Norman."
2546	2549	Norman.
2549	2552	Oh, you're not... you're not going back to your room already?
2553	2555	I'm very tired.
2555	2558	And I have a long drive tomorrow, all the way back to Phoenix.
2558	2560	Really?
2560	2564	I stepped into a private trap back there...
2564	2568	and I'd like to go back and try to pull myself out of it...
2570	2572	bef ore it's too late for me too.
2573	2576	Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay a little while longer?
2576	2580	- I mean, just for talk. - Oh, I'd like to, but...
2580	2582	All right. Well, I'll see you in the morning.
2582	2584	I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?
2584	2587	- What time? - Very early. Dawn.
2587	2590	All right, Miss, uh...
2590	2592	- Crane. - Crane. That's it.
2592	2594	Good night.
2841	2844	Ow! No!
2844	2847	No! Aaah!
2969	2971	Mother! Oh, God, Mother!
2971	2975	Blood! Blood!
3601	3603	I've tried many brands.
3603	3607	So far, of those I've used, I haven't had much luck with any of them.
3607	3610	Let's see what they say about this one.
3610	3612	They tell you what its ingredients are...
3613	3616	and how it's guaranteed to exterminate every insect in the world...
3617	3619	but they do not tell you whether it's painless.
3619	3623	And I say, insect or man, death should always be painless.
3623	3627	This one seems to claim more and better qualities than lots of the others.
3639	3641	Sam?
3641	3644	Sam! Lady wants to see ya.
3650	3653	- Yes, miss? - I'm Marion's sister.
3653	3655	- Oh, sure. Lila. - Is Marion here?
3657	3660	- Well, of course not. Something wrong? -  Thank you.
3664	3666	- She left home on Friday.
3666	3669	I was in Tucson over the weekend and I haven't heard from her since.
3670	3672	Not even a phone call.
3672	3676	If you two are in this together, it's none of my business...
3676	3679	but I want Marion to tell me it's none of my business and then I'll go...
3679	3682	Bob, run out and get yourself some lunch, will ya?
3682	3685	- That's okay. I brought it with me. - Run out and eat it.
3690	3694	Now, what thing could we be in together?
3694	3697	Sorry about the tears.
3697	3700	Well, is Marion in trouble? What is it?
3700	3703	Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?
3707	3708	Who are you, friend?
3709	3711	My name is Arbogast, friend.
3711	3714	I'm a private investigator.
3714	3717	- Where is she, Miss Crane? - I don't know you.
3718	3722	I know you don't, because if you did I wouldn't be able to follow you.
3722	3724	What's your interest in this?
3724	3727	Well, $40,000.
3729	3730	- $40,000? - That's right.
3734	3738	One of you'd better tell me what's going on, and fast. I can take so much...
3738	3740	Now, take it easy, friend.
3740	3744	It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.
3744	3746	What are you talking about? What is this?
3746	3751	She was supposed to bank it on Friday for her boss, and she didn't.
3751	3754	- No one has seen her since. - Someone has seen her.
3754	3757	Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.
3757	3760	They don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back.
3760	3763	- Sam, if she's here... - She isn't. She isn't.
3763	3767	Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come up here on a hunch and nothing more?
3767	3770	Oh, not even a hunch. Just hope.
3770	3774	Well, with a little checking I could get to believe you.
3774	3777	I don't care if you believe me or not.
3777	3780	All I want to do is see Marion bef ore she gets in this too deeply.
3780	3783	Did you check Phoenix? Maybe she had an accident, or a hold-up.
3783	3788	No, she was seen leaving town in her own car... by her employer, I might add.
3788	3791	I can't believe it. Can you?
3792	3795	We're always quickest to doubt people...
3795	3797	who have a reputation for being honest.
3797	3800	I think she's here, Miss Crane.
3800	3802	Where there's a boyfriend...
3802	3807	She's not back there with the nuts and bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.
3807	3810	I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.
3847	3849	- Evening. - Evening.
3849	3851	I almost drove right past.
3851	3854	I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.
3854	3857	Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
3857	3859	- Candy? - No, thanks.
3859	3863	Last two days I've been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon...
3863	3867	but this is the first place that looks like it's hiding from the world.
3867	3870	To tell the truth, I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.
3870	3873	- Just doesn't seem like any use any more. - Oh?
3873	3876	See, that used to be the main highway right there.
3876	3879	- Wanna register? - Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.
3879	3882	- I just wanna ask a few questions. - No trouble. Today's linen day.
3882	3885	I always change the beds once a week whether they've been used or not.
3885	3890	Hate the smell of dampness. It's such a, I don't know... creepy smell.
3891	3893	You out to buy a motel?
3895	3896	No.
3897	3899	Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many the past couple of days...
3899	3901	I thought maybe...
3901	3904	What, uh... What was it you wanted to ask?
3904	3907	I'm looking for a missing person.
3907	3910	My name's Arbogast. I'm a private investigator.
3910	3912	I've been trying to trace a girl...
3912	3916	that's been missing for, oh, about a week now from Phoenix.
3916	3919	It's a private matter. The family wants to forgive her.
3919	3921	She's not in any trouble.
3921	3924	I didn't think the police went looking for people who aren't in trouble.
3924	3926	- I'm not the police. - Oh, yeah.
3926	3931	We have reason to believe she came along this way. Did she stop here?
3931	3934	No one's stopped here for a couple of weeks.
3934	3936	Mind looking at the picture bef ore committing yourself?
3936	3937	Commit myself?
3937	3941	- You sure talk like a policeman. - Look at the picture, please.
3942	3944	- Mm-mmm. Yeah. - Sure?
3945	3947	Well, she may have used an alias.
3947	3949	Marion Crane's her real name...
3949	3953	but she could've registered under a different one.
3953	3957	I tell ya, I don't even much bother with guests registering any more.
3957	3960	One by one, you drop the formalities.
3960	3964	I shouldn't even bother changing the sheets, but old habits die hard.
3964	3966	Which reminds me...
3968	3970	- What's that? - The sign.
3970	3973	A couple last week said if the thing hadn't been on...
3973	3976	they would've thought this was an old, deserted...
3976	3978	You see, that's exactly my point.
3978	3981	Nobody'd been here for a couple weeks...
3981	3985	and there's a couple came by and didn't know that you were open.
3985	3987	As you say, old habits die hard.
3987	3991	This girl could've registered under another name. Mind if I look?
3991	3993	- No. - Thank you.
3995	3997	All right.
3997	4001	I'll get the date somewhere. Mm-hmm.
4001	4004	See, there's nobody.
4004	4007	Let's see, I have a sample of her handwriting here.
4008	4010	Oh, yes.
4010	4012	Here we are.
4012	4014	- Marie Samuels. - Hmm.
4014	4016	That's an interesting alias.
4016	4019	- Is that her? - Yeah, I think so.
4019	4021	Marie, Marion.
4021	4024	- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam. - Mm-hmm.
4024	4029	Mm-hmm. Was she in disguise, by any chance?
4029	4033	- Wanna check the picture again? - I wasn't lying to you.
4033	4036	Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.
4036	4038	It's tough keeping track of the time around here.
4038	4039	I know.
4039	4041	Oh, yeah.
4041	4046	Well, i-i-it was raining and, um, her hair was all wet.
4046	4048	I tell ya, it's not really a very good picture of her.
4048	4050	No, I guess not.
4050	4052	Tell me all about her.
4052	4054	Well, um...
4054	4059	she arrived, um, rather late one night, went straight to sleep...
4059	4061	and, uh, left early the next morning.
4061	4064	- How early? - Oh, ex... very early.
4064	4068	Mm-hmm. Which morning was that?
4068	4070	Uh, the, um...
4070	4073	Th-Th-Th-The next morning.
4073	4075	- Sunday. - I see. Mm-hmm.
4075	4077	- Did anyone meet her here? - No.
4077	4080	- Did she arrive with anyone? - No.
4080	4083	- Did she make any phone calls or... - No.
4083	4085	- Locally? - Uh-uh.
4085	4089	- Did you spend the night with her? - No.
4089	4092	Then how would you know she didn't make any calls?
4095	4097	Uh, w-w...
4097	4099	Well, she was very tired a-and, uh...
4099	4102	See, l... N-Now I'm starting to, um... remember.
4102	4104	l-I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.
4105	4108	- If you make a mental picturization... - Right. Take your time.
4108	4111	Um, she was... she was sitting back there...
4111	4114	N-No, she was standing back there with a sandwich in her hand.
4114	4117	She said she had to go to sleep early...
4117	4121	because she had a long d-d-dr-drive, uh, ahead of her.
4121	4124	- Mm-hmm. Back where? - Back where she came from.
4124	4127	No, you said bef ore she was standing back there...
4127	4129	Yes, b-back in my parlour.
4129	4132	She was very hungry, I made her a sandwich...
4132	4137	and then she said she was tired and she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.
4137	4139	I see. How did she pay you?
4139	4140	- Cash? Cheque? - Cash.
4141	4142	Cash, huh? Mm-hmm.
4143	4147	- After she left, she didn't come back? - Uh-uh. Why should she?
4147	4149	Hmm.
4152	4155	Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh, I guess that's about it.
4155	4159	l-I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.
4159	4162	To tell you the truth, I do mind.
4162	4165	See, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.
4165	4168	It's not coming together. Something's missing.
4168	4172	Well, l-l-I don't know what you c-could expect me to know.
4172	4174	People just come and go, you know.
4174	4176	That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
4176	4178	No.
4178	4184	If I wanted to check the cabins, all twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?
4184	4187	If you don't believe me, come on with me. You can help me change beds.
4187	4189	Oh. No, thanks.
4206	4208	Uh, change your mind?
4210	4212	Oh.
4212	4216	You know, l... I think I have one of those faces you can't help believing.
4216	4218	- Is anyone at home? - No.
4218	4220	Oh? There's somebody sitting in the window.
4221	4223	- N-N-No, there isn't. - Sure. Take a look.
4223	4225	Oh, th-that must be my mother.
4225	4227	She's an, uh, "inavlid..." an invalid.
4227	4230	Uh, it's practically like living alone.
4230	4232	Oh, I see.
4232	4237	If this girl, Marion Crane, were here, you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?
4237	4239	- No. - Not even if she paid you well?
4239	4241	No.
4241	4246	Let's say, for the sake of argument, she wanted you to gallantly protect her.
4246	4248	You'd know you were being used.
4248	4251	- You wouldn't be made a fool of. - I'm not a fool.
4251	4254	And I'm not capable of being fooled, not even by a woman.
4254	4257	- This is not a slur on your manhood. - Let's put it this way.
4257	4260	She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.
4261	4263	Then your mother met her. Could I talk to your mother?
4264	4266	No. As I told you, she's confined.
4266	4269	Just for a few minutes. There might be some hint that you missed out on.
4270	4273	Sick old women are usually pretty sharp.
4273	4275	- I wouldn't disturb her. - Mr Arbogast, l-I think I've...
4275	4278	- I think I've talked to you all I want. - Yes, but just for...
4278	4281	It'd be much better if you left now. Thanks.
4281	4283	Well, all right.
4283	4287	You sure would save me a lot of leg work if you'd let me talk to her.
4287	4290	- Would I need a warrant for that too? - Sure.
4291	4292	All right. Thanks, anyway.
4347	4350	Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?
4350	4353	Let me talk to her, please.
4354	4356	Hello, Lila.
4356	4360	Lila, listen. Marion was up here.
4360	4363	Yes, she spent last Saturday night at the Bates Motel.
4363	4365	It's out on the old highway.
4365	4369	I even know what cabin she was in... it was number one.
4369	4373	Well, this young fella that runs the place said she just spent the night...
4373	4376	left the next day and that was it.
4376	4379	Mmm. Um, no, not exactly.
4381	4383	Well, I did question him, believe me...
4383	4386	but I think I got all there was to get.
4386	4389	I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.
4389	4393	Well, I tell ya, I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...
4393	4396	See, this boy had a sick old mother.
4396	4398	I think she saw Marion and talked to her.
4399	4402	No. No, unf ortunately, he wouldn't let me see her.
4402	4406	Well, I was, but I think I'll go back to the motel first.
4406	4410	No, you stay there with Loomis. I'll be back in about an hour.
4410	4412	All right, fine. Listen, l...
4412	4415	You'll be happy to know what I think.
4415	4419	Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't know that Marion was here.
4421	4424	All right. See ya in about an hour... or less.
4424	4426	All right, bye-bye.
4481	4483	Bates?
4637	4641	Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila?
4643	4646	Sam, he said an hour or less.
4646	4648	Yeah.
4648	4650	It's been three.
4650	4652	Are we just going to sit here and wait?
4652	4654	He'll be back.
4654	4657	Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
4662	4665	- How far is the old highway? - You wanna go out there, don't you?
4665	4668	- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady. - Yes.
4668	4670	- Maybe shake her up. - Yes!
4670	4673	- That wouldn't be wise. - Patience doesn't run in my family.
4673	4675	- I'm going out there. - Arbogast said...
4675	4677	An hour, or less.
4681	4683	- Well, I'm going.
4683	4685	You'll never find it.
4688	4690	- Stay here. - Why can't I go?
4690	4694	I don't know. One of us has to be here, in case he's on the way.
4694	4697	What am I supposed to do, just sit here and wait?
4697	4698	Yeah. Stay here.
4719	4721	Arbogast?
4722	4724	Arbogast!
4727	4728	Arbogast!
4758	4760	- He didn't come back here? - Sam!
4760	4764	No Arbogast, no Bates. Only the old lady at home.
4764	4767	Sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
4767	4769	Where could he have gone?
4769	4771	Maybe he got some definite lead.
4771	4773	- Maybe he went right on. - Without calling me?
4773	4775	- In a hurry. - Sam, he called...
4775	4777	when he had nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.
4777	4781	Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything at all?
4781	4783	Yes, I think he would've.
4783	4785	- Let's go see Al Chambers. - Who's he?
4786	4789	- Our deputy sheriff around here. - Let me get my coat.
4797	4799	Good evening.
4799	4803	Well, l... I don't know where to start, except at the beginning.
4803	4805	Yes.
4805	4808	- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix. - How do you do?
4808	4811	She's been here searching for her sister.
4811	4813	There's this private detective helping.
4813	4816	We got a call from this detective... he'd traced her...
4816	4818	to that motel on the old highway.
4818	4820	That must be the Bates Motel.
4820	4823	He called to say he was going to question Mrs Bates.
4823	4825	Norman took a wife?
4825	4829	No, l-I don't think so. An old woman. His mother.
4829	4832	That was early this evening. We haven't seen or heard from him since.
4832	4835	Now, your sister's missing how long?
4836	4839	She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday without a trace.
4839	4842	How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
4842	4844	They thought she'd be coming to me.
4845	4847	- Left Phoenix under her own steam? - Yes.
4847	4849	She's not missing so much as she's run away.
4849	4851	That's right.
4851	4853	From what?
4855	4857	She stole some money.
4857	4859	A lot?
4859	4861	Forty thousand dollars.
4861	4863	The police haven't been able to...
4863	4867	Everyone concerned thought if they could get her to give the money back...
4867	4870	they could avoid involving her with the police.
4870	4872	That explains the private detective.
4872	4874	He traced her to the Bates place.
4874	4877	What exactly did he say when he called you?
4877	4880	He said Marion was there for one night, then she left.
4880	4882	- With the $40,000? - He didn't say anything...
4882	4885	about the money.
4885	4887	It isn't important what he said, is it?
4887	4891	He was supposed to come talk to us after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.
4891	4893	That's what I want you to do something about.
4893	4894	Like what?
4894	4897	I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.
4897	4901	I'm sure there's something wrong out there, and I have to know what.
4901	4905	Well, I think there's something wrong too, Miss, but not the same thing.
4905	4908	I think what's wrong is your private detective.
4908	4912	I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was goin'...
4912	4914	probably from Norman Bates...
4914	4917	and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
4917	4922	No, no, he said he was dissatisfied and he was going back there.
4922	4924	Call Norman and let him say what happened.
4924	4926	At this hour?
4927	4930	He was out when I was there a while ago. If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.
4930	4935	He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin' the door in the dead of night like some people do.
4935	4938	This fellow lives like a hermit.
4938	4941	You must remember that bad business out there about ten years ago.
4941	4943	Please. Call.
4949	4953	Florrie, the sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel.
4959	4962	Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
4962	4965	Ye... I been just fine, thanks.
4965	4968	Listen, we got worries here.
4968	4971	Yeah, have you had a fella stop by there tonight...
4973	4975	Well, this one wouldn't be a customer.
4975	4978	- A private detective, name of... - Arbogast.
4978	4980	Arbogast.
4983	4985	And after he left?
4987	4989	No, that's... that's okay, Norman.
4992	4995	This detective was there, Norman told him about the girl...
4995	4998	the detective thanked him and he went away.
4998	5001	And he didn't come back? He didn't see the mother?
5002	5004	Your detective told you he couldn't come right back...
5005	5008	because he was going to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
5008	5010	Yes.
5010	5013	Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried...
5013	5017	in Greenlawn Cemetery for the past ten years.
5017	5021	I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
5021	5023	'Tain't only local history, Sam.
5023	5027	It's the only case of murder and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.
5027	5031	Mrs Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with...
5031	5033	when she found out he was married...
5033	5036	then took a helpin' of the same stuff herself.
5037	5040	Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
5040	5043	Norman found them dead together.
5043	5046	In bed.
5046	5048	You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Bates' mother?
5049	5053	Now, wait a minute, Sam. Are you sure you saw an old woman?
5053	5056	Yes! In the house behind the motel!
5056	5058	I called and pounded but she just ignored me!
5058	5060	You saw Norman Bates' mother?
5060	5064	But it had to be... because Arbogast said so too!
5064	5068	And the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was too ill.
5068	5072	Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates...
5072	5076	who's that woman buried out in Greenlawn Cemetery?
5118	5122	Now, Mother, um... l-I'm gonna bring something up...
5122	5125	I am sorry, boy...
5125	5129	but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders.
5129	5131	Please, Mother.
5131	5134	No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.
5134	5137	Ha! You think I'm fruity, huh?
5137	5139	I'm staying right here.
5139	5142	This is my room and no one will drag me out of it...
5142	5145	least of all my big, bold son.
5145	5147	They'll come now, Mother.
5147	5151	He came after the girl, and now someone will come after him.
5151	5155	Mother, please, it's just for a few days so they won't find you.
5155	5157	Just for a few days?
5157	5161	In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!
5161	5165	You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again, not ever again!
5165	5168	Now get out!
5168	5172	- I told you to get out, boy. - I'll carry you, Mother.
5172	5175	Norman, what do you think you're doing?
5175	5178	Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!
5183	5187	Put me down! Put me down! I can walk on my own.
5192	5194	Wonderful sermon today.
5194	5196	- Good morning. -  Good morning.
5197	5199	We thought we'd drive out to that motel with you.
5199	5201	- He's already been. - Went out bef ore service.
5201	5204	- Did you two have breakfast? - Didn't find anything?
5204	5208	Nothing. Let's clear the way here.
5208	5210	What did he say about my sister?
5210	5213	Just what he told your detective: She used a fake name.
5213	5218	Saw the register myself. Saw the whole place. That boy's alone there.
5218	5221	- No mother? - You must have seen an illusion, Sam.
5221	5223	I know you're not the seein'-illusions type...
5223	5226	but no woman was there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is.
5226	5228	I still feel there's something...
5228	5232	Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.
5232	5236	Come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person and a theft.
5236	5239	The sooner you drop this in the lap of the law...
5239	5243	that's the sooner you stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up.
5243	5245	How 'bout that?
5245	5248	- I don't know. - It's Sunday.
5248	5252	Come to the house and do your reporting around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.
5252	5254	You too, Sam.
5254	5257	Thank you.
5257	5262	- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type. - No, you're not.
5262	5266	- You want me to drop you at the hotel... - Sam.
5266	5270	I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.
5270	5274	Neither will I. Come on.
5274	5278	We better decide what we're gonna say or do when we walk in there.
5278	5280	We're going to register as man and wife.
5280	5283	We're going to get shown to a cabin...
5283	5287	and then we're going to search every inch of the place, inside and out.
5310	5313	I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting.
5313	5315	Someone's at that window. I just saw the curtain move.
5315	5316	Come on.
5320	5322	- Well? - Just coming up to ring for you.
5322	5324	Uh-huh. Suppose you want a room.
5324	5327	We were gonna try to make it to San Francisco...
5327	5329	but we don't like the look of that sky.
5329	5332	Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
5339	5342	- I'll take you to cabin ten. - Better sign in first, hadn't we?
5342	5344	That's not necessary.
5344	5347	My boss is paying for this trip and, uh, well, it's 90%business.
5347	5350	He wants practically notarized receipts.
5350	5353	I'd better sign in and get a receipt.
5371	5373	Thank you.
5375	5377	- I'll get your bags. - Haven't any.
5381	5384	- I'll show you the room, then. - First time I've ever seen it happen.
5384	5386	You check in any other place in this country without bags...
5386	5390	- and you have to pay in advance. - Ten dollars.
5396	5399	That receipt.
5404	5406	I'll go on ahead.
5411	5414	All right, there's your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.
5414	5417	Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.
5435	5438	Sam, we have to go into that cabin and search it...
5438	5441	no matter what we're afraid of finding or how much it may hurt.
5441	5443	I know.
5443	5445	Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
5445	5447	I don't know, but if you had...
5447	5450	a useless business like this motel, what would you need to get out?
5450	5454	To get a new business somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?
5457	5459	How could we prove that...
5459	5462	If he opens a motel on the new highway in, say, a year...
5462	5464	There must be some proof that exists now...
5464	5467	something that proves he got that money away from Marion somehow.
5467	5472	- What makes you sound so certain? - Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.
5472	5474	Or he felt sorry for me and he was beginning to feel...
5474	5476	the same way about you.
5476	5479	I could tell the last time I talked to him on the phone.
5479	5481	He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us...
5481	5483	unless he was stopped.
5483	5487	And he was stopped. So he must have found out something.
5489	5492	We'll start with cabin one.
5493	5497	If he sees us, we're just taking the air.
5529	5530	Bates.
5579	5581	No shower curtain.
5581	5584	- Sam! Look! - Huh? What is it?
5584	5586	It's figuring. It didn't get washed down. Look.
5586	5590	Some figure has been added to or subtracted from 40,000.
5590	5592	That proves Marion was here. It'd be too wild a coincidence...
5593	5594	Bates never denied she was here.
5595	5598	Oh. Doesn't that prove he found out about the money?
5598	5600	Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
5600	5604	But that old woman, whoever she is, she told Arbogast something.
5604	5607	I want her to tell us the same thing.
5607	5610	- You can't go up there. - Why not?
5610	5612	- Bates. - Well, let's find him.
5612	5615	One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the old woman.
5615	5618	You'll never be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held.
5618	5621	I don't like you going into that house alone.
5621	5623	I can handle a sick old woman.
5623	5626	All right, I'll find Bates and keep him occupied.
5627	5629	Wait a minute.
5629	5633	If you get anything out of the mother...
5633	5635	can you find your way back to town?
5635	5637	Yes, of course.
5637	5641	If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.
5663	5666	- You looking for me? - Why, yes, as a matter of fact.
5666	5668	Wife's taking a nap and...
5668	5672	I never can keep quiet enough for her, so I thought I'd look you up and talk.
5672	5676	- Good. You satisfied with your cabin? - Oh, it's fine.
5749	5752	I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
5752	5754	I thought it was the people who were alone most of the time...
5754	5757	who did all the talking when they got the chance.
5757	5759	Here you are doing all the listening.
5759	5762	- You are alone here, aren't you? - Mm-hmm.
5762	5764	Drive me crazy.
5764	5767	I think that would be a rather extreme reaction, don't you?
5767	5772	Just an expression. What I meant was, uh, I'd do anything to get away.
5773	5775	- Wouldn't you? - No.
5779	5782	- Mrs Bates?
5859	5861	I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here...
5861	5863	I'm just doubting that you are.
5863	5867	I think if you saw a chance to get out from under you'd unload this place.
5867	5871	This place? This place happens to be my only world.
5871	5874	I grew up in that house. I had a very happy childhood.
5874	5877	My mother and I were more than happy.
5938	5941	You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
5941	5943	I don't know what you've been saying.
5943	5946	I've been talking about your mother, about your motel.
5946	5948	- How you gonna do it? - Do what?
5948	5951	Buy a new one in a new town where you won't have to hide your mother.
5951	5954	Why don't you just get in your car and drive away?
5954	5958	Where will you get the money to do that? Or do you already have it socked away?
5958	5961	- Shut up! - A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.
5965	5968	I bet your mother knows where the money is and what you did to get it.
5968	5972	I think she'll tell us.
5972	5976	Where's that girl you came here with? Where is she?
6041	6043	Mrs Bates, it's...
6062	6067	Norman Bates!
6095	6098	If anyone gets any answers it'll be the psychiatrist.
6099	6101	Even I couldn't get to Norman and he knows me.
6101	6103	- You warm enough, miss? - Yes.
6105	6107	Did he talk to you?
6107	6110	No.
6110	6115	I got the whole story, but not from Norman. I got it from his "mother."
6117	6120	Norman Bates no longer exists.
6120	6123	He only half-existed to begin with.
6123	6127	And now the other half has taken over...
6127	6130	probably for all time.
6132	6134	Did he kill my sister?
6134	6137	Yes... and no.
6137	6140	Now look, if you're trying to lay some psychiatric groundwork...
6140	6143	for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop...
6143	6146	A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.
6146	6148	He merely tries to explain it.
6148	6151	- But my sister is... - Yes.
6154	6158	Yes, I'm sorry. The private investigator too.
6158	6162	If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...
6166	6169	Uh, have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?
6169	6172	- Yes, two. - Young girls?
6173	6176	- Did he confess to... - Like I said...
6176	6178	the "mother."
6179	6183	To understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the "mother"...
6183	6187	that is from the "mother" half of Norman's mind...
6187	6190	you have to go back ten years...
6190	6193	to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.
6193	6198	He was already dangerously disturbed, had been since his father died.
6199	6204	His mother was a clinging, demanding woman...
6204	6208	and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world.
6210	6212	Then she met a man...
6212	6217	and it seemed to Norman that she threw him over for this man.
6217	6220	That pushed him over the line and he killed them both.
6220	6224	Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all...
6226	6230	most unbearable to the son who commits it.
6230	6236	So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.
6238	6240	He stole her corpse.
6242	6245	A weighted coffin was buried.
6245	6248	He hid the body in the fruit cellar...
6248	6251	even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep.
6252	6254	And that still wasn't enough.
6254	6258	She was there... but she was a corpse.
6261	6263	So he began to think and speak for her...
6264	6267	give her half his life, so to speak.
6267	6271	At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations.
6271	6276	At other times, the "mother" half took over completely.
6276	6280	He was never all Norman, but he was often only "Mother"...
6282	6286	and because he was so pathologically jealous of her...
6286	6288	he assumed that she was as jealous of him.
6288	6294	Theref ore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman...
6294	6298	the "mother" side of him would go wild.
6300	6303	When he met your sister...
6303	6306	he was touched by her, aroused by her.
6306	6308	He wanted her.
6308	6312	That set off the jealous "mother" and "Mother" killed the girl.
6315	6319	After the murder Norman returned as if from a deep sleep...
6319	6323	and, like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime...
6323	6326	he was convinced his "mother" had committed!
6326	6328	Why was he... dressed like that?
6328	6331	He's a transvestite.
6331	6334	Uh, not exactly.
6334	6337	A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change...
6338	6340	or satisf action, is a transvestite.
6340	6344	But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible...
6344	6347	to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive.
6349	6352	And when reality came to close...
6352	6355	when danger or desire threatened that illusion...
6358	6361	he dressed up, even to a cheap wig he bought.
6361	6365	He'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice.
6365	6367	He tried to be his mother.
6369	6372	And, uh, now he is.
6372	6377	That's what I meant when I said I got the story from the "mother."
6377	6381	You see, when the mind houses two personalities...
6381	6385	there's always a conflict, a battle.
6385	6388	In Norman's case, the battle is over...
6389	6391	and the dominant personality has won.
6391	6395	And the $40,000? Who got that?
6395	6399	The swamp. These were crimes of passion, not profit.
6400	6403	He feels a little chill. Can I bring him this blanket?
6404	6406	- Oh, sure. - All right.
6419	6421	Thank you.
6428	6431	It's sad when a mother has to speak the words...
6431	6433	that condemn her own son...
6433	6437	but I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.
6437	6442	They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago.
6442	6445	He was always bad, and in the end...
6445	6449	he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that man...
6449	6453	as if I could do anything except sit and stare...
6453	6456	like one of his stuffed birds.
6456	6460	They know I can't even move a finger, and I won't.
6460	6465	I'll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do suspect me.
6468	6472	They're probably watching me. Well, let them.
6472	6476	Let them see what kind of a person I am.
6476	6478	I'm not even gonna swat that fly.
6479	6482	I hope they are watching. They'll see.
6482	6484	They'll see and they'll know...
6484	6490	and they'll say, "Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
