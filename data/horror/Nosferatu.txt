95	101	A chronicle of the Great Death of Wisborg in the year 1843 A.D.
104	110	Nosferatu! Doesn't this name sound like the very midnight call of Death?
116	126	I have long meditated on the rise and fall of the Great Death in my home town of Wisborg.
126	137	Here is the story: In Wisborg there lived a man called Hutter with his young wife Ellen...
218	221	"Why have you destroyed them - the beautiful flowers?"
239	248	"Not so hasty, my young friend! No one escapes his destiny."
259	266	There was also a house agent called Knock, a strange man, and the center of mush gossip. One thing was sure: he paid his people well.
315	323	"Count Orlok - His Grace - from Transylvania - wants to buy a beautiful house - in our little town..."
327	335	"You could make a nice bit of money."
339	348	"You will have a marvellous jorney - What matter if it costs you a bit of pain - or even a little blood?"
401	404	"He wants a handsome deserted house..."
413	418	"That's house - just opposite yours. Offer him that!"
421	430	"Leave at once, my young friend. Have a quick journey into the land of phantoms!"
449	457	"I may be away for several month, dear Ellen, away in a country of ghosts and robbers."
509	517	Thus Hutter gave the grief-stricken woman into the care of his friends, the rich shipbuilder Harding and Ruth, his sister.
537	542	"Do not fear."
669	675	"My dinner - quickly - I must hasten to Count Orlok's castle!"
709	715	"You must leave now! The evil spirits become all-powerful after dark!"
818	823	The Book of the Vampires
830	835	From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which liberty and feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth,
835	841	unredeemed, in horrible Darkness, on the cursed earth from the grabeyards of the Black Death.
841	848	Nosferatu, a name that ringeth like the cry of a bird of prey. Speak it not aloud!
912	920	Men do not always recognize the dangers that beasts can sense at certain times.
989	992	"Drive on! The sun is setting!"
1029	1033	"We will go no further! Not for a fortune!"
1043	1047	"We will go no further! Here begins the land of the phantoms!"
1074	1082	And when he had crossed the bridge, the phantoms came to meet him.
1263	1271	"You are late, young man. It is almost midnight. My servants have all retired."
1348	1351	"Blood! Your precious blood!"
1381	1389	"Shall we stay up together for awhile? It is a long time until sunrise during the day, my friend, I truly sleep the deepest sleep."
1407	1414	As soon as the sun rose Hutter felt himself freed from the shadows of the night.
1553	1556	Dearest Ellen! Do not grieve because your beloved is far away...
1567	1575	...the mosquitoes are reals pests. I have been stung at the neck by two at once, very close together, one on each side...
1583	1587	One's dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...
1631	1635	With twilight the empty castle came alive again with menacing shadows.
1674	1677	"Your wife has a beautiful neck..."
1688	1696	"I shall take the house - the handsome deserted house opposite yours..."
1729	1733	From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which libeth and feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth,
1734	1742	unredeemed, in horrorible Darkness, on the cursed earth from the grabeyards of the Black Death.
1748	1757	At night said Nosferatu sinketh his fangs into victim and feeds on the blood that constitues his hellish elixir of life.
1862	1865	At the same hour...
1890	1891	"Ellen!"
1899	1902	"Fetch a doctor...a doctor!"
1932	1935	"Thomas! Thomas! Hear me!"
2002	2004	"A harmless blood condition!"
2008	2015	The doctor described Ellen's anxietes as if the had been trifles. But I know that in that night her soul had heard the call of death.
2016	2020	Already, Nosferatu was raising his wings. And Hutter, far away, had heard her cry of warning.
2180	2182	"Ellen! Ellen!"
2237	2245	The raftsmen little suspected what terrible cargo they carried down the valley.
2261	2269	"The peasants brought him into the hospital yesterday. They said he fell from a mountain. He is still feverish."
2282	2286	"Coffins...Coffins filled with earth."
2376	2380	Nosferatu was on the way, and with him catastrophe approached Wisborg.
2381	2391	At the same time the Paracelsian Professor Bulwer was giving a course on the secrets of nature and their strange correspondance to human life.
2393	2397	The professor told his students about the existence of a carnivorous plant...
2439	2446	"Astonishing, isn't it a gentlemen? That plan is the vampire of the vegetable kingdom."
2449	2454	Already, Nosferatus's drawing near semmed to affect Knock, the house agent.
2464	2468	"The patient who was brought in yesterday has gone out of his mind!"
2501	2504	"Blood is life! Blood is life!!!!"
2539	2543	"And this one..."
2548	2551	"...a polyp with tentacles..."
2562	2566	"Transparent - almost without substance..."
2567	2571	"No more than a phantom..."
2588	2592	"Spiders-"
2621	2629	Ellen was often seen alone among the dunes. Longing for her beloved, she searched the waves and the distant horizon.
2686	2692	One's dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...
2693	2699	I am leaving immediately to return to Wisborg - and to you.
2732	2736	"No I have to get away - reach home by the shortest possible way!"
2801	2804	New Plague Baffles Science
2862	2868	"A sailor has fallen ill below deck. He is talking in a fever."
2954	2966	Like an epidemic it spread over the entire ship. The first sailor who had shown the symptoms was followed by the entire crew into the dark grave of the waters.
2966	2978	In the light of the setting sun the captain and his first mate said farewell to the last of their companions.
3005	3011	"I shall go down! If I haven't come up again within ten minutes..."
3097	3101	The ship of death had a new captain
3127	3136	It is a difficult to imagine how young Hutter, his energies sadly dectimated, managed to surmoung the difficulties of his homeward journey.
3137	3145	At the same time, driven by the fatal breath of the vampire, the vessel moved rapidly toward the Baltic.
3328	3332	The Master is coming! The Master is here!"
3403	3410	I have given much thought to the notion that Nosferatu travelled with coffins filled with earth.
3410	3418	Then I discovered that vampires draw their shadowy power from the cursed ground in wich they are buried.
3657	3661	"I have examined everything - there is no living soul on board."
3719	3728	Varna-July 12. Crew, apart from myself, the captain-one helmsman, one mate, and five sailors. Departing for the Dardanellas.
3791	3797	2nd day: July 13. One sailor has contracted a fever. Course: SSW. Direction of wind:
3797	3804	3nd day: July 14. Mate has begun to hallicunate, says a strange passenger is below deck. Course:SE. Direction of wind: NE. Volume of wind:3.6
3814	3822	10th day: 22 July. Passed Gibraltar - Panic on board - Three men dead already - mate out of his mind - Rats in the hold - I fear the plague...
3830	3833	"The plague is upon us! Go home! Shut all your windows and doors!"
3883	3888	All citizens are notified that the honourable magistrate of this town prohibits the moving of plague-victims
3888	3893	into hospitals to prevent the plague from spreading through the streets.
3973	3978	Hutter had made Ellen promise not to touch the book which had given him such terrifying hallucinations.
3978	3983	Yet she way unable to withstand its strange fascination.
3999	4004	The Book of the Vampires
4005	4014	One can recognize that mark of the vampire by the trace of his fangs on the victim's throat.
4036	4041	"Look! Every night, in front of me..."
4118	4123	Panic seized the people. Who was sick or dying? Who would be stricken tomorrow?
4135	4139	"I shall run over there quickly. I shall get Sievers..."
4210	4214	Wherefore there is no salvation therefrom except that a woman pure in heart were to make the vampire forget the cock's first crowing.
4214	4219	Of her own free will would she have to give him her blood.
4229	4232	The panic-stricken town was looking for a scape-goat. It chose Knock.
4243	4246	"They saw him escape - he strangled his keeper!"
4256	4259	"He strangled him! The vampire!"
4531	4534	"Bulwer! Fetch Bulwer!"
4686	4689	"Master! Master! Beware!"
4763	4765	"The master...is...dead."
4792	4794	"Thomas!"
4817	4821	And the miracle shall be told in truth. At that very hour the Great Death ceased and
4821	4827	the shadow of the empire vanished as if overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun.
4834	4839	The End
