144	147	What's your name again? - Chrissy.
147	150	Where are we goin'? - Swimming.
152	155	Slow up. Slow down some.
156	159	I'm not drunk. Slow down.
160	162	Wait. I'm coming.
163	165	I'm coming.
166	168	I'm definitely coming.
169	171	Hold on.
179	181	I can swim.
182	185	I just can't walk or undress myself.
204	205	Come on in the water.
205	208	Take it easy. Take it easy.
252	253	Help me.
253	255	I'm coming. I'm coming.
258	260	It hurts.
265	267	Oh, my God.
276	278	Please help.
307	310	How come the sun didn't use to shine in here?
313	317	We bought the house in the fall, and this is summer.
320	322	Somebody feed the dogs.
323	325	Right.
328	330	Do you see the kids?
335	337	They must be in the backyard.
337	339	In Amity you say 'yard.'
341	345	They're in the 'yard', not too 'far' from the 'car.'
347	350	How's that? - Like you're from New York.
351	354	Mom, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.
354	357	You were playin' on those swings, weren't you?
357	361	Those swings are dangerous. Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.
361	362	I think you're gonna live.
362	365	It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen. - Hello.
365	367	Yes. - Can I go swimmin'?
367	369	Let me clean this thing off first.
369	373	What do they usually do? Wash up or float up? Or what?
376	379	Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...
381	386	...15, 20 minutes. All right? - Dry you off. Go on, get a Band-Aid.
386	388	Got to go. Missing person.
388	392	Season hasn't started. Nobody's even here yet.
395	397	Listen, Chief...
397	399	...be careful, will ya? - In this town?
399	400	Hi, Dad.
401	403	Wait a minute. Let me get on.
403	406	I want my cup back. - You'll get it.
407	409	Wave goodbye. Bye.
438	440	Nobody saw her go into the water?
440	443	Somebody could've. I was sort of passed out.
444	447	You mean, she ran out on you? - No, sir.
449	451	She must've drowned.
451	453	Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?
454	456	You live here? - No. Hartford.
456	459	I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.
459	461	Your folks were born here, right? - I'm an Islander.
461	463	They moved off when my dad retired.
463	465	You an Islander? - No. New York City.
465	467	You here for the summer?
467	469	Come on.
481	483	Hold it.
494	496	Oh, Jesus.
520	523	You're up awful early. Is the Chief in there?
525	529	Chief, what have you got on? - Lf this new filing system is to work...
529	532	...you must keep that old stuff off my desk. Just the pending.
533	536	Yes, Chief. We got a bunch of calls about the Karate school.
536	539	It seems that the 9-year-olds from the school have been...
539	542	...karate-ing the picket fences.
542	546	Chief Brody's office. The Medical Inspector.
557	560	The Fire Chief wants you to go over...
560	563	I want a list of the water activities that the city fathers...
563	565	...are planning for today.
565	566	Hendricks.
566	568	Where do we keep the 'Beach Closed' signs?
568	570	We never had any.
570	573	There's a truck with New Hampshire plates in front of my store.
574	578	Just have him fill out the form. Just fill it out.
598	601	Look what the kids did to my fence. Eight and nine-year-olds...
601	603	Glasses? - Yeah, glasses.
604	608	I'll call you later in the afternoon. I promise.
612	614	This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.
614	617	The summer ginks come down here in June.
617	620	You haven't got one thing on here I ordered.
620	624	Not a beach umbrella, not a sun lounger, no beach balls.
624	626	If I can't get service...
633	635	Polly sent me to tell you that there's a bunch...
635	639	...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay, doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.
639	641	I couldn't call them in, there's no phones out there.
642	643	Come on, get out of there.
643	646	Take this stuff back to the office and work on those signs.
646	649	'Beaches Closed. No Swimming. By order of the Amity P.D.'
650	651	Let Polly do the printing.
651	655	What's the matter with my printing? - Let Polly do the printing.
655	657	Chief Brody.
659	661	What have you got there?
661	664	We had a shark attack at South Beach this morning, Mayor.
664	666	Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.
666	669	Albert, come on, you kook. Keep your arms up.
675	679	Charlie, take me out to those kids, will ya?
701	704	You're gonna shut down the beaches on your own authority?
704	707	What other authority do I need? - You need a civic ordinance...
707	710	...or a resolution by the board. - That's going by the book.
710	714	We're really a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here.
714	716	This is your first summer, you know.
716	718	What does that mean?
718	722	I'm only trying to say that Amity is a summer town.
722	724	We need summer dollars.
724	728	If they can't swim here, they'll be glad to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...
728	730	...the Hamptons, Long Island.
730	732	That doesn't mean we serve them a smorgasbord.
732	735	But we've never had that kind of trouble in these waters.
735	738	What else could've done that? A boat propeller?
738	741	I think possibly yes, a boating accident.
741	743	That's not what you told me over the phone.
743	746	I was wrong. We'll have to amend our reports.
747	750	And you'll stand by that? - I'll stand by that.
751	754	A summer girl goes swimming, swims out a little far.
754	757	She tires, fishing boat comes along... - It's happened before.
758	761	I don't think you appreciate the reaction people have to these things.
761	765	I appreciate it. I'm just reacting to what I was told.
765	767	It's all psychological.
767	771	You yell 'Barracuda.' and everybody says, 'What?'
773	775	You yell, 'Shark.'...
776	780	...we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.
780	783	Okay. You can take us back now.
795	797	I'm gonna get my raft and go back out in the water.
797	799	Let me see your fingers.
800	804	Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune. - Just let me go out a little longer.
804	807	Just 10 more minutes. - Thanks.
813	814	All I want to know...
815	818	I just want to know one simple thing: When do I get to become an Islander?
818	820	Ellen, never. Never.
820	825	You're not born here, you're not an Islander. That's it.
878	881	Don't bother him. Come right back.
884	886	I know you got a lot of problems downtown...
886	889	...but I've got a couple of problems I wish you'd take care of.
889	895	One, I've got some cats parking in front of the house, I can't get...
896	900	What I need is a red zone. It's simple, you could take care of it.
900	903	Would you come here a minute, please?
906	908	Are you okay?
908	910	Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
910	913	Look, if the kids goin' in the water is worrying you...
913	915	...they can play out here on the beach.
916	918	It's all right. Let them go.
927	929	It's cold.
929	934	We know all about you, Chief. You don't go in the water at all, do you?
934	937	That's some bad hat, Harry.
941	944	Chief Brody, you are uptight.
945	948	Come on. That's it.
961	962	Tippet. Tippet.
991	993	Did you see that?
1001	1003	Blood.
1007	1009	Everybody out.
1011	1013	Get them out.
1019	1021	Michael, get out of the water.
1033	1035	Alex.
1053	1055	We don't even know if there's a shark around here.
1056	1059	I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.
1059	1062	I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner. This is turning into a contest.
1062	1066	It's not just the Gazette. She's advertising in out of town papers.
1066	1070	I suggest we move to council chambers where we'll have more room.
1070	1072	I'm responsible for public safety here.
1072	1075	Then go out tomorrow and see that no one gets hurt.
1075	1077	It's a small story. I'll bury it as deep as I can.
1078	1081	The ad is gonna run on the back along with the grocery ads.
1081	1083	Right in here, please.
1085	1087	Move on in, please.
1100	1102	Why do you insist on playing the heavy?
1102	1107	I have a point of view and it speaks for many of the people here.
1109	1112	Not only me, because I have the motel. How do you feel about it?
1112	1114	Let's have some order.
1116	1118	Let's have some order, please.
1119	1121	Any special questions?
1121	1125	Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?
1126	1130	I don't think that's funny. I don't think that's funny at all.
1130	1132	All right, all right.
1132	1137	That's private business between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
1137	1140	Martin, would you please...
1140	1142	Chief Brody.
1144	1147	I just want to tell you what we're planning so far.
1147	1148	What about the beaches, Chief?
1149	1153	We're gonna put on the extra summer deputies as soon as possible.
1153	1156	And then we're gonna try and use shark spotters on the beach.
1156	1159	Are you going to close the beaches?
1162	1164	Yes, we are.
1165	1170	We're also bringing in some experts from the Oceanographic Institute.
1170	1172	Only 24 hours.
1173	1174	I didn't agree to that.
1176	1178	Only 24 hours.
1178	1180	24 hours is like three weeks.
1203	1207	You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.
1208	1213	I'll catch this bird for you. It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.
1213	1218	Not like goin' down to the pond and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.
1218	1220	This shark, swallow you whole.
1221	1225	Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.
1226	1228	And we got to do it quick.
1228	1233	Got to bring back the tourists that'll put your businesses on a payin' basis.
1233	1235	But it's not gonna be pleasant.
1235	1238	I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.
1239	1244	I'll find him for $3,000, but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.
1244	1246	You got to make up your minds.
1246	1248	Gonna stay alive and ante up...
1248	1253	...gonna play it cheap and be on welfare the whole winter.
1253	1255	I don't want no volunteers. I don't want no mates.
1256	1259	There's too many captains on this island.
1259	1261	$10,000, for me, by myself.
1262	1267	For that, you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.
1270	1273	Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.
1274	1276	We'll take it under advisement.
1279	1282	Mr. Mayor, Chief...
1284	1286	...ladies and gentlemen.
1318	1320	Oh, God, you scared me.
1325	1328	People don't even know how old sharks are.
1328	1331	If they live 2,000, 3,000 years they don't know.
1331	1334	Enough. You're not going to be able to go to sleep tonight.
1334	1336	Here. Come on.
1338	1340	Thanks.
1348	1350	Want to get drunk and fool around?
1350	1352	Oh, yeah.
1355	1358	Mikey really loves his present.
1359	1360	Where is he?
1360	1362	Sitting in it.
1364	1366	Good God.
1369	1372	All right, Michael, out of the boat.
1372	1376	Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.
1376	1377	I'm helpin' Michael.
1377	1379	Get out of that boat. - Hi, Dad.
1379	1381	Just a little longer. Please?
1381	1384	It's his birthday tomorrow. - I don't want him on the ocean.
1384	1387	He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat. He's not gonna go in the water.
1387	1393	I don't think he'll go in the water again, after what happened yesterday.
1393	1395	Now don't say that.
1395	1399	I don't want that to happen, you know that.
1399	1402	I want him to read the boating regulations, the rules...
1402	1405	...before he goes out on his own.
1405	1409	Michael, did you hear your father? Out of the water now.
1417	1421	I'm tired. Let's stop before someone reports us.
1421	1424	The chief lives on the other side of the island.
1424	1426	Am I comin' in straight?
1427	1429	Just keep rowin'.
1437	1441	We better catch something, this is my wife's holiday roast.
1441	1445	Don't worry about it. $3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.
1451	1455	Come and get it.
1458	1460	The tide's takin' it right out.
1463	1465	Can't we go home?
1522	1524	He's takin' it.
1525	1527	Go, go, go.
1555	1561	Charlie, take my word for it. Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.
1562	1566	Come on, Charlie, swim to me. Keep comin'.
1571	1575	I can't get up. - Give me your hand, Charlie.
1576	1579	Help me. - Get your feet out of the water.
1592	1594	Can we go home now?
1603	1606	So then Denherder and Charlie sat there tryin' to catch their breath...
1606	1610	...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
1611	1613	That's not funny. That's not funny at all.
1613	1616	Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
1616	1619	Looks more like The National Enquirer.
1620	1625	All right, hold it, hold it. Hold everything. I said, hold it.
1629	1633	Hello. - Hello, back, young feller. How are you?
1633	1638	Say, I hope you're not goin' out with those nuts, are you?
1641	1642	The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.
1642	1646	You have to move out, or he can't get out at all.
1646	1650	Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it. You got a paddle on the boat?
1650	1653	Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.
1655	1657	How many guys are you gonna put in that boat?
1657	1659	Whatever's safe, right?
1659	1663	Yeah, well that ain't safe. - Watch it, that's dynamite.
1663	1667	Where are you goin' with that? - I'm goin' on the boat.
1667	1671	Help me get those guys out of the boat. - Sure.
1671	1676	Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat.
1676	1678	Go on, get out of here.
1678	1681	You ain't going. What do you care? - Can you tell me...
1681	1683	...if there's a good restaurant or hotel here?
1683	1686	Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
1686	1688	They're all gonna die.
1688	1691	Listen to me. We've got some road block signs outside.
1691	1694	You've got to get somebody to help us.
1694	1696	Yeah, get those road block signs out on the highway.
1696	1700	Because we've got more people down here than we can handle.
1700	1703	What are you doing? These are your people. Go talk to them.
1703	1705	They aren't mine. They're from all over.
1705	1708	You see the plates in the parking lot? Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...
1708	1712	I'm all by myself out there. What happened to the extra help?
1712	1714	That's not until the Fourth of July.
1714	1717	You know those guys in that fan-tail launch out there?
1717	1719	None of them will get out of the harbor alive.
1719	1722	That's what I'm saying. You know their names. Talk to those clowns.
1723	1727	Everyone seems to be having a good time. - Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.
1727	1729	Could you tell me how I could find Chief Brody?
1729	1730	Who are you?
1730	1733	Matt Hooper. I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.
1733	1737	For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.
1737	1739	I'm glad to meet you. - Me, too.
1739	1741	I know you got a lot on your hands right now, but...
1742	1745	The best thing for me to do is to see the remains of the first victim.
1745	1747	The girl on the beach.
1747	1749	Just bear with me, will ya? - Sure.
1750	1753	Wait'll we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile.
1753	1754	There'll be some fun.
1755	1757	They'll wish their fathers had never met their mothers...
1757	1761	...when they start diggin' the bottoms out and slammin' into them rocks.
1761	1763	Get away from there, you goddamn fool.
1764	1765	What's the matter with you?
1765	1768	You want to swamp us, you crazy son of a bitch?
1768	1771	What are these guys doin' out here?
1771	1774	What are they doin' back there? - They're chummin' right now.
1774	1777	What is that? - They're tracking the shark now.
1777	1780	$3,000 divided four ways is what?
1788	1791	Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
1794	1797	Victim identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian.
1797	1802	And here's the way we have it. - Probable boating accident.
1806	1813	The height and weight of the victim can only be estimated from the partial remains.
1816	1818	The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.
1818	1821	There are no major organs remaining. May I have a glass of water?
1821	1826	The right arm has been severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss...
1826	1828	...in the upper musculature.
1829	1830	Thank you, very much.
1832	1836	Partially denuded bone remaining. This was no boat accident.
1836	1842	Did you notify the Coast Guard about this? - No. It was only local jurisdiction.
1844	1849	The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum and portions of the rib cage are intact.
1849	1852	Do not smoke in here. Thank you very much.
1853	1854	This is what happens.
1855	1860	Indicates the non-frenzy feeding of a large squalus, possibly longimanus...
1860	1862	...or isurus glaucus.
1863	1866	The amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis...
1866	1870	...however, the attacking squalus must be larger...
1870	1873	...than any normal squalus found in these waters.
1873	1875	Didn't you get a boat and check these waters?
1875	1878	This is not a boat accident.
1878	1882	And it wasn't any propeller. It wasn't any coral reef.
1882	1884	And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
1887	1888	It was a shark.
1904	1907	I wanna go AP and UPI. I wanna get on the state wire services.
1907	1909	See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.
1909	1912	Call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him he owes me a favor.
1912	1915	This is the shot I want with everybody and the fish in it.
1915	1918	Guys, could we please get organized?
1918	1921	I want to get a picture for the paper.
1921	1925	Ben Gardner get this? - No, no. We caught it.
1927	1930	That's swell. - It's a beauty, eh?
1931	1934	I need a picture for the paper. Clear out of the way, please.
1934	1937	Just the guys that caught the fish. Open it up a little bit.
1937	1941	I want to get a picture of the guy with the fish.
1941	1946	I need a picture for the paper. Could we get the sign please?
1953	1957	Young fella, could you step out of the picture?
1958	1960	We're ready.
1961	1964	Can you get that, please. - How's that?
1970	1972	Larry, you won't believe it.
1972	1974	What kind of a shark is that? - I don't know.
1974	1977	I think it's a mako. - It's got a deep throat, Frank.
1977	1982	Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark? - Tiger shark.
1982	1983	A what?
1983	1985	We can start breathing again.
1985	1987	Is Ben getting plenty of pictures? - You bet he is.
1987	1990	What is this bite radius crap?
1991	1997	You stuff your friggin' head in there man, and find out if it's a man-eater.
1999	2003	All I'm saying, is that it may not be the shark.
2003	2006	I want you to meet Matt. This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.
2007	2011	Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute. - Nice to meet you.
2012	2015	There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.
2015	2017	Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...
2017	2020	And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...
2020	2024	There are no other sharks like this here. - It's 100 to 1.
2024	2028	I'm not saying that this is not the shark. It probably is, Martin.
2028	2031	It's a man-eater. It's extremely rare for these waters.
2031	2034	The fact is, the bite radius on this animal is different...
2034	2037	...than the wounds on the victim.
2038	2040	I want to be sure. You want to be sure.
2040	2043	We all want to be sure. Okay? What I want to do is very simple.
2043	2046	The digestive system of this animal is very, very slow.
2046	2049	Let's cut it open. Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...
2049	2054	...is bound to still be in there. And then we'll be sure.
2058	2060	It may be the only way to confirm it.
2060	2063	Look, fellas let's be reasonable.
2063	2065	This is not the time or the place...
2065	2070	...to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.
2070	2073	I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open...
2073	2078	...and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock.
2100	2102	I just found out...
2103	2107	...that a girl got killed here last week.
2107	2109	And you knew it.
2110	2113	You knew there was a shark out there.
2114	2117	You knew it was dangerous.
2117	2120	But you let people go swimming anyway.
2123	2126	You knew all those things...
2129	2131	...but still my boy is dead now.
2135	2138	And there's nothing you can do about it.
2143	2145	My boy is dead.
2150	2153	I wanted you to know that.
2165	2168	I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.
2169	2171	No, she's not.
2176	2177	All right, fellas...
2177	2181	...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down before it stinks up the island.
2181	2186	Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink.
2253	2255	Come here.
2258	2260	Give us a kiss.
2260	2262	Why?
2263	2265	Because I need it.
2269	2271	Get out of here.
2273	2276	The door was open. Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.
2276	2277	Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2277	2280	Your husband's home? I'd really like to talk to him.
2280	2282	Yes, so would I.
2284	2286	Can I get you some coffee?
2287	2289	Wine. How nice.
2306	2308	How was your day?
2313	2315	Swell.
2318	2320	I got red and white. I didn't know what you'd be serving.
2320	2322	That's nice.
2323	2325	Is anyone eating this?
2334	2337	My husband tells me you're in sharks.
2339	2344	Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it quite put that way. But yes, I am.
2344	2345	I love sharks.
2345	2348	You love sharks? - Yeah, I love them.
2348	2352	When I was 12 years old, my father got me a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.
2352	2354	I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...
2354	2357	...I hooked a four and a half foot baby thresher shark...
2357	2360	...who proceeded to eat my boat.
2360	2363	He ate my oar, hooks, and my seat cushions.
2363	2366	He turned an inboard into an outboard. Scared me to death...
2366	2368	...and I swam back to shore.
2368	2369	When I was on the beach...
2370	2372	...I turned around and I saw my boat being taken apart.
2372	2375	Ever since then, I have been studying sharks...
2375	2378	...and that's why I'm gonna go to the Institute tomorrow...
2378	2381	...and tell them that you still have a shark problem here.
2381	2384	Why do you have to tell them that? - I'm sorry, I thought that...
2384	2386	You told me the shark was caught.
2386	2389	I heard it on the news. I heard it on the Cape station.
2389	2392	They caught a shark, not the shark.
2392	2394	Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.
2394	2397	And probably not the shark that killed the little boy.
2397	2400	Which I wanted to prove by cutting the shark open...
2400	2403	You may want to let that breathe... Nothing.
2420	2424	You'll be the only rational man left on this island after I leave tomorrow.
2424	2426	Where are you going?
2427	2429	I am going on the Aurora.
2429	2433	The Aurora? What is that? - It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.
2433	2435	Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.
2435	2439	Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.
2439	2443	Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland.
2443	2447	I guess it's a childhood thing. There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?
2447	2449	Drowning.
2449	2453	Is it true that most people get attacked by sharks in three feet of water...
2453	2456	...about 10 feet from the beach?
2457	2460	And before people started to swim for recreation...
2460	2463	...I mean before sharks knew what they were missing...
2463	2467	...that a lot of these attacks weren't reported?
2467	2469	That's right.
2470	2473	Now this shark that swims alone, what's it called?
2473	2475	Rogue. - Rogue, yeah.
2476	2477	Now, this guy...
2477	2480	...he keeps swimmin' around in a place where the feeding is good...
2480	2484	...until the food supply is gone. Right? - That's called territoriality.
2484	2488	It's just a theory that I happen to agree with.
2490	2496	Then why don't we have one more drink and go down and cut that shark open?
2496	2498	Can you do that?
2501	2504	I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.
2509	2512	We start in the alimentary canal...
2513	2516	...open the digestive tract.
2544	2547	Just like I thought. - What?
2547	2551	Came up from the Gulf Stream from southern waters.
2556	2558	He didn't eat a car, did he?
2558	2561	Tiger shark's like a garbage can. It'll eat anything.
2561	2564	Somebody probably threw that in the river.
2570	2572	That's it.
2573	2577	I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.
2577	2579	You got a bigger problem than that.
2579	2581	You still got a hell of a fish out there...
2582	2584	...with a mouth about this big.
2588	2591	How do we confirm that by morning?
2591	2595	If he is a rogue, and there's any truth to territoriality at all...
2595	2598	...we could spot him between Cape Scott and South Beach.
2598	2600	Where're you going? - To find him. He's a night feeder.
2601	2603	On the water. - We're not gonna find him on the land.
2603	2605	I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.
2605	2607	Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.
2607	2609	I can't do that. - Yes, you can.
2617	2621	I'm tellin' you, the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.
2621	2624	There's so many problems, you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.
2625	2627	Violence, rip-offs, muggings.
2628	2631	The kids can't leave the house. You've got to walk them to school.
2631	2634	But in Amity, one man can make a difference.
2634	2639	In 25 years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town.
2639	2641	No kidding? Want a pretzel?
2642	2643	Where are we?
2643	2647	We're right in the stretch where he's been feeding.
2648	2650	Can you get the Late Show on this thing?
2650	2655	No, it's a closed circuit TV system. I have underwater cameras fore and aft.
2655	2658	Who pays for all this stuff? The Government? The Institute?
2658	2661	This stuff cost a lot of money.
2662	2666	I paid for this mostly myself, actually. - You're kidding.
2666	2668	You rich? - Yeah.
2669	2670	How much?
2670	2673	Personally or the whole family?
2673	2678	Doesn't make any sense. They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
2679	2683	It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates the water to live on an island, either.
2683	2686	It's only an island if you look at it from the water.
2686	2688	That makes a lot of sense.
2694	2696	What is that thing doing?
2698	2699	It's a fish finder.
2699	2705	It's probably just a school of mackerel or something, all clumped together.
2705	2707	Wait a minute.
2711	2714	There's somethin' else out there. - What is it?
2714	2717	About 100 yards, south, southwest.
2750	2753	That's Ben Gardner's boat. - You know him?
2753	2757	It's all banged up. Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.
2758	2760	What happened?
2765	2767	I got to go down there and check their hull.
2767	2769	Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?
2769	2772	We will. I just got to check something out.
2772	2774	Keep the lights going.
2797	2799	Let's tow it in.
2799	2802	Don't worry, Martin. Nothing's gonna happen.
2806	2808	What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
2808	2813	Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Don't touch any of the equipment.
2815	2817	I'll be back in two minutes.
2901	2902	This is a great white. A big one.
2903	2906	Any shark expert in the world will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.
2906	2910	A great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island.
2911	2914	He'll continue to feed here as long as there's food in the water.
2914	2917	There's no limit to what he'll do. We've had three incidents.
2917	2919	Two people killed in a week. It'll happen again.
2919	2921	It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.
2921	2923	Five people were killed... - In one week.
2923	2924	Tell him about the swimmers.
2924	2928	A shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity...
2928	2930	...that occurs whenever people swim. You can't avoid it.
2930	2933	If you open the beaches on the Fourth of July...
2933	2935	...it's like ringing the dinner bell, for Christ sakes.
2935	2939	I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass, out of a boat out there.
2939	2941	It was the tooth of a great white.
2941	2945	It was Gardner's boat all chewed up. I helped tow it. You should've seen it.
2945	2948	Where is that tooth? Did you see it, Brody?
2948	2949	I didn't see it.
2949	2952	He dropped it on the way in. - I had an accident.
2952	2956	And what did you say the name of this shark is?
2956	2959	It's a carcharodon carcharias. It's a great white.
2959	2961	You don't have the tooth?
2963	2965	We depend on the summer people for our lives...
2965	2968	You are not gonna have a summer unless you deal with this problem.
2968	2971	We have to close the beaches, and hire somebody to kill the shark.
2972	2973	We have to tell the Coast Guard.
2973	2976	You'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel.
2976	2978	You'll have to ring this entire harbor.
2978	2982	I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems.
2982	2985	I know that you are going to ignore...
2985	2988	...this problem until it swims up and bites you on the ass.
2988	2991	Wait a second. There are two ways to deal with this.
2991	2995	You're either gonna kill this animal, or cut off it's food supply.
2995	2997	We have to close the beaches.
2998	3000	Sick vandalism.
3000	3004	That is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message.
3004	3007	I want those little paint-happy bastards caught...
3007	3010	...and hung up by their Buster-Browns. - That's it. Goodbye.
3010	3014	I won't waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.
3014	3016	Don't do this.
3023	3028	What we are dealing with here, is a perfect engine, an eating machine.
3028	3032	It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim...
3032	3036	...and eat, and make little sharks. And that's all.
3036	3039	Now, why don't you take a long, close look at this sign.
3039	3042	Those proportions are correct. - You'd love to prove that.
3042	3045	Get your name into the National Geographic.
3056	3060	Larry, if we make an effort today, we might be able to save August.
3060	3063	August? For Christ sake, tomorrow's the Fourth of July.
3063	3065	And we will be open for business.
3065	3067	This will be the best summer we've ever had.
3067	3071	If you are concerned about the beaches do what you have to, to make them safe.
3071	3075	But those beaches will be open for this weekend.
3096	3098	I want to know how many men you're going to send.
3098	3100	I don't need to come to Brisbane...
3100	3103	...when I have a great white shark right here.
3103	3105	We need men to patrol the swimming area.
3105	3110	We've got to have help. Anybody with a gun or a boat.
3121	3123	Monday.
3124	3130	Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there? He's the little guy with a crew cut.
3144	3150	Operator, isn't there a phone on the island? Could you connect me, please?
3163	3165	Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?
3166	3169	The guys from the TV station on the mainland are here.
3169	3172	All right. I'll get to them later.
3174	3177	Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.
3183	3185	Brody to Daisy, do you read me?
3185	3188	Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me? Come in, Hooper. What do you see?
3188	3191	Nothing, here, Martin. And nothing on sonar.
3191	3195	Amity Island has long been known for it's clean air, clear water...
3195	3197	...beautiful white sand beaches.
3198	3199	But in recent days...
3199	3202	...a cloud has appeared on the horizon of this beautiful resort community.
3202	3206	A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.
3233	3237	Hi, Larry. - Why aren't you in the water?
3238	3242	I just put some sun tan lotion on, and I'm trying to absorb some...
3242	3244	Nobody's going in.
3245	3247	Please, get in the water.
3306	3308	Do me a favor, will you?
3308	3312	You and the other guys take the boat and put it in the pond instead.
3312	3313	The pond's for old ladies.
3314	3318	I know it's for the old ladies, but just do it for the old man.
3318	3321	All right. - Thanks.
3333	3335	I've got Sean.
3342	3343	Michael, wait.
3343	3346	Michael, I don't like you no more.
3370	3372	Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.
3373	3376	Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
3379	3382	False alarm. Must be this glare.
3393	3395	I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have...
3396	3400	...caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.
3400	3402	As you see, it's a beautiful day.
3402	3405	The beaches are open, and people are having a wonderful time.
3405	3409	'Amity,' as you know, means 'friendship.'
3419	3422	My God.
3432	3434	Jesus Christ. Fin. Shark. 350.
3439	3443	Martin, get them the hell out of the water.
3447	3449	No whistles. No whistles.
3449	3454	Everybody please, get out of the water. Everybody out of the water.
3516	3520	Give an answer, please. What's going on out there?
3523	3526	He made me do it. He talked me into it.
3526	3531	Please, please, move back. Please. Give these people some air.
3532	3537	Martin it's just a hoax. There are two kids with a cardboard fin.
3537	3542	Everyone there okay? Everyone get out of the water all right?
3546	3548	Shark. A shark.
3549	3554	It's going into the pond. Shark in estuary. - Now what?
3555	3556	Michael's in the pond.
3558	3562	Somebody do something. It's in the pond.
3573	3577	Hurry up. Get that done. - I can't do a damn thing.
3582	3585	Haul in your sheet. Make it fast.
3589	3591	You guys okay over there?
3591	3593	In the pond.
3632	3637	Somebody get a gun and shoot it. Doesn't anybody have a gun?
3658	3661	Is he dead? - No, he's not. He's in shock.
3691	3696	Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock. He can go home in the morning.
3697	3699	How's my big kid? - I'm all right.
3699	3702	You gonna miss me tonight? You can watch television.
3702	3704	Want anything from home? - My cars.
3704	3707	What about ice cream? - Coffee.
3718	3720	Want to take him home?
3722	3724	Like to New York?
3724	3726	No. Home, here.
3744	3746	I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.
3747	3749	You got a pen, Larry?
3749	3751	Yeah, pen, you know.
3754	3756	'Cause you're gonna do what you do best.
3756	3759	You're gonna sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor.
3759	3764	I don't know if I can do that without... - I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.
3764	3766	August? - What?
3767	3768	What are you talkin' about?
3769	3771	Summer's over. You're the Mayor of Shark City.
3771	3773	These people think you want the beaches open.
3774	3776	I was acting in the town's best interest.
3776	3778	You were acting in the town's best interest.
3778	3780	That's why you're gonna do the right thing.
3780	3787	That's why you're gonna sign this, and we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.
3788	3791	My kids were on that beach, too.
3801	3803	Sign it, Larry.
3812	3813	$10,000.
3813	3817	$200 a day, whether I catch him or not. - You've got it.
3817	3820	Get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more zoning crap.
3820	3821	You've got that.
3821	3825	One case of apricot brandy, and you buy the lunch.
3825	3828	Two cases. And you get dinner when you get back.
3828	3832	Champagne, pâté de foie gras, Iranian caviar...
3832	3834	...and don't forget the color TV.
3838	3840	You try this. Made it myself. Pretty good stuff.
3840	3842	Thanks.
3842	3846	Here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women.
3852	3854	Excuse me, Chief.
3868	3870	Can't get a good man these days, under 60.
3870	3873	All gone at least 35 years.
3873	3875	Don't drink that.
3880	3881	You'll need an extra hand.
3881	3883	This is Matt Hooper. - I know.
3883	3885	I've crewed three Trans Pacs. - Transplants?
3885	3889	He's from the Oceanographic Institute. - And an America's Cup trial.
3889	3893	Mr. Hooper, I'm not talkin' about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.
3893	3897	I'm talkin' about workin' for a living. I'm talkin' about sharkin'.
3897	3900	I'm not talkin' about hookin' some poor dogfish or sand shark.
3900	3902	I'm talkin' about finding a great white.
3902	3905	Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?
3910	3912	Just tie me a sheepshank.
3914	3918	I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time.
3918	3921	You didn't say how short you wanted it.
3923	3925	How's that?
3928	3929	Gimme your hands.
3931	3932	Dogfish?
3932	3935	You got a $5,000 net and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.
3935	3938	Along comes Mr. Whitey, by the time he's finished with that net...
3938	3944	...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class has cut it up for a paper doll.
3944	3948	You got city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life.
3948	3951	I don't need this. I don't need this working class hero crap.
3951	3956	You're not gonna do this aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?
3956	3958	Maybe I should go alone.
3961	3963	It's my party. It's my charter.
3964	3967	Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party. It's my vessel.
3967	3968	You're on board my vessel...
3968	3971	...l'm mate, master, pilot...
3971	3973	...and I'm captain.
3976	3979	I'll take him for ballast, Chief.
3980	3982	You got him.
3986	3990	Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, pliers, irons...
3991	3993	Sample bottles, dye marker, flares, safety float...
3994	3996	...temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...
3996	4000	What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?
4008	4012	Take that stuff down below and you lash it secure.
4016	4018	Jesus H. Christ.
4018	4024	When I was a boy, every squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.
4024	4027	What have you got here? A portable shower or a monkey cage?
4027	4030	An anti-shark cage. - Anti-shark cage?
4031	4033	You go inside the cage?
4035	4037	Cage goes in the water?
4037	4040	You go in the water? Shark's in the water.
4041	4042	Our shark.
4044	4048	'Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies...
4049	4052	'Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain...
4053	4058	'For we've received orders for to sail back to Boston...
4060	4064	'And so never more shall we see you again'
4070	4073	Did you take your Dramamine? - Yes.
4073	4077	I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks...
4077	4083	...and there's the stuff for your nose, the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.
4083	4086	Goddamn women today, they can't handle nothin'.
4086	4089	Young girls just ain't quite smart like their grandmothers were.
4089	4091	That's got to be Quint.
4091	4092	Colorful, isn't he?
4093	4094	He scares me.
4096	4101	Don't use the fireplace in the den. - What am I gonna tell the kids?
4103	4105	Tell them I'm going fishing.
4110	4114	Break it up, will ya, Chief? Daylight's wastin'.
4116	4118	Front: bow. Back: stern.
4118	4119	Better get it right, squirt...
4119	4123	...or I throw your ass out the little round window on the side.
4123	4126	This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
4126	4128	See you got your rubbers.
4130	4135	'Here lies the body of Mary Lee, Died at the age of 103...
4135	4140	'For 15 years she kept her virginity, Not a bad record for this vicinity'
4140	4144	All right, Commissioner, fasten your safety belt.
4145	4148	If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow.
4151	4154	Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
4163	4165	How's the Missus, Chief?
4166	4171	If they don't like you goin' out, they'll love you comin' in.
4194	4198	Keep that chum line goin'. We got five good miles on it.
4199	4203	Who's driving this boat? - Nobody. The tide.
4203	4207	One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk. Had to stick two barrels in him.
4207	4210	Two to wear him down and bring him up.
4210	4213	Nowadays, these kids, they take out everything.
4213	4216	Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.
4219	4221	Jesus H. Christ.
4222	4225	Best drop another chum marker.
4246	4248	Damn it, Martin.
4248	4250	This is compressed air.
4250	4254	What the hell kind of a knot was that? - You pulled the wrong one.
4254	4257	You screw around with these tanks, and they're gonna blow up.
4257	4261	Yeah, that's real fine, expensive gear you've brought out here.
4261	4264	I don't know what that bastard shark's gonna do with it.
4264	4269	Might eat it, I suppose. Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.
4272	4276	Next time, you just ask me which line to pull, right?
4281	4284	Little brown eel comes out of the cave...
4284	4286	...swims into the hole...
4287	4291	...comes out of the hole, back into the cave again.
4291	4293	It's not too good, is it?
4294	4297	Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.
4374	4376	I got it.
4377	4379	What? - Get behind me.
4382	4384	Hooper, reverse her.
4385	4387	Takin' a hell of a lot of line.
4387	4391	Get the scoop out of the bucket. Wet the reel.
4395	4397	Reverse her.
4399	4403	Duck your head down. We're swingin'. Get behind me again.
4403	4406	No more water. I don't want you to drown me.
4406	4410	Hooper, you idiot, starboard. Ain't you watchin' it.
4413	4415	Hooper, neutral.
4422	4424	Where'd he go now?
4424	4426	He ain't foolin' me.
4427	4429	What's he yankin' on now?
4430	4432	Go on, try it.
4443	4448	I don't know, Chief, if he's very smart or very dumb.
4453	4455	Jesus...
4458	4459	He's gone under.
4459	4464	He's gone under the boat. I think he's gone under the boat.
4464	4465	Yeah, it's too easy.
4465	4469	He is a smart, big fish. He's gone under the boat.
4469	4472	Keep her steady, now. I got somethin' very big.
4472	4474	I don't think so.
4475	4477	Chief, put your gloves on.
4477	4480	You put your gloves on, both of you.
4482	4485	Getting ready to run out again.
4485	4487	Quint, let it go.
4487	4490	You may be big in the lab, but out here you're just cargo.
4490	4493	If you don't want to backstroke home, you get down here.
4493	4496	You don't want to listen to me, don't listen to me.
4496	4499	It's not a shark. - The wire's showing.
4499	4501	Unbuckle me.
4502	4505	Get the other side. - It's a tuna or swordfish.
4508	4510	Take this rod.
4510	4513	Give the Chief a hand, will you? - Right.
4523	4525	It's a marlin or a stingray...
4526	4529	...but it's definitely a game fish.
4539	4541	Gamin' fish?
4541	4544	Marlin, stingray bit through this piano wire?
4545	4547	Don't you tell me my business again.
4547	4550	You get back on the bridge. - Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.
4550	4552	It proves one thing.
4552	4555	It proves that you wealthy college boys don't have the education enough...
4555	4558	...to admit when you're wrong.
4566	4569	What's the point? Hooks and lines?
4571	4573	You lose one, you rig one.
4578	4580	Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now. Full throttle.
4580	4582	Aye, aye, sir.
4584	4587	You see, what I do, Chief, is I trick 'em to the surface.
4587	4589	And then jab at 'em.
4589	4593	I'm not gonna haul 'em up like a lot of catfish.
4593	4595	Full throttle.
4595	4597	I don't have to take this abuse much longer.
4597	4601	Your head's bleeding. First aid there.
4628	4631	Start that chum line again, will ya?
4632	4634	Let Hooper take a turn.
4634	4637	Hooper drives the boat.
4651	4653	Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.
4653	4655	Slow ahead, if you please.
4656	4658	You heard him. Slow ahead.
4666	4668	Slow ahead.
4668	4673	I can go slow ahead. Come on down and chum some of this shit.
4689	4691	You're gonna need a bigger boat.
4705	4707	Shut off that engine.
4734	4736	That's a 20-footer. - 25.
4737	4739	Three tons of him.
4744	4746	We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?
4747	4748	Gotta get to work.
4748	4750	How do we handle this?
4750	4753	Come up front, Martin. I need you.
4754	4756	He's circling the boat.
4769	4772	Amity Point Light Station to Orca. This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
4773	4774	Come in, Orca.
4775	4778	Orca. Come in. - I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.
4778	4780	Put her on.
4780	4783	Come on, Martin. Move. - I'm not goin' out there.
4783	4788	Beyond the edge of the barrels. Go to the end of the barrels, further out.
4788	4789	Further out. - Why?
4789	4790	Go further out. - What for?
4790	4792	Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
4792	4794	What? - Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
4795	4797	I need something in the foreground to give it some scale.
4798	4799	Foreground my ass.
4799	4802	Your husband's okay. He's fishin'. He just caught some stripers.
4802	4804	We'll bring 'em for dinner. We won't be long.
4804	4806	We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
4806	4808	I'm not staying here. - I'm begging you.
4808	4810	Goddamn it.
4810	4812	Come here, come here, darlin'.
4817	4820	I want you up on the bridge, just take her forward, steady.
4820	4825	I've never steered a boat in my life. - Just watch my hand, take her steady.
4825	4828	Attach the end of this line to the first keg.
4828	4832	I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head.
4849	4851	Get clear of the bow.
4855	4858	Hurry up, will ya? - Your turn, Quint.
4858	4860	Hooper, where are you?
4864	4866	Hurry it up now, tie it on.
4867	4869	He's comin' straight for us. Don't screw up now.
4869	4871	Don't wait for me.
4873	4877	Come on, Hooper. Come on. Hurry it up. Tie it on.
4877	4879	Now. Now.
4882	4884	Kill it.
4884	4886	Now.
4887	4889	Shoot.
4891	4893	Time.
4894	4898	What were you doin', anyway? I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.
4898	4902	Let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up.
4903	4906	Free another barrel. I'm comin' around again.
4957	4959	What do we do now? We're quittin', right?
4959	4963	We got one barrel on him. We stay out here until we find him again.
4963	4967	We could radio in and get a bigger boat...
4990	4993	Don't you worry about it, Chief.
4993	4995	It won't be permanent.
4995	4998	You want to see something permanent?
5003	5006	You want to feel somethin' permanent?
5007	5011	Just put your hand underneath my cap. You feel that little lump?
5011	5014	Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.
5018	5020	I got that beat.
5027	5029	It's a moray eel.
5029	5032	It bit right through my wet suit.
5033	5036	I don't know about that, but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...
5037	5039	...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco. See this?
5039	5041	I can't extend that. You know why?
5041	5043	'Cause in the semi-final...
5043	5046	...celebrating my third wife's demise...
5046	5049	...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.
5061	5062	Look at that.
5064	5065	That's a bull shark.
5065	5069	He scraped me when I was takin' samples.
5069	5071	I got something for you.
5071	5075	There's a thresher. You see that? A thresher's tail.
5075	5077	Thresher? - It's a shark.
5079	5082	You want a drink? Drink to your leg? - I'll drink to your leg.
5082	5085	So we drink to our legs.
5090	5094	I got the crème de la crème. Right here. Hold on.
5094	5096	Here, you see that?
5096	5098	You're wearin' a sweater.
5098	5101	Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.
5102	5104	She broke my heart.
5113	5115	What's that one?
5115	5118	What? - That one, there. On your arm.
5120	5122	A tattoo. I got that removed.
5123	5126	Don't tell me. Don't tell me, 'Mother.'
5131	5133	What is it?
5137	5140	That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
5147	5149	You were on the Indianapolis?
5149	5151	What happened?
5152	5157	Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.
5158	5161	I was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte...
5161	5165	...just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb.
5167	5170	1,100 men went into the water.
5170	5172	Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
5174	5177	Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour.
5177	5179	Tiger, 13-footer.
5179	5182	Know how you know that when you're in the water?
5182	5186	You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.
5187	5189	Well, we didn't know.
5189	5192	Because our bomb mission had been so secret...
5192	5195	...no distress signal had been sent.
5201	5205	They didn't even list us overdue for a week.
5205	5209	Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...
5209	5213	...so we formed ourselves into tight groups.
5214	5217	Kinda like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar...
5217	5219	...like the Battle of Waterloo.
5219	5221	The idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man...
5221	5224	...and he starts poundin' hollerin' and screamin'.
5224	5227	Sometimes the shark would go away...
5228	5230	...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
5230	5233	Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you...
5233	5235	...right into your eyes.
5235	5238	You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...
5238	5240	...lifeless eyes.
5240	5243	Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
5244	5247	When he comes at you, he doesn't seem to be livin'...
5247	5249	...until he bites you.
5249	5253	Those little black eyes roll over white and then...
5254	5257	...then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'.
5257	5259	The ocean turns red...
5260	5265	...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in.
5265	5267	They rip you to pieces.
5271	5275	You know, by the end of that first dawn...
5275	5277	...we lost 100 men.
5278	5280	I don't know how many sharks. Maybe 1,000.
5281	5284	I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour.
5284	5287	On Thursday mornin', I bumped into a friend of mine...
5287	5290	...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.
5291	5293	Baseball player, Bosun's mate.
5295	5297	I thought he was asleep.
5298	5300	Reached over to wake him up.
5301	5305	He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top.
5305	5307	Upended.
5310	5313	He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.
5316	5320	Noon the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5320	5323	He swung in low and he saw us. He was a young pilot.
5323	5325	Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...
5325	5327	...and he came in low, and three hours later...
5327	5331	...a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up.
5331	5334	That was the time I was most frightened.
5334	5336	Waitin' for my turn.
5337	5340	I'll never put on a life jacket again.
5342	5345	So, 1,100 men went into the water...
5345	5346	...316 men come out.
5346	5350	The sharks took the rest June the 29th, 1945.
5353	5357	Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
5369	5370	What's that?
5371	5373	It's a whale.
5374	5378	'Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies...
5380	5384	'Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain'
5389	5393	'Show me the way to go home...
5394	5398	'I'm tired and I want to go to bed...
5399	5404	'I had a little drink about an hour ago...
5404	5408	'And it's gone right to my head...
5409	5413	'Wherever I may roam...
5414	5418	'By land, or sea, or foam...
5428	5431	'Show me the way to go home...
5432	5435	'I'm tired and I want to go to bed...
5435	5437	'I had a little drink about a hour ago...
5437	5440	'And it's gone right to my head...
5440	5442	'Wherever I may roam...
5442	5445	'On land or sea or foam...
5445	5448	'You can always hear me singing this...'
5451	5453	Start the engines.
5462	5464	Fire her up.
5472	5474	Put out the fire, will ya?
5483	5485	Pump her out. - Done.
5493	5495	Everybody on deck. - He ate the light.
5495	5497	Terrific. - Excuse me.
5499	5503	Quint, what are you doing? Don't waste your time.
5503	5505	What's wrong with this?
5507	5512	Hooper, take the wheel. Brody, follow that. Watch for him.
5528	5530	You okay?
5531	5533	You okay?
5556	5558	More left rudder.
5559	5560	Pull your left hand down.
5560	5563	I can't. It'll only go about three inches.
5563	5568	All of our injectors got scored from the salt water in the fuel.
5568	5571	Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.
5571	5576	Try the left rudder again. More left. Good. Once again now.
5579	5581	There it is.
5581	5582	What do you say, Chief?
5582	5586	The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.
5589	5593	I think he's right under the keg. Grab the boat hook.
5604	5606	If we can get close enough...
5607	5613	...l've got things on board that'll kill it. - Just want to goose him up. Come on.
5622	5627	When he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands.
5627	5632	I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles. Whole sea's bones, full of 'em.
5632	5634	Give it to me a minute.
5648	5651	Haul in that line or it'll foul us.
5652	5653	Start the engine.
5655	5659	Where are you goin'? - I'm gonna make a phone call.
5664	5667	Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?
5668	5670	Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you read me?
5670	5673	Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...
5678	5680	Excuse me, Chief.
5680	5685	That's great. That's just great. Now, where the hell are we?
5687	5691	You're certifiable, Quint. You know that? You're certifiable.
5691	5695	You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this. - Boys.
5695	5699	I think he's come back for his noon feeding.
5699	5701	Hook me up another barrel.
5730	5733	Bring her around after him.
5748	5751	Full throttle. Get me right up alongside of him.
5751	5755	I can't rev it up that high, it's not gonna take it.
5771	5773	Five degrees port.
5779	5782	All right, hold your course.
5787	5789	Five degrees port now.
5792	5794	Hold your course.
5795	5798	Fast fish. - Watch my hand.
5799	5802	Be sure you watch my hand. Follow me. Follow me.
5803	5807	Lad, you watch him now. Starboard. Starboard.
5807	5809	Run him down.
5816	5818	Hard apart.
5820	5821	Watch him.
5822	5823	Starboard.
5846	5851	I can't believe it. Two barrels and he's going down again.
5854	5856	It's incredible.
5862	5864	They're up again. - Now what?
5872	5878	Why don't we lead the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea?
5881	5883	Grab a couple of poles.
5885	5887	Hang on now, we're going around.
5887	5890	Into starboard. Easy.
5891	5896	I'm gonna back her off now. Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.
5899	5902	All right, gentlemen, snag them.
5906	5909	Now then tie them to the stern cleats.
5912	5915	Brody, bring your end around the cleat.
5915	5919	That's right, it'll lock itself off. Give him room, Brody.
5920	5922	Stay clear of the line.
5929	5931	Watch it. Stand clear.
5941	5943	Stand away from those stern cleats.
5956	5958	Back home we got a taxidermy man.
5958	5963	He gonna have a heart attack when he sees what I brought him.
5968	5971	Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.
5973	5975	My God, this one, too. They're both going.
5975	5980	He's eating his way through that line. - He's working his way right up to us.
5980	5983	Come on, Quint. Hurry.
5984	5986	Out of my way.
5991	5993	Watch it.
5996	5999	Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.
6002	6004	Make it fast.
6004	6006	I can't. It's trying to run.
6009	6011	Pull, you son of a bitch.
6013	6016	Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.
6022	6024	It's impossible.
6039	6041	We're breaking up. Cut it.
6042	6044	Watch your hands.
6045	6047	Cut it quick. I can't hold it.
6067	6069	He can't stay down with three barrels on him.
6069	6072	Not with three barrels, he can't.
6072	6074	What about us?
6075	6078	Get the pump out of the locker in front of you, will you?
6078	6079	We're gonna sink, aren't we?
6079	6083	Keep an eye on the barrels. Pump it out, Chief.
6088	6090	Starting to go under.
6090	6095	He can't with three barrels on him. Not with three he can't.
6127	6129	You ever have one do this before?
6131	6133	No.
6162	6165	He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.
6170	6172	I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.
6172	6176	Draw him into the shallow water. I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.
6177	6180	We're headin' in, Brody. - Thank Christ.
6186	6190	You ever had a great white do that? - No.
6195	6197	How far do we have to go?
6199	6202	Don't put that much pressure on it.
6211	6214	Goddamn it. - Shut up. Get back there.
6219	6221	Hold on.
6235	6239	'Farewell and adieu to you, fair Spanish ladies...
6242	6247	'Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain...
6248	6252	'For we received order for to sail back to Boston'
6254	6257	You idiot, you burned out the bearings.
6258	6261	All right stop the boat. Stop the boat. Stop it.
6357	6361	What exactly can you do with these things of yours?
6363	6368	I think I can pump 20 ccm of strychnine nitrate into him.
6368	6370	If I can get close enough.
6372	6376	Get this little needle through his skin?
6377	6379	No, I can't do that.
6379	6382	If I can get him close to the cage, I can get him in the mouth.
6383	6388	That shark'll rip that cage to pieces. - You got any better suggestions?
6411	6413	Easy.
6415	6416	Up she goes.
6469	6470	Ain't got no spit.
6485	6488	Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.
6490	6492	Okay, okay, I'm ready.
6660	6664	Bring him up, goddamn it. Bring him up now.
6669	6671	Pull it up. Pull it.
6681	6683	Come on, Quint, bring him in.
6686	6688	It's giving way.
6699	6701	Rig something.
6704	6706	Got it?
6709	6711	It's comin'.
6713	6714	Slower.
6901	6902	Show me the tank.
6920	6922	Blow up.
6924	6926	Smile, you son of a bitch.
7011	7013	Quint?
7014	7015	No.
7024	7026	Can we get in on those?
7032	7034	What day is this?
7035	7038	It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think.
7039	7042	I think the tide's with us.
7042	7044	Keep kicking.
7047	7049	I used to hate the water.
7051	7053	I can't imagine why.
