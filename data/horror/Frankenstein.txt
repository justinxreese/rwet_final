1	3	How do you do?
6	8	Mr Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind
8	13	to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning.
13	16	We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein.
17	19	A man of science,
19	22	who sought to create a man after his own image,
22	25	without reckoning upon God.
26	30	It is one of the strangest tales ever told.
30	34	It deals with the two great mysteries of creation:
34	36	life and death.
37	39	I think it will thrill you.
40	42	It may shock you.
42	45	It might even horrify you.
46	50	So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain,
50	53	now is your chance to, er...
53	56	Well, we've warned you.
123	127	(man)... dona eis, Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.
127	129	Amen.
132	134	(bell tolls)
135	137	(sobbing)
155	157	Down. Down, you fool!
251	253	Now!
253	255	Come on!
258	260	Hurry, hurry.
279	282	The moon's rising. We've no time to lose.
282	283	(clattering)
284	286	Careful!
292	295	Here he comes!
304	308	He's just resting. Waiting for a new life to come.
331	333	Here we are.
339	342	Look, it's still here.
345	347	Climb up and cut the rope.
347	350	- No! - Go on. It can't hurt you.
351	353	Here's a knife.
376	378	Look out!
380	382	Here's the knife.
382	384	Here I come.
387	389	Is it all right?
389	393	The neck's broken. The brain is useless!
394	396	We must find another brain.
405	408	That'll do, gentlemen.
417	419	(laughter)
428	430	And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen,
430	434	here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain
434	437	ever to come to my attention at the university.
437	441	And here, the abnormal brain of the typical criminal.
441	442	Observe, ladies and gentlemen,
443	446	the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe
446	448	as compared to that of the normal brain,
449	454	and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
454	456	All of these degenerate characteristics
456	459	check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us,
459	465	whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
465	468	These jars will remain here for your further inspection.
468	471	Thank you, gentlemen. The class is dismissed.
521	523	(cries out)
533	536	(gong)
540	542	(faint voices)
566	568	Herr Victor Moritz.
571	573	Victor.
573	576	- I'm so glad you've come. - What is it, Elizabeth?
576	579	- Oh, you've heard from Henry. - Yes. The first word in four months.
579	582	It just came.
582	585	- Victor, you must help me. - Of course I'll help you.
586	588	I'm afraid.
588	593	I've read this over and over again, but they're just words that I can't understand.
593	595	Listen.
595	598	"You must have faith in me, Elizabeth. Wait."
598	601	"My work must come first, even before you."
601	604	"At night, the winds howl in the mountains."
604	606	"There is no one here."
606	609	"Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."
609	612	- What can he mean? - What does he say then?
614	619	"I am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of Goldstadt."
619	622	"Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments."
623	627	- Oh. His experiments. - Yes, that's what frightens me.
627	631	The day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
631	635	He said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
635	639	There was a strange look in his eyes. Some mystery.
639	642	His words carried me right away.
642	647	Of course, I've never doubted him. But still, I worry. I can't help it.
647	651	And now this letter. All this uncertainty can't go on. I must know.
651	654	Victor, have you seen him?
654	656	Yes. About three weeks ago.
656	660	I met him walking alone in the woods. He spoke to me of his work, too.
660	663	I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.
663	666	He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there.
666	670	- His manner was very strange. - Oh, what can we do?
670	673	- If he should be ill! - Now, don't worry.
673	676	I'll go to Dr Waldman, Henry's old professor in medical school.
676	679	Perhaps he can tell me more about all this.
679	681	Victor, you're a dear.
681	683	You know I'd go to the ends of the earth for you.
684	687	I shouldn't like that. I'm far too fond of you.
687	689	I wish you were.
691	693	- Victor. - I'm sorry.
698	700	Good night, Victor. And thank you. Thank you.
700	704	Good night. And don't worry. Promise?
704	706	I won't.
711	713	- Victor! - What is it?
715	717	- I'm coming with you. - You can't!
717	720	I must. I'll be ready in a minute.
724	729	Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man, yet so erratic.
729	731	He troubles me.
731	735	I'm worried about Henry. Why has he left the university?
735	739	He was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work.
740	744	You know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology
744	748	were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
748	751	In fact, they had reached a most advanced stage.
751	753	They were becoming dangerous.
755	757	Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.
757	759	You mean changed as a result of his work?
759	761	Yes. His work.
761	764	His insane ambition to create life.
765	768	How? How?
769	772	Please tell us everything, whatever it is.
772	776	The bodies we use now, dissecting them for lecture purposes,
776	779	were not perfect enough for his experiments, he said.
779	782	He wished us to supply him with other bodies,
782	786	and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
787	789	I told him that his demands were unreasonable,
789	793	and so he left the university to work unhampered.
793	796	- He found what he needed elsewhere. - Oh. The bodies of animals.
796	799	Well, what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs?
800	802	You do not quite get what I mean.
803	806	Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life.
807	810	First to destroy it, then re-create it.
811	814	There you have his mad dream.
817	820	- Can we go to him? - You will not be very welcome.
820	823	What does that matter? I must see him.
824	829	Dr Waldman, you have influence with Henry. Won't you come with us?
829	833	I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil.
833	838	But he respects you. Won't you help us to take him away?
838	841	Very well, Fräulein. I've warned you.
841	843	But if you wish it, I will go.
848	850	(thunder rumbles)
867	869	- Fritz! - Hello.
871	875	- Have you finished those connections? - Yes, they're done.
875	878	Well, come down, then, and help. We've lots to do.
896	898	(thunderclap)
902	905	Look out!
908	909	Fool!
909	911	If this storm develops as I hope,
912	915	you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over.
915	917	Go on, fix the electrodes.
926	928	(crackling)
929	932	This storm will be magnificent.
932	934	All the electrical secrets of heaven.
935	939	And this time we're ready. Hey, Fritz? Ready.
941	943	Oh!
943	945	- Why, what's the matter? - Look.
948	950	There's nothing to fear. Look.
952	954	No blood, no decay.
955	957	Just a few stitches.
959	962	And look. Here's the final touch.
966	969	- The brain you stole, Fritz. - Yes.
969	972	Think of it-the brain of a dead man
972	975	waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands.
977	979	With my own hands.
982	985	Let's have one final test. Throw the switches.
985	987	(thunderclap)
1002	1003	Good.
1003	1007	In 15 minutes, the storm should be at its height.
1007	1009	Then we'll be ready.
1009	1010	(knocking at door)
1010	1013	What's that?
1015	1018	- There's someone there. - Shh! Quiet.
1021	1024	Send them away! Nobody must come here.
1025	1027	Here. Cover this.
1040	1042	Whoever it is, don't let them in.
1043	1045	Leave them to me.
1047	1050	Of all the times for anybody to come! Now!
1052	1055	- (Fritz mutters) - (knocking continues)
1055	1058	I'll show them, messing about at this time of night. Got too much to do.
1058	1061	- (banging at door) - Wait a minute! All right, all right!
1062	1065	Wait a minute, I'm coming.
1066	1069	- It's Dr Waldman, Fritz. - You can't see him. Go away.
1072	1074	(knocking continues)
1074	1077	All right, knock! You won't get in.
1083	1084	(mutters)
1085	1087	- Henry! - Frankenstein!
1087	1089	- Henry! - Frankenstein!
1089	1092	Henry!
1092	1094	- (Elizabeth) Open the door! - (Victor) Let us in!
1094	1098	Who is it? What do you want? You must leave me alone now.
1098	1101	It's Elizabeth! Open the door!
1112	1114	- Henry! - Frankenstein!
1116	1118	- What do you want? - Open the door!
1118	1122	- You must leave me alone. - (Elizabeth) At least give us shelter.
1130	1133	- What's this nonsense of locked doors? - Henry!
1133	1137	Elizabeth, please, won't you go away? Won't you trust me just for tonight?
1137	1142	- You're ill. What's the matter? - Nothing. I'm quite all right. Truly I am.
1142	1144	Can't you see I mustn't be disturbed?
1144	1148	You'll ruin everything. My experiment is almost completed.
1148	1151	Wait a moment. I understand.
1152	1155	I believe in you. But I cannot leave you tonight.
1155	1159	- You've got to leave! - Henry, you're inhuman. You're crazy!
1160	1162	Crazy, am I?
1163	1166	We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.
1170	1172	Come on up.
1186	1189	You're quite sure you want to come in?
1193	1194	Very well.
1213	1217	Forgive me, but I'm forced to take unusual precautions.
1222	1224	Sit down, please.
1226	1228	Sit down!
1232	1235	You too, Elizabeth. Please.
1239	1241	A moment ago, you said I was crazy.
1243	1246	- Tomorrow, we'll see about that. - (Fritz) Don't touch that!
1246	1248	(thunderclap)
1251	1254	I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.
1267	1269	Please.
1274	1278	Doctor Waldman, I learnt a great deal from you at the university
1278	1282	about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray,
1282	1285	which you said was the highest colour in the spectrum.
1286	1289	You were wrong.
1289	1293	Here, in this machinery, I have gone beyond that.
1295	1299	I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world.
1299	1302	Oh. And your proof?
1302	1305	Tonight you shall have your proof.
1307	1310	At first I experimented only with dead animals,
1310	1314	and then a human heart, which I kept beating for three weeks.
1316	1321	But now I'm going to turn that ray on that body,
1321	1323	and endow it with life.
1323	1327	And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
1328	1330	That body is not dead.
1330	1332	It has never lived.
1333	1337	I created it. I made it with my own hands
1337	1341	from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere.
1344	1347	Go and see for yourself.
1347	1349	(thunderclap)
1349	1351	You too.
1356	1358	Dead, hey?
1365	1368	Quite a good scene, isn't it?
1368	1370	One man crazy,
1370	1373	three very sane spectators.
1374	1376	(thunderclap)
1377	1378	Yes!
1379	1381	Test the batteries.
1488	1490	Look. It's moving.
1492	1494	It's alive. It's alive!
1496	1500	It's alive. It's moving. It's alive!
1500	1504	It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!
1504	1506	- It's alive! - Henry, in the name of God!
1506	1509	In the name of God?! Now I know what it...
1509	1512	(voice drowned out by thunder)
1519	1521	Henry is well, but he's very busy.
1521	1523	He said he would get in touch with you soon.
1523	1527	Don't worry about him, Baron. He'll be home in a few days.
1527	1530	You two have it all arranged, haven't you?
1530	1532	You think I'm an idiot, don't you?
1533	1535	But I'm not.
1535	1538	Anyone can see with half an eye that there's something wrong.
1539	1541	And I've two eyes, and pretty good ones at that.
1542	1545	- Well, what is it? - You're quite mistaken, Baron.
1545	1548	What's the matter with my son? What's he doing?
1548	1550	He's completing his experiments.
1550	1553	Why does he go messing around an old ruined windmill
1553	1558	when he has a decent house, a bath, good food and drink,
1558	1562	and a darned pretty girl to come back to? Would you tell me that?
1562	1566	- Baron, you don't understand. - I understand perfectly well.
1566	1569	There's another woman, and you're afraid to tell me.
1569	1572	Pretty sordid experiments these must be. Huh!
1572	1576	- Oh, but you're wrong! - And how do you know?
1576	1579	If you please, Herr Baron, the burgomaster.
1579	1582	- Well, tell him to go away. - But he says it's important.
1582	1587	Nothing the burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance.
1588	1591	Good day, Herr Baron. Fräulein.
1591	1593	Well, what do you want?
1593	1596	If it's trouble, go away. I've trouble enough.
1596	1600	- Oh, there's no trouble, sir. - What do you mean, "no trouble"?
1600	1602	There's nothing but trouble.
1602	1606	- I brought you these flowers. - Thank you, Herr Vogel.
1606	1610	Both in my private and official capacities as burgomaster...
1610	1614	Yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
1614	1618	What I really want to know is when will the wedding be, if you please.
1618	1622	Unless Henry comes to his senses, there'll be no wedding at all.
1623	1627	- But the village is already prepared. - Well, tell them to unprepare.
1627	1630	But such a lovely bride...
1630	1633	Such a fine young man, the very image of his father.
1633	1636	- Heaven forbid. - But, sir, everything is ready!
1636	1640	I know that! Don't keep on saying so, you idiot!
1640	1642	There's nothing to cry about.
1642	1646	Good day, Miss Elizabeth. Good day, Herr Moritz.
1646	1649	Good day, Herr Vogel.
1649	1651	Good day, Herr Baron.
1652	1655	And good riddance to you.
1655	1658	There you are. Huh! You see how it is.
1658	1662	The whole village is kept waiting, the bride is kept waiting,
1663	1668	and I am kept waiting. Henry must come home, if I have to fetch him myself.
1668	1670	No, no, Baron. What about his work?
1670	1673	Stuff and nonsense. What about his wedding?
1673	1676	There is another woman...
1676	1678	and I'm going to find her.
1684	1686	(Dr Waldman huffs)
1690	1692	Come and sit down, Doctor.
1693	1695	You must be patient.
1695	1697	Do you expect perfection at once?
1697	1701	This creature of yours should be kept under guard.
1701	1704	Mark my words, he will prove dangerous.
1705	1707	Dangerous?
1707	1709	Poor old Waldman.
1712	1716	Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous?
1716	1720	Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
1721	1724	Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars?
1724	1728	Or to know what causes the trees to bud?
1728	1731	And what changes the darkness into light?
1733	1737	But if you talk like that... people call you crazy.
1739	1743	Well, if I could discover just one of these things -
1743	1746	what eternity is, for example -
1746	1750	I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy.
1751	1755	You're young, my friend. Your success has intoxicated you.
1755	1757	Wake up and look facts in the face!
1758	1761	Here we have a fiend whose brain...
1761	1764	Whose brain must be given time to develop.
1764	1767	It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.
1767	1770	Well, you ought to know. It came from your own laboratory.
1771	1775	The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain.
1785	1789	Oh, well. After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.
1789	1791	Only evil can come of it.
1792	1795	Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness.
1795	1797	I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.
1798	1801	You have created a monster and it will destroy you.
1801	1803	Patience, patience.
1804	1807	I believe in this monster, as you call it.
1807	1810	And if you don't, well, you must leave me alone.
1810	1813	But think of Elizabeth. Your father.
1813	1815	Elizabeth believes in me.
1815	1818	My father? He never believes in anyone.
1820	1823	I've got to experiment further.
1823	1825	He's only a few days old, remember.
1825	1829	So far, he's been kept in complete darkness.
1829	1831	Wait till I bring him into the light.
1831	1833	(footsteps)
1837	1840	Here he comes. Let's turn out the light.
1879	1881	Come in.
1882	1884	Come in.
1904	1907	Sit down. Sit down!
1914	1917	You see? It understands.
1918	1919	Watch.
1962	1966	(Waldman) Take care now, Frankenstein. Take care.
1969	1972	Shut out the light.
1989	1991	Sit down.
1993	1995	Go and sit down.
2014	2019	- It understands this time. It's wonderful. - Frankenstein, where is it?!
2019	2020	Aagh!
2020	2022	Quiet, you fool!
2025	2027	Get away with that torch.
2042	2045	- Aagh! - Quick!
2045	2047	Fetch the rope, quick.
2047	2049	Stop pushing.
2049	2052	- Get him to the cellar. - Shoot it! It's a monster.
2054	2056	(clanking chains)
2056	2058	(howling)
2066	2068	Quiet. Quiet!
2073	2076	Stop that! You'll have the whole countryside on us!
2076	2079	Come away. He has the strength of ten men!
2079	2081	(monster yells)
2081	2083	Here, give me that!
2085	2087	Come away, Fritz.
2087	2090	Leave it alone. Leave it alone.
2107	2109	(yelling)
2114	2116	(screaming)
2117	2120	Listen. What's that? Who's there?
2124	2125	(yelling)
2126	2128	It's Fritz!
2132	2134	(monster growls)
2135	2137	Come on, Doctor. Quick, hurry.
2142	2144	(growls)
2145	2146	Get back.
2147	2149	- (growls) - Get out!
2150	2152	Come on, quickly.
2159	2161	(growling)
2165	2167	(banging on door)
2169	2171	(banging continues)
2175	2178	He hated Fritz. Fritz always tormented him.
2182	2184	Come, pull yourself together.
2184	2187	- What can we do? - Kill it, as you would any savage animal.
2187	2191	We must overpower him first. Get me a hypodermic needle.
2191	2193	- It's murder. - It's our only chance.
2193	2197	In a few minutes, he'll be through that door. Come, quick. Hurry.
2198	2200	(banging on door continues)
2208	2210	- Got it? - Yes, here it is.
2210	2214	- It's very strong. Half-grain solution. - Good. Now then.
2215	2219	You stand there. When he goes toward you, I will make the injection in his back.
2221	2223	- Ready? - Yes.
2235	2238	(growls)
2246	2248	Aagh!
2249	2251	Get back! Back!
2277	2279	(knock at door)
2283	2285	Dr Waldman. Dr Waldman!
2286	2289	- Are you hurt? - No, I'm all right. It's nothing.
2289	2291	See who's at the door.
2294	2298	What's happening? Elizabeth and your father are coming to see you.
2298	2299	- Keep them out. - Too late!
2299	2302	They must not see that. Here, quick, give me a hand.
2302	2304	Quick!
2318	2323	Henry, hurry, get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here.
2331	2333	Well, er...
2333	2336	Pretty sort of place for my son to be in, I must say.
2337	2340	- Is that the front door? - Yes, this is it.
2340	2342	Right.
2342	2344	I don't like it, but...
2345	2347	here goes.
2349	2351	(tuts)
2352	2354	There doesn't seem to be anybody in the place.
2358	2360	God...
2364	2367	What a... What a forsaken place.
2367	2370	Are you trying to burn it down, eh? What's that for, eh?
2370	2374	Well, what's the matter with you? You look as if you've been kicked by a horse.
2375	2376	- Where's Henry? - Why...
2377	2379	- Well? - He can't be disturbed just now.
2379	2382	Oh, can't he? Huh! I'll soon settle that nonsense.
2382	2384	Victor, where is he?
2384	2386	This place seems to drive everybody crazy.
2387	2389	- (banging) - Oh, heavens... What's that?
2389	2392	I beg your pardon. I am Dr Waldman.
2393	2396	Oh, are you? I'm Baron Frankenstein.
2396	2399	Perhaps you know what all this tommyrot's about.
2399	2402	I... (splutters) I'll be shot if I do!
2402	2405	I advise you to take Henry away from here at once.
2405	2408	Well, what do you suppose I'm here for? Pleasure?
2408	2409	Nah.
2409	2411	Where are you, my dear? Oh, there you are.
2412	2414	Let's see what's up the awful stairs.
2414	2417	I don't know how the deuce I'm going to get up 'em, but...
2417	2420	(Baron mutters)
2420	2422	Leave them alone.
2422	2426	No banisters or anything else... How much further?
2429	2431	Come in.
2433	2435	- Henry. - Elizabeth.
2438	2440	Henry!
2441	2444	Victor! Dr Waldman! Come quickly.
2444	2449	- My dear, what have they done to you? - Poor Fritz... It's all my fault...
2449	2451	Get him on the sofa.
2461	2463	Have you got any brandy?
2466	2468	Quick, quick, quick.
2471	2473	Here, I'll do that.
2474	2475	My boy... Now, now...
2476	2477	Now drink. Drink this.
2480	2483	There. There, that's better.
2483	2486	I'm going to take you home with me, Henry.
2486	2490	No, I can't. My work. What will happen to the records of my experiment?
2490	2492	- We will preserve them. - And...
2492	2495	I will see that it is painlessly destroyed.
2495	2497	Yes, yes. Leave it all to me.
2497	2500	Poor Fritz. All my fault.
2500	2502	There, Henry. You can't do any more now.
2502	2505	You must come home until you get well again.
2505	2508	You'll soon feel better when you get out of here.
2585	2587	(gags)
2590	2592	(chokes)
2638	2640	It's like heaven being with you again.
2641	2643	Heaven wasn't so far away all the time, you know.
2643	2646	I know. But I didn't realise it.
2647	2651	My work. Those horrible days and nights.
2652	2654	I couldn't think of anything else.
2654	2657	Henry, you're not to think of those things any more.
2658	2660	- You promised. - All right.
2660	2664	Let's think about us. When will our wedding be?
2667	2669	Let's make it soon.
2669	2671	As soon as you like.
2678	2680	For three generations,
2680	2684	these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings.
2684	2687	Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.
2688	2691	Looks as good as new now, hey?
2691	2696	And here. Here is one to make the best man look still better.
2697	2702	30 years ago, I placed this on your mother's head, Henry.
2703	2708	Today, you'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth.
2708	2711	And I hope, in 30 years' time,
2711	2715	a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.
2715	2719	And now, how about a little drink, eh?
2720	2724	My grandfather bought this wine and laid it down.
2725	2730	My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it. Bless her heart.
2730	2732	Here's to your very good health.
2732	2735	Well, are you all full? Yes? Come along.
2735	2740	Here's a health to a son of the House of Frankenstein.
2740	2742	(all) A son to the House of Frankenstein.
2744	2747	Here's a jolly good health to young Frankenstein.
2747	2749	(all) Young Frankenstein.
2752	2756	Give the servants some champagne. This stuff's wasted on 'em.
2757	2759	Well, well, well.
2762	2765	(Baron) Go on, mop it up. It'll do you good.
2765	2769	- House of Frankenstein. - To the House of Frankenstein.
2770	2772	Now then. Now be off about your business.
2778	2782	- (merriment outside) - Listen! Listen to 'em!
2782	2786	The boys and girls of the village are out here.
2791	2793	(cheering and singing)
2799	2802	It's extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people
2802	2805	on a couple of bottles of beer.
2805	2807	Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.
2807	2809	No doubt!
2809	2812	- They're calling for you, Baron. - Hey-ho.
2812	2815	Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.
2815	2818	(cheering)
2820	2823	Quiet!
2823	2825	Thank you all very much indeed.
2825	2828	I'm very pleased to see you all, and I hope there's plenty of beer.
2829	2831	There's lots more where that came from.
2831	2833	(cheering)
2867	2871	You stay here, Maria. I'll just take a look at my traps.
2871	2874	Then we'll go to the village and have a grand time, huh?
2874	2876	- You won't be long, Daddy? - Oh, no.
2876	2879	If Franz comes by, tell him I'll be back soon.
2880	2882	Daddy, won't you stay and play with me a little while?
2883	2885	I'm too busy, darling.
2885	2887	You stay and play with the kitty, huh?
2888	2890	- Bye, Daddy. - Goodbye.
2890	2892	Be a good girl now.
2893	2895	Come on, kitty.
2925	2928	Who are you? I'm Maria.
2929	2931	Will you play with me?
2946	2948	Would you like one of my flowers?
2972	2975	You have those, and I'll have these.
2981	2983	I can make a boat.
2987	2989	See how mine float?
2999	3001	Ohh!
3009	3012	No, you're hurting me! No!
3035	3037	(? Bavarian folk music)
3081	3084	- Henry. - Elizabeth!
3085	3088	How lovely you look. But you shouldn't be here.
3089	3091	I must see you for a minute.
3095	3097	Why? What's the matter?
3102	3104	Could you leave us for a moment?
3105	3107	Why, of course.
3115	3117	- Why, what is it? - I'm so glad you're safe.
3117	3119	Safe? Of course I'm safe.
3119	3123	But you look worried. Is anything wrong?
3123	3124	No.
3124	3127	No, forget my foolishness.
3127	3129	It was just a mood. There's nothing the matter.
3129	3131	Of course there isn't!
3132	3135	Henry, I'm afraid. Terribly afraid.
3136	3138	Where is Dr Waldman? Why is he late for the wedding?
3139	3141	He's always late. He'll be here soon.
3142	3144	Something is going to happen.
3144	3147	I feel it. I can't get it out of my mind.
3147	3150	You're just nervous.
3150	3152	All the excitement and preparation.
3152	3157	No. No, it isn't that. I've felt it all day.
3158	3160	Something is coming between us.
3160	3163	I know it. I know it!
3163	3166	Sit down and rest. You look so tired.
3167	3172	- If I could just save us from it. - From what, dear? From what?
3173	3175	I don't know!
3175	3179	If I could just get it out of my mind! I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.
3179	3182	Lose me? Why, I'll always be with you.
3182	3185	Will you, Henry? Are you sure?
3186	3188	I love you so.
3188	3192	Sure. How beautiful you look.
3193	3195	Henry! Henry! (knocking at door)
3195	3198	What's that? What's that?!
3198	3200	Henry! Dr Waldman!
3201	3204	- What about Dr Waldman? - Henry, don't leave me!
3204	3208	- No, darling, you stay here. - Henry! Henry!
3209	3211	Dr Waldman's been murdered in the tower.
3211	3211	The monster.
3212	3215	He's been seen in the hills, terrorising the mountainside.
3215	3216	(moaning)
3216	3218	He's in the house.
3219	3221	He's upstairs!
3224	3226	(bells ring out)
3226	3228	(agitated shouting outside)
3247	3248	(moaning)
3248	3251	It's in the cellars.
3285	3286	(moans)
3286	3288	(screams)
3288	3290	- (mimics scream) - (screams)
3294	3297	(Elizabeth continues screaming)
3298	3300	It's Elizabeth! Come on.
3307	3308	(clattering)
3314	3316	Elizabeth!
3316	3318	What is it?
3322	3325	- Don't let him come here. - No, no, no, darling. It's all right.
3325	3330	- Don't let him come here. - It's all right, darling. It's all right.
3343	3345	Oh, look! That's Maria!
3348	3350	(cheering)
3407	3410	Silence! Silence! Silence!
3410	3412	What is it?
3412	3415	Maria. She's drowned.
3416	3419	My poor man. Why do you bring her here to me?
3420	3422	But... But she has been murdered.
3422	3424	(shouting)
3427	3430	Silence! I'll see that justice is done.
3430	3432	Who is it?
3441	3444	- How is Elizabeth now? - I don't know.
3444	3448	She's still in a daze. Just looks at me and says nothing. It's maddening.
3448	3451	Easy, old man. She'll be all right.
3451	3453	- Our wedding day. - Steady.
3453	3455	Your wedding will be postponed a day at most.
3455	3459	- A day? I wonder. - What do you mean?
3459	3463	There can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.
3463	3467	I made him with these hands, and with these hands I will destroy him.
3467	3469	- I must find him! - I'll go with you.
3469	3472	No. You stay here and look after Elizabeth.
3472	3477	I'll leave her in your care, whatever happens. You understand? In your care.
3482	3483	(angry shouting)
3485	3489	Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
3490	3491	Ludwig.
3491	3495	You will search the woods. Those are your group.
3495	3498	- We'll get him! - Quiet!
3498	3500	Herr Frankenstein.
3500	3504	You will take to the mountains. Those are your people.
3505	3508	I... I will lead the third group by the lake.
3509	3514	And remember... remember... get him alive if you can,
3514	3516	but get him!
3517	3521	Quiet! Search every ravine, every crevasse,
3521	3523	but the fiend must be found!
3525	3527	Are you ready?
3527	3530	Light your torches and go!
3595	3596	Stop!
3596	3598	Frankenstein, mountains!
3598	3600	Ludwig!
3600	3602	Lake party, this way!
3641	3643	Come on, boys! Keep together.
3643	3646	You search there. The rest, come with me.
3660	3661	(yells)
3661	3664	Look lively! Come on! Come on!
3667	3669	Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!
3670	3672	(moaning)
3675	3678	Come on, men! Quick! This way!
3683	3687	Which way did he go? Which way did he go? Tell me! Tell me!
3687	3688	Over there.
3688	3690	You stay here and take care of him.
3690	3694	The rest, follow me. Come on! Come on, quick!
3714	3717	No, come back! This way.
3730	3732	Herr Frankenstein!
3732	3735	Herr Frankenstein, where are you?
3737	3740	I think he's up there. Come on, follow me.
3740	3742	Quick!
3753	3755	Hello!
3762	3764	Fire. Fire!
3766	3768	Help! Help!
3771	3773	- Listen. - (Herr Frankenstein) Help!
3773	3776	It's Frankenstein.
3776	3778	That way!
3802	3804	This way! Come on, hurry! Hurry!
3807	3810	Look, they're there! Turn the hounds loose!
3881	3883	(yells)
3897	3898	(yells)
3920	3922	There he is! The murderer.
3960	3962	He's alive.
3962	3964	Frankenstein!
3965	3967	Frankenstein.
3969	3972	Bring him down to the village and let's take him home.
3975	3977	Murderer!
3982	3984	Burn the mill!
3993	3996	Burn the mill! He can't get away!
4005	4007	(screams)
4028	4031	(continues screaming)
4040	4041	Aaagh!
4048	4050	(hounds howling)
4064	4067	Have you got it? Come on, hurry.
4067	4069	(whispering and giggling)
4075	4077	Quiet, quiet.
4078	4081	Well, go ahead and knock.
4087	4090	Well, well, well, what's all this?
4090	4092	What do you want, hey?
4093	4094	What's this?
4094	4096	If you please, Herr Baron,
4096	4101	we thought that Mr Henry could do with a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.
4101	4104	Fine old lady, my grandmother.
4105	4110	Very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this.
4117	4120	Mr Henry doesn't need this.
4122	4124	As I said before, I say again,
4125	4129	here's to a son to the House of Frankenstein.
4129	4132	(all) Yes, indeed, sir. We hope so, sir.
