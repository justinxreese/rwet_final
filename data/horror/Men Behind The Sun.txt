37	42	original site and ruins of Manchu 731
42	48	Ping Fang District, Harbin, China
55	58	Prior to the Second World War
65	68	the Japanese Militarists had occupied N.E. China
68	70	& established the puppet state Manchoukou
71	74	ln order to expand their Greater East Asia Empire
74	76	the Japanese did a lot of preparatory work.
76	79	Some of the least known work
79	81	were the experiments on bacterial weapons.
82	85	by the Manchu 731 Squadron
88	90	This Squadron 731 had many Sub-Sections
92	96	They were: Helier,
96	99	Sun Wu,
100	102	Lion Kou,
102	104	Mu Dan Jiang,
105	107	and An Da Rural Experimental Station.
109	112	The main offices of 731
112	115	were situated in a residential district of Harbin
115	118	They covered a large area of land
118	120	The headquarters were highly classified,
122	125	and surrounded by a high tension electric fence.
126	128	lnside there were extensive facilities,
128	130	there was an animal farm,
131	133	a crematorium,
133	135	a pathology laboratory, a jail,
136	138	an electricity generating plant,
138	139	the commanders quarters,
140	142	& other sections for various experimental projects.
142	144	By February 1945
145	147	the Japanese forces were suffering losses on the battle front
148	150	to win the war by biological warfare
150	153	the Military Headquarters reinstated a Lt. General to be the Squadron commander.
154	156	Yet this person had previously been relieved off this post because of corruption.
157	160	This man, the inventor of the lshit Water Purifier
161	163	a military medical doctor, Lt. lshii Shiro.
164	166	A group of young soldiers were sent to Harbin to provide new blood for this squadron.
167	170	The banks of Song Hua River,
178	181	When will they come to pick us up?
182	183	Captain Takehara's gone to Bai Hua Liao
184	185	to find our new sergeant.
186	187	He's been gone for almost an hour.
188	190	Why aren't we allowed to go to Bai Hua Liao?
190	192	This place is freezing cold
193	195	Yes, it's similar to Chiba Prefecture
195	197	l think it's much colder here
198	200	lshikawa, don't you think so?
200	202	lt makes no difference,
203	205	we aren't going home anyway.
205	206	Look!
207	210	lshikawa already misses home after leaving Mom for a few days.
210	212	He is just a Momma's boy,
213	215	he even broke down & cried when his mom saw him off.
216	218	But you cried too!
219	221	No. l didn't!
221	222	But my mom & sister did.
222	224	Yes my mom cried too.
224	226	l didn't cry.
226	227	but l felt really bad.
227	229	My father was killed fighting in China.
230	231	So was mine!
231	232	So were my father and my elder brother,
232	234	they died fighting in China.
298	301	This kind of food is even hard to get back home in our Japan.
301	303	Did you know that?
304	306	Drag him out!
307	312	Yeah! Stuff it in!
408	410	The original building housing
410	413	the Manchu 731 Squadron.
442	443	General,
443	445	Doctor lshii's arrived at the H.Q.,
445	446	would you...
446	448	Yeah, l'm coming.
458	459	lshikawa,
459	461	Catch the ball!
462	464	Dr. lshii!
466	470	General Kikuchi.
474	477	You still look like the same great lshii.
478	480	Squadron 731's lshii.
481	489	Welcome back, lshii!
495	498	Lt. General lshii's returned to the corps!
507	509	ldiots! Listen!
509	512	l'm the new Section Head, Captain Kawasaki.
512	514	From now on you are in the Kwangtung Army,
515	518	members of the 731 Squadron Youth Corps!
518	521	lf you get the chance to go to Harbin,
521	524	weather you leave or your day off,
524	526	you must change into civilian clothes before leaving,
526	529	& when you return,
529	532	put your uniforms back on at Bai Hua Liao.
532	534	lf you run into any other Japanese
534	536	or if you are stopped by a patrol,
536	539	you will not reveal your secondment to this squadron.
539	541	ls that clear?
542	543	Yes, Sir!
550	556	Crematorium
579	582	lt's almost three years since 1942
583	585	A toast to you and your brothers reunion.
587	589	Cheers!
591	593	Thank you, Sir.
597	599	Now, Gentleman,
599	603	l've not been here for the last couple of years
603	606	but l know all about what has been going on here.
606	609	l've looked into the research done by Mr. Kitano
609	611	and l think it has been handled wrongly.
612	614	What we need most now
614	618	is to increase the production & the number of bacteria.
619	621	We must use bacterial weapons in the war
621	623	to speed our victory.
623	625	A toast to victory!
625	626	To the empire!
626	627	To victory
627	628	And to Mr. lshii for leading 731!
628	629	Cheers!, Cheers!
630	631	Sir!
633	634	Lt. General sir.
635	639	Lt. Onoe Shunji reporting for duty from the Kwangtung Army Commanders office.
639	640	Lt. General?
641	644	l should have been a full general!
644	645	l don't understand
645	650	Why those idiots at the Central Planning Office decline that army doctors can go no higher than Lt. General.
650	651	lt's ridiculous!
655	656	Lt. Onoe!
656	659	l've just made a criticism against the Central Planning Office
660	662	would you inform on me?
669	670	Stop!
671	672	Have you no respect for your seniors?
690	692	Forget it, let’s go back!
692	694	We'll be in trouble if we are discovered.
694	695	No!
696	698	My brother gave me that ball when l left Japan.
774	776	Get up! out of your beds!
780	782	Where's Hoshino and lshikawa?
782	783	l don't know.
783	784	l don't either.
785	787	Ono... where's he gone to?
789	790	l don't know!
817	820	Animal Breeding Unit
958	960	Hoshino!
961	963	Don't run!
978	979	Hoshino!
980	982	Stop running! Hoshino...
1006	1008	That was totally undisciplined
1009	1011	that must never be repeated.
1012	1013	The training of the Youth Corps is important.
1014	1016	lt's not only because we are short of staff
1016	1019	it's also because what we require here
1020	1022	are people of the highest integrity.
1022	1024	Headquarters only recognizes the importance
1024	1026	of bacterial weapons in this war.
1027	1029	The fail to realize that biological & chemical weapons
1030	1032	will greatly affect the future of Japan.
1033	1035	They will play a very important role.
1035	1037	So we must work doubly hard on these experiments.
1037	1038	Yes, sir!
1039	1041	That was really unexpected.
1042	1044	We have to step up security and discipline.
1045	1047	lt's late. l'd better leave you two to talk!
1054	1056	Brother, please sit down!
1065	1066	Shiro,
1067	1070	what's happening back in Chiba Prefecture?
1075	1077	There's shortage of everything
1077	1079	but people are managing
1080	1082	People have suffered a lot these past few years.
1082	1084	We can only do our best, brother
1085	1087	How are things here?
1087	1089	What about the men's morale?
1090	1091	Not too bad,
1091	1093	things are all right.
1093	1095	Also we confirmed that the incident
1096	1097	which got you relieved
1097	1099	was due to an informer.
1100	1102	lt was Lt. Colonel Nakatome who reported you
1102	1105	He even ridiculed the effectiveness of your water purifier.
1105	1108	Nakatome! Goddamn him!
1125	1126	Attention
1127	1128	Nakatome! Lt. Colonel Nakatome present!
1159	1161	Lt. General lshii wants you!
1253	1255	Kawasaki, any absentees?
1258	1259	Unfortunately
1260	1261	we had an accident just now.
1267	1269	l want you to treat those kids from Chiba gently.
1270	1273	They are important to us
1273	1275	Thank you!
1282	1283	Damn you!
1284	1286	Hashino brought about his own death
1287	1289	and you are acting like a bunch of school girls.
1290	1292	What kind of soldiers are you?
1293	1295	How can you gain honor for Chiba like this?
1295	1297	Soldiers shouldn't act like this!
1298	1300	Quick, close ranks!
1302	1305	Everybody down, prone position, crawl!
1373	1375	Assholes, quick!
1389	1391	Stand up!
1392	1394	Attention!
1430	1433	l heard that the fighting is very heavy on the southern front,
1433	1435	our whole army could possibly be wiped out!
1439	1441	lt sounds serious.
1441	1443	We have to push our people
1443	1445	to speed up the experiments on the marut
1445	1447	These biological weapons
1447	1449	are the only way to turn the war in our favor.
1449	1451	What did they say?
1451	1453	lt sounded like little Japan is finished!
1455	1456	Let’s go!
1463	1464	Wait!
1467	1469	Sir, please!
1471	1473	Give me back my baby!
1482	1484	My baby, my baby... please give her back to me!
1513	1515	Sir, didn't General lshii tell us that
1515	1517	we are supposed to conservatively use the "marut"?
1518	1520	This one can be stuffed and mounted, it won't be wasted.
1523	1525	February 29, 1945
1525	1527	Victim: Zhao Qing, Han Chinese, 3 month old
1551	1553	Oh water!
1557	1559	Water's coming out!
1574	1576	lt's really tough.
1576	1578	Thank god the money is Al right.
1579	1580	also l can study.
1581	1583	do you send money home?
1583	1584	No.
1585	1587	Come on, you spend it all every month!
1587	1589	No, mom said l must have it for the war efforts.
1590	1592	This is a nice place!
1593	1595	it's similar to Chiba Prefecture.
1595	1597	Chiba is not that cold
1597	1599	this is like a hospital.
1600	1602	l say it's not
1602	1604	We only have dead bodies here
1605	1607	hospitals should have patients
1607	1609	this is more like a medical school
1609	1611	Anyway this is fine by me
1612	1613	l eat well and l can make money
1614	1616	The only thing is this fat Captain
1616	1618	Look, isn't that Hoshino's ball?
1619	1622	Get it back!
1623	1625	Come on, let’s get it back!
1628	1630	Let's get it back!
1648	1650	Stop!
1651	1653	There's nowhere to run!
1653	1655	Give the ball back to us!
1662	1664	This is not Hoshino's ball!
1666	1668	Who are you? What are you doing here?
1672	1674	He is a mute!
1721	1723	Hold on a minute!
1727	1729	What is wrong with him?
1729	1731	He's been here for over a month,
1732	1734	but he's still not adjusted to this place yet.
1734	1736	He vomits every time he goes to work.
1736	1737	When it happens
1737	1739	we have to let him take a break
1739	1742	it will take him a while to get used to it!
1742	1745	That's O.K., he'll soon get used to it!
1745	1747	His job is important!
1747	1750	we rely on the colors to determine the results of the experiments
1750	1752	we can't depend totally on black and white pictures.
1753	1755	Look after him, see that he works well!
1756	1757	Sir!
1762	1764	Lt. Col. Nakatome Jiro
1764	1768	l've been transferred to the southern front by order of the Kwangtung Army Commander
1768	1769	l'd like to say goodbye sir.
1770	1772	Congratulations,
1772	1775	the situation in the south is serious,
1775	1778	a patriotic soldier like you
1778	1780	should be able to achieve a lot here
1781	1783	especially as you have a close relationship with the planning office
1783	1784	you can do a lot for the war effort!
1784	1786	Yes, Sir!
1795	1797	This must be your arrangement.
1806	1807	This marut
1807	1809	has been injected with plague three times.
1809	1811	But no symptoms have appeared.
1811	1813	So now let’s conduct live dissection on him, & see what's so special about him.
1813	1814	Good!
1815	1817	The correct data,
1817	1820	relies on continuous tests on experimental subjects
1820	1822	so these maruts,
1822	1824	not only have to be alive,
1825	1827	but they also have to be fit and healthy.
1827	1829	experiments on such live subjects
1829	1831	is a rare opportunity.
1842	1843	What is this?
1843	1845	lt's a man!
1853	1853	What is this?
1854	1855	He's a Chinese man.
1865	1867	What is this?
1867	1869	He is a bad Chinese man!
1874	1876	This is a marut.
1876	1878	lt is a log for the fire or making coffins,
1879	1881	it is material for experiment.
1881	1882	lt is called a "Marut"
1882	1884	What is this?
1885	1886	This is a marut.
1887	1888	What is this?
1889	1890	A Marut!
1892	1893	What is this?
1894	1895	A Marut!
1899	1901	What is this?
1902	1907	A Marut!
1908	1921	Beat him!
1924	1926	We must try to get evidence
1927	1929	& get it out of here
1929	1931	so the outside world knows what's going on in here.
1931	1933	lt's the only thing we can do!
1948	1951	Look, why go through all that trouble?
1952	1953	say we have no chance of getting out here!
1955	1957	You chicken! You have no back-bone!
1957	1959	and you... learn to be a man. Don't copy him.
1960	1962	You don't act like a Chinese!
1967	1970	Beyond Practice Ground
1985	1987	Order arms!
1988	1990	At ease!
1992	1994	The lessons on experiments will start tomorrow,
1995	1997	so work hard men, & learn well,
1997	1998	is that clear?
1998	1999	Yes, sir!
2010	2012	Sir, please!
2013	2014	let her carry it away
2015	2016	it’s her baby!
2025	2026	Let's go!
2030	2031	Please, Sir!
2038	2040	Bacterial Extermination Room
2055	2057	Quickly change your clothes!
2057	2058	Hurry up!
2069	2071	Let's go!
2077	2079	March 9, 1945
2080	2082	Outdoor Frostbite Experimental Station
2083	2085	Victim: Zhao Hui Xiu, Han Chinese, 24 years old
2220	2222	Bacteria Breeding Room
2223	2225	Look, this is the "gene" production room.
2230	2232	This is the high temperature bacteria exterminating room.
2258	2260	Look this way please,
2261	2263	this is the bacteria transplants,
2264	2266	you must study hard and learn all this as soon as possible.
2266	2267	Yes, Sir!
2267	2269	Frostbite Experimental Room
2280	2282	This is the cold treatment station
2285	2288	At -35°C for 10 hours Cold Treatment
2289	2291	Water temperature 15°C.
2328	2329	March 9, 1945
2330	2332	Victim: Jin Yuan Long, Manchurian, 31years old
2342	2343	What you are looking at now,
2344	2346	is a quick freezing station, it is -196°C.
2372	2374	Finish chewing your apple,
2374	2376	& spit it out like l do.
2377	2379	Don't swallow it.
2379	2381	This way you can
2381	2383	collect the germs from the mouth.
2383	2384	Yes, Sir!
2391	2393	Go back and tell your captain,
2393	2395	that you’ll be my guests this Sunday,
2395	2397	we'll have drinks together.
2397	2398	Yes Sir!
2400	2402	And you’ll come too, O.K.?
2404	2406	O.K.
2408	2410	Thank you!
2420	2422	This is a question of humanity.
2422	2423	No!
2424	2427	This concerns the rise or fall of the Great Japanese Empire.
2427	2429	Listen lshikawa, they are human beings too,
2429	2431	they have parents just like you!
2432	2434	What are you talking about?
2434	2437	Give me better justification than that!
2437	2438	Today is Sunday
2438	2440	let’s not talk about business,
2440	2441	come on lets eat up.
2442	2444	This fruit is specially brought over from Japan.
2444	2445	Help yourselves.
2446	2448	Let me, you must look after your health.
2454	2456	Take Mrs. Takamura for example,
2456	2458	what's the difference between the children she bore
2458	2460	& the maruts?
2461	2463	What are you talking about?
2463	2465	That's not right!
2465	2467	You can not compare the maruts to the Japanese,
2468	2470	you & l speak a different language.
2470	2472	Please don't say anymore
2473	2475	l'm sorry, please excuse me.
2482	2484	lshikawa, wait!
2573	2575	lshikawa, lshikawa!
2581	2583	Kawasaki pushed him... from upstairs!
2583	2585	He's badly hurt,
2585	2587	let’s think of a way to teach Kawasaki a lesson.
2588	2590	l hope you'll work well together.
2590	2592	To be a member of the 731 Youth Corps
2593	2594	we should...
2594	2596	obey the regulations.
2596	2598	l think you'd better forget about it.
2599	2600	Don't pretend now,
2600	2602	you have no guts.
2609	2611	Coward. Stop pretending!
2638	2640	April 11, 1945
2681	2683	Those goddamned Japs...
2683	2685	What the hell are they up to?
2686	2686	Hey Specs!
2687	2689	What do you think the Japs will do to us?
2705	2707	What did they inject into us this morning?
2707	2709	l have no reaction at all!
2710	2712	l have no idea what it was.
2715	2717	Why didn't those people get it too?
2739	2741	Be careful of contamination!
2741	2743	the last accident cost Sakagami & Ohtani their lives,
2744	2746	so be careful everyone.
2765	2767	Sir, according to the previous test results,
2767	2769	it would be a rather difficult job to produce a Black Death Virus
2770	2771	that is 60times stronger.
2777	2779	Now this is the 7th experiment,
2779	2781	here is the record for the last few tests!
2783	2785	Sir, l've heard the Germans are using the Jews to perform similar kinds of tests
2785	2787	and they’ve achieved good results,
2788	2790	so can't we...
2792	2795	Dr. lshii did 2years research on this in Europe before the war.
2795	2798	According to him, the German researches into that area are fare behind ours.
2799	2802	Compared to this, their equipment & facilities are fare behind ours
2802	2808	What they achieved so far may not be of any use for us.
2809	2811	Don't be discouraged, keep up the good work,
2811	2814	report to me at once when the experiments are completed.
2817	2820	Yes sir, l heard that Lt. Colonel Nakatome died in action on the southern front, is that right?
2828	2830	Dr. lshii may have been too...
2834	2837	We'd better keep out of that,
2838	2839	You'd better concentrate on your own career.
2840	2843	The Empire Medical Department is waiting for your return.
2844	2846	The medical future of Japan relies on you people.
2855	2857	Early summer 1945
2858	2860	Japanese were retreating from the Pacific Front
2860	2863	They also suffered many losses in China.
2864	2867	The moral of the Japanese troops was very bad.
2867	2871	All of Japan had been mobilized,
2872	2875	there were still great shortages of everything.
2875	2878	A large deficit of manpower for the Japanese
2879	2881	military resulted in more adolescents joining
2881	2884	the forces. The cloud of defeat loomed larger
2884	2887	ln other words, the success or failure of 731
2887	2890	decides the survival of the Empire.
2890	2892	So today...
2893	2896	we should have no more illusions about the Kwangtung Army,
2897	2899	the Kwangtung Army relies on our bacterial war,
2899	2902	there is no other way of winning it.
2902	2905	l've always thought that biological weapons are more effective than bombers and guns
2906	2908	Right now we must regroup our forces,
2908	2911	& mobilize them.
2911	2914	l entreat you to work doubly hard
2915	2917	We must get ourselves well prepared for the coming bacterial war.
2918	2921	Gentleman, do you have any questions?
2926	2928	Please, go ahead!
2930	2932	We have already successfully produced
2932	2934	a large quantity of virus which is 60times stronger than the Black Death Virus.
2935	2937	The amount of culture we have,
2938	2940	according to our calculations,
2940	2943	has enough power to wipe out the whole mankind.
2944	2946	At the same time
2947	2949	we have increased the number
2949	2951	of bacteria carrying rats to three million,
2952	2954	& jumping fleas to 300 kilos.
2955	2957	The number is estimated at 10 billion,
2958	2960	if this 10 billion bacteria carrying fleas
2960	2962	were all released, then it's not hard to imagine
2963	2966	the situation on the war front would change drastically,
2967	2969	we would gain the final victory!
2970	2971	Because of the bacterial weapons
2972	2974	the fate of the Great Japanese Empire
2974	2976	lies in our hands.
2976	2978	Still after numerous experiments
2978	2980	the metal shell casings holding the bacteria
2981	2982	get very hot during firing.
2982	2983	And a majority of the infected fleas inside get killed
2984	2986	so these bacterial bombs have failed to produce the expected results.
2986	2987	Weapons Production Department...
2990	2991	Anything else?
2993	2995	Sir, there's been a strong reaction to the incident
2996	2997	when Kawasaki assaulted the Youth Corps member
2998	3000	and it's getting to be quite serious.
3001	3003	There's a lot of tension & unrest amongst the Corps.
3004	3006	Transfer Kawasaki from the Youth Corps.
3007	3008	Onoe you'll replace him.
3009	3010	Yes, Sir!
3011	3013	Sukizan Geisha House
3016	3018	Sorry to disturb you,
3033	3036	General, it seems your sword's not rusted yet!
3041	3043	Get out both of you!
3044	3046	Yes, Sir!
3224	3230	Whoever... was hit or touched by the chess pieces, raise your hands.
3241	3243	Gentlemen.
3244	3247	This is... my new invention.
3248	3250	This... is called Low Temperature Pottery...
3250	3252	Bacterial Bomb!
3286	3289	The Great Japan will not be defeated!
3297	3300	Careful! Don't break the pottery bomb!
3330	3332	May 22, 1945
3332	3335	An Da Rural Experimental Station
3335	3338	Victims: Names unknown, 29 males and females

3379	3382	Victim: Qu Hua, Han Chinese, 34 years old
3490	3492	not a female "maruta"
3492	3495	Kawasaki, l want you to bring me a healthy young man.
3497	3499	What's the use of a healthy young man?
3499	3501	lt's of no use for you,
3501	3503	but it's of great use for us.
3503	3504	Please help us get one!
3505	3506	Kawasaki,
3506	3508	if you can help us find a healthy young man,
3508	3510	then i'll buy you a drink.
3511	3512	Right, we'll all buy you a drink.
3512	3515	Kawasaki's good at that.
3515	3517	l'm sorry, l can't help you with that.
3518	3519	Kawasaki's only good at finding girls!
3520	3522	That's nonsense!
3525	3527	Come on Kawasaki!
3527	3529	Do something for us.
3530	3531	We'll reward you. Please!
3532	3534	O.K., l'll try.
3535	3537	June 12, 1945
3537	3539	Poison Gas Laboratory
3540	3544	Victim: Natashalvanova, White Russia, 35 years old
3549	3552	You can do what ever you want with me!
3552	3554	Let my daughter go, please!
3555	3557	Please, l beg you, let her go!
3563	3566	Please!
3684	3687	You've been here a while, are you used to it?
3688	3689	Yes, sir, l am!
3692	3694	Do you still see that Chinese mute?
3694	3696	Not very often, sir!
3697	3699	Do you think you can find him for me?
3699	3700	What for, sir?
3728	3730	Sir, l've brought you the mute.
3731	3733	Thank you, well done.
3735	3737	Don't be afraid!
3752	3754	Let him in.
3757	3761	Come here, come inside.
3764	3766	You wait here,
3767	3768	When the surgery is finished,
3769	3771	you can take him away.
3771	3773	Surgery? What surgery?
3774	3775	No questions!
3775	3777	Keep your nose out of these things.
3801	3803	Come here!
3804	3806	Go on!
3820	3822	Come here!
4006	4008	Where are you going?
4009	4010	Surgery is finished! Take him away! Quickly!
4011	4012	Yes sir!
4016	4018	Are you satisfied now?
4019	4021	Each of you got what you wanted... the heart...
4022	4022	the liver,
4023	4023	and the brain.
4024	4026	these organs from a living healthy young man in puberty,
4027	4029	are difficult to come by!
4030	4032	We should thank Kawasaki.
4036	4038	Don't mention it!
4039	4041	We'll invite you to dinner this evening.
4041	4043	Thank you! Thank you!
4043	4046	What's wrong with you? Quickly push the cart away!
4047	4049	Yes, sir!
4050	4052	July 2, 1945
4052	4054	Victim: A mute, name unknown, Han Chinese
4056	4058	Tunnel connecting Pathology Lab to Crematorium
4129	4132	Makimura, draw the curtains.
4137	4139	That fat ass is a barbarian.
4140	4142	Come here, that mute was not amarut
4146	4148	That animal has gone too far!
4148	4150	Yeah, l have always detested him.
4150	4152	Let's find a way to fix him!
4152	4154	What do you think?
4155	4161	l want to kill him. lf there's a problem, l take responsibility!
4162	4165	No, we are all in this together!
4179	4181	Hurry up!
4184	4186	Ready for disinfection?
4209	4211	What are you doing here? Get back!
4367	4369	A smart rat can beat a cat.
4369	4372	Fleas & germs can defeat bombers and guns too!
4372	4375	This is... my theory behind 731 Squadron.
4375	4377	lt's also my philosophy.
4378	4380	For Victory,
4380	4382	we shall groom the strongest and nurture them,
4383	4384	the same applies for the Youth Corps.
4385	4386	Understand?
4393	4395	Stone, stone!
4403	4405	Stone, wait!
4408	4410	You must get out of here alive!
4410	4412	No matter what happens,
4413	4415	we must get the evidence out!
4416	4417	Stone, quick!
4418	4419	Release him!
4419	4421	Get in the hole you bastard!
4421	4423	Stone won't follow a coward like you...
4423	4425	Stone won't go into anything blindly with you
4425	4427	The door is open!
4433	4436	Stone!
4440	4443	Fire!
4444	4446	Charge, charge!
4448	4450	Stone, watch where you are going!
4450	4451	Fire!
4451	4453	Get down quick!
4476	4478	ldiots!
4478	4480	So many maruts are dead,
4481	4483	this is a serious matter.
4483	4485	Do you realize your job
4485	4487	is to keep them in good shape,
4487	4489	so they can live longer
4489	4491	But you neglected your duties,
4491	4493	with very serious consequences.
4493	4494	Your error is intolerable
4494	4496	& unforgivable!
4496	4499	Maruts are precious experimental material.
4499	4502	they mean more to us than ever...
4503	4505	You have no right to kill them.
4508	4510	The Russo-Japanese war is coming,
4510	4512	but many of our experiments
4513	4515	have not been completed yet.
4515	4517	The 731 Squdron is our nation's hope,
4518	4521	we hold the power to turn the war in our favour and save Japan.
4522	4524	Get up now!
4524	4526	l hope you won’t forget,
4527	4529	that l was the one who brought you here from Chiba.
4532	4535	Takamura at An Da Rural Station
4535	4538	is preparing for the final pottery shell tests.
4539	4542	Have the Maruts gone yet?
4544	4546	They left early this morning, sir!
4567	4569	Specs said,
4569	4571	that what you did was stupid.
4572	4575	We can't get out of here anyway.
4575	4578	The more we resist, the faster we get killed.
4579	4582	He said the only thing we can do is to try &
4582	4584	get the evidence out.
4585	4587	So the world will know about this hell hole.
4587	4590	Dr. lshii, we're running out of time,
4590	4592	The situation at the front is very bad.
4593	4596	Looks like this is the final straw for us.
4597	4597	The trip to Feng Tiang
4598	4600	is very important, don't worry about things here.
4607	4609	Thank you, l rely on you.
4617	4618	Report, sir!
4619	4620	lnform the air corps to take off now!
4621	4623	Preparations are complete at the shell test site.
4624	4626	Come in... we haven't contacted them yet.
4626	4627	Right...
4628	4630	Let's go to the upper.
4630	4632	Fire the signal!
4633	4636	Let's move!
4651	4653	We need the Maruts urgently.
4654	4656	Are they on their way or not!
4656	4657	Reporting, Sir!
4661	4663	Excuse me sir, urgent telegram.
4664	4666	You may go.
4677	4680	August 9th, Nagasaki was bombed.
4681	4683	The Russians have officially declared war.
4683	4685	Manchuria 731 Sqdn. retreat if necessary.
4686	4688	Go to Feng Tian and get the commander here!
4690	4692	Stop the delivery of Maruts.
4695	4699	Hello!
4703	4705	Hello Airport!
4710	4712	Sir, the Maruts have escaped.
4719	4721	Go after them, don't let them run away!
4722	4724	Get in the car quick! After them!
4743	4746	Run, split out! Quick!
4767	4770	Hurry up! We must get the evidence out!
4771	4773	Run, quick!
4863	4865	Stone, go that way, quick!!
4872	4873	Quickly, run!
4942	4944	August 8, 1945
4946	4948	Proclaim Bacterial Bomb Experiment
4957	4959	Cover him!
4988	4990	Put him down here.
5022	5024	Sorry to disturb you!
5028	5030	Urgent telegram from Headquarters, sir!
5036	5038	Nagasaki was bombed.
5039	5040	The Russians have officially declared war.
5041	5044	The Kwangtung Army H.Q. ordered all troops to retreat if necessary.
5044	5046	Are you coming back, sir?
5051	5053	All troops to retreat?
5056	5058	What do we do, sir?
5082	5084	Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been bombed by the Americans.
5085	5087	The cities have been completely destroyed.
5087	5089	Now the Russians have declared war to us.
5090	5092	Our fate has been sealed.
5093	5095	We've received orders to retreat.
5096	5098	But l personally think,
5098	5100	that the work of the 731 Sqdn.
5101	5103	involves top security information.
5104	5106	So l'm now requesting the following:
5108	5110	1) Exterminate all remaining Maruts
5111	5113	& destroy this whole facility.
5114	5116	The engineers will be in charge of that the place must be flattened, l want no traces left.
5117	5119	2) Collect all data and documents
5120	5121	destroy them at once.
5122	5124	3) The Youth Corps is to retreat to Tung Hwa,
5125	5128	4) All units will commit suicide.
5129	5132	5) Their families and departments
5133	5136	will also commit suicide.
5137	5140	ln other words...
5141	5146	no evidence must be left behind!
5148	5150	Dr. lshii,
5151	5153	Our squadron has a lot of highly qualified people,
5153	5155	isn't it a waste do order them to die?
5156	5158	We shouldn't allow such meaningless sacrifices.
5159	5161	l realize that too Gen. Kikuchi,
5161	5163	but we have to guard the secret of this place.
5164	5165	Dr. lshii, if...
5166	5170	you commit suicide, then l'll join you.
5172	5175	These soldiers & their families have followed you
5175	5178	from Japan to Manchuria.
5178	5180	You should at least,
5181	5183	get them back home.
5184	5186	lsn't that reasonable?
5186	5188	As the head of 731you're responsible for them.
5189	5191	You should be protecting them, not ordering them to die.
5191	5193	l hope you face up your responsibilities.
5193	5195	Gen. Kikuchi is right
5196	5198	We should return to our home land,
5199	5202	and we should take all data with us.
5209	5211	That might be possible,
5213	5216	but we must still prepare for the possibility of being captured.
5216	5218	No matter what,
5218	5220	we can't allow these secrets to be made known.
5220	5222	How about this?
5222	5224	We issue each one with a bottle of cyanide,
5224	5226	if anyone's captured, then they
5227	5229	commit suicide.
5232	5233	Well...
5233	5235	that's what we'll do.
5235	5237	l will personal be in charge of the retreat,
5238	5239	& arrange the transport.
5240	5242	l'm very happy you made this decision,
5243	5246	l'm sure everybody is grateful to you.
5270	5272	What are you doing?
5274	5276	These are our children's clothes!
5276	5278	The data is important!
5288	5290	Please take this with you, Madame!
5290	5293	You must take it if you are captured.
5294	5296	Mr. Takamura prepared them.
5301	5303	Where are you going at his time?
5303	5305	l'm going to the office to get more data!
5306	5308	The war is over and we are going home!
5309	5311	Shut up! What do you know!
5312	5314	l don't care about anything else
5315	5318	all l know is that we are going home!
5320	5322	You are a woman, you know nothing!
5323	5324	Yes l may know nothing,
5325	5327	and l certainly don't know how to make poison!
5328	5330	How dare you to speak to me like that!
5332	5334	Takamura! Takamura!
5340	5342	This is important data,
5342	5345	We can not destroy it!
5345	5347	lf anyone dares to burn anymore...
5347	5351	Takamura, l just want to go home! Nothing else is important!
5354	5357	That’s all l want, Takamura!
5364	5367	Burn it! Burn it all!
5368	5371	Takamura! This is an order, burn it all!
5372	5374	l don't want a single piece left.
5377	5379	You can't destroy the data!
5379	5381	This is the whole reason for our being here!
5381	5384	lt represents years of hard work!
5387	5389	& Japan will need it one day!
5390	5392	lf you want to destroy it kill me first!
5426	5429	We're releasing the poison gas! Retreat! Hurry up!
5468	5471	Hasegawa, Miki, come quick!
5472	5474	Miki, go up!
5509	5512	lt's platinum, it's worth a lot of money.
5545	5548	This place is blowing up! Find shelter!
5599	5602	Quick, retreat!
5603	5605	Retreat!
5624	5627	Come on, let's go!
5644	5646	This place is blowing up. Find shelter!
5670	5673	August 15, 1945
5713	5715	Where are you going? Get back!
5716	5718	l'm sorry, quick!
5719	5720	Don't run around!
5871	5875	Hold on, Madame, Hold on!
5879	5882	Sir, Mrs. Takamura is going into labor!
5883	5884	Can't she get in the car?
5884	5887	The car is full of Dr. lshii's personal data.
5911	5913	Sir, the train is leaving in 5 minutes.
5914	5917	Do you want a last look at the squadron?
5924	5926	Al right!
5969	5972	Gentlemen! This is just a change in strategy,
5973	5975	The Great Japanese Empire
5976	5979	has still not been defeated,
5980	5982	our base has been destroyed,
5983	5985	but our careers will continue.
5985	5988	Now you’re all going back to Japan,
5989	5992	l trust you will safe guard the secrets of this base
5993	5995	and always remember this
5996	5999	no contact is allowed between squadron members
6000	6004	and under no circumstances will you reveal the nature of work here.
6005	6007	You are disbarred from taking up government posts.
6008	6013	Anyone who contravenes these conditions will be severely punished.
6097	6099	Madame! Madame!
