139	143	They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer.
143	144	What?
144	146	Well, it's eight o'clock and it's still light.
146	149	A lot of good the extra daylight does us.
149	151	Now we've still got a three-hour drive back.
151	153	We're not going to be home until after midnight.
153	156	Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny, you wouldn't do it.
156	159	You think I wanna blow Sunday on a scene like this?
159	161	You know, I figure we're either gonna have to move mother out here,
161	163	or move the grave into Pittsburgh.
163	165	She can't make a trip like this.
166	168	I don't know that she can't.
168	172	- Is there any candy left? - No.
172	175	Look at this thing. "We still remember. "
175	177	I don't. You know, I don't even remember what the man I
177	179	Johnny, it takes you five minutes.
179	184	5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave and 6 hours to drive back and forth.
184	186	Mother wants to remember, so we trot 200 miles into the count
186	188	and she stays at home.
189	190	Well, we're here, John, all right?
198	201	Radio: Testing... back on... Ah, ladies and... We're coming back
201	203	on the air after an interruption due to technical problem...
216	219	There's nothing wrong with the radio. Must've been the station.
219	221	Which row is it in?
241	243	There's no one around.
244	246	Well, it's late. If you'd gotten up earlier...
246	249	Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep in the time change.
249	252	I think you complain just to hear yourself talk.
252	254	There it is.
270	273	I wonder what happened to the one from last year.
273	276	Each year we spend good money on these things.
276	279	We come out here, and the one from last year is gone.
279	281	Well, the flowers die,
281	283	And the caretaker or somebody takes them away.
284	287	Yeah, a little spit and polish,
287	288	he can clean this up sell it next year.
289	292	Wonder how many times we bought the same one?
309	312	Hey, come on, Barb, church was this morning, huh?
331	335	Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh? Come on.
335	338	I haven't seen you in church lately.
340	342	Well, there's not much sense in my going to church.
343	346	Do you remember one time when we were small, we were out here?
347	348	It was from right over there.
349	350	I jumped out at you from behind the tree
351	353	And grandpa got all excited, and he shook his fist at me, and he said,
353	356	"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "
356	358	Remember that? Right over there.
359	360	Well, you used to really be scared here.
362	363	Johnny.
364	367	- Well, you're still afraid. - Stop it now. I mean it.
371	374	They're coming to get you, Barbra.
374	377	Stop it. You're ignorant.
377	379	They're coming for you, Barbra.
380	382	Stop it. You're acting like a child.
383	384	They're coming for you.
385	388	Look! There comes one of them now.
388	391	- He'll hear you. - Here he comes. I getting out of here.
391	393	Johnny!
403	405	Johnny!
405	406	Help me!
835	837	It's all right.
840	842	Don't worry about him. I can handle him.
842	845	Probably be a lot more of them as soon as they find out about us.
848	850	Truck is outta gas.
850	852	This pump out here is locked. Is there a key?
854	857	We can try to get out of here if we can get some gas. Is there a key?
867	869	I suppose you've tried this.
878	880	Do you live here?
903	905	We've gotta get out of here.
905	907	We have to get where there are some other people.
911	913	Maybe we better take some food.
913	917	I'll see if I can find some food.
960	964	- What's happening? - I'll be just a second.
964	965	What's happening?
979	980	Two of them.
986	989	There are two of them out there. Have you seen any more around here?
989	991	I can take care of those two.
991	993	- I know you're afraid, but we have to... - I don't know! I don't know!
993	995	What's happening?
1136	1138	They know we're in here now.
1153	1154	Don't look at it.
1228	1230	Get some more lights on in this house.
1268	1271	Why don't you see if you can find some wood, some boards,
1271	1273	something there by the fireplace, Something we can nail this place up?
1278	1279	Well, goddamn...
1282	1286	Look. I know you're afraid. I'm afraid too.
1286	1290	But we have to try to board the house up together.
1290	1293	Now, I'm going to board up the windows and the doors. Do you understand?
1293	1295	We'll be all right here.
1295	1299	We'll be all right till someone comes to rescue us. But we have to work together.
1299	1300	You'll have to help me.
1300	1303	Now I want you to go in and get some wood so I can board the place up.
1304	1305	Ok?
1306	1307	Ok?
1467	1468	They're not that strong.
1469	1472	Here, I want you to pick out some nails. Pick out the biggest ones you can find.
1477	1480	There, this room looks pretty secure.
1482	1485	If we have to, we can run in here and board up the doors.
1488	1491	Won't be long before those things'll be back, pounding their way in here.
1491	1495	They're afraid now.
1496	1499	They're afraid of fire. I found that out.
1512	1516	You know a place back down the road called Beekman's? Beekman's diner?
1522	1525	Anyhow, that's where I found that truck I have out there.
1527	1529	There's a radio in the truck.
1531	1533	I had jumped in to listen to it,
1533	1537	When a big gasoline truck came screaming right across the road.
1537	1541	Well, there must have been 10-15 of those things chasing after it.
1543	1545	Grabbing and holding on.
1548	1550	Now, I didn't see them at first.
1552	1555	I could just see that the truck was moving in a funny way.
1556	1558	And those things were catching up to it.
1561	1564	Truck went right across the road.
1564	1568	Slammed on my brakes to keep from hitting it myself.
1568	1570	It went right through the guard rail.
1576	1580	I guess... I guess the driver must have cut off the road,
1580	1584	into that gas station by Beekman's diner.
1584	1588	It went right through the billboard. Ripped over a gas pump,
1588	1589	and never stopped moving.
1589	1591	By now it's like a moving bonfire.
1595	1598	Didn't know if the truck was going to explode or what.
1601	1605	I can still hear the man, screaming.
1609	1613	This thing is just backing away from it.
1614	1618	I look back at the diner to see
1618	1620	If there was anyone there who could help me.
1623	1625	That was when I noticed that
1625	1627	The entire place had been encircled.
1629	1632	Wasn't a sign of life left, except...
1636	1638	by now, there were no more screams.
1640	1642	I realized that...
1644	1645	I was alone.
1645	1647	With 50 or 60 of those things.
1648	1651	Just standing there,
1652	1654	staring at me.
1655	1657	I started to drive. I...
1659	1661	Just plowed right through them.
1661	1663	They didn't move.
1663	1669	They didn't run, or... Just stood there, staring at me.
1671	1673	Just wanted to crush them.
1677	1681	They... Scattered through the air, like bugs.
1684	1687	We were riding in the cemetery.
1688	1689	Johnny and me.
1690	1692	Johnny.
1698	1702	We... we came to put a wreath on my father's grave.
1704	1708	Johnny and... and he said,
1709	1712	"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"
1715	1717	And we didn't have any.
1720	1721	And...
1726	1727	Oh, it's hot in here.
1728	1729	Hot...
1736	1739	And he said, "Oh, it's late. "
1739	1741	"Why did we start so late?"
1742	1744	And I said, "Johnny,
1744	1747	"if you'd gotten up earlier,
1747	1749	"we wouldn't be late. "
1750	1753	Johnny asked me if I were afraid.
1753	1756	And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny. "
1758	1762	And then this man started walking up the road.
1764	1768	He came slowly, and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,
1768	1771	"He's coming to get you, Barbra. "
1771	1774	And I laughed at him, and said, "Johnny, stop it. "
1776	1779	And then Johnny ran away.
1779	1781	And I went up to this man,
1781	1783	and I was going to apologize,
1785	1787	Why don't you just keep calm?
1787	1790	And I looked up, and I said, "Good eve... "
1792	1793	And he grabbed me!
1795	1798	He grabbed me! And he ripped at me!
1799	1802	He held me and he ripped at my clothes!
1802	1804	I think you should just calm down.
1805	1809	Oh, I screamed, "Johnny! Johnny, help me! Oh, help me!"
1809	1813	And he wouldn't let me go. He ripped...
1816	1818	And then Johnny came and he ran
1819	1822	And he... he fought this man,
1823	1825	And I got so afraid I ran.
1825	1827	I ran... I ran...
1831	1834	And Johnny didn't come.
1835	1838	We've got... we have to wait for Johnny.
1844	1847	Maybe... we'd better go out and get him.
1848	1850	We have to go out and get Johnny.
1850	1852	He's out there.
1853	1857	Please, don't you hear me? We've got to go out and get him.
1859	1862	Please! We have got to go get Johnny!
1863	1865	Please help me!
1867	1870	Look, don't you know what's going on out there? This is no Sunday school picnic.
1870	1872	Don't you understand? My brother is alone.
1872	1876	- Your brother is dead. - No! My brother is not dead!
1931	1933	Radio: Because of the obvious threat to untold numbers of citizens,
1933	1936	and because of the crisis which is even now developing,
1936	1939	this radio station will remain on the air, day and night.
1940	1942	This station and hundreds of other radio and TV stations
1942	1944	throughout this part of the country are pooling their resources
1944	1949	Through an emergency network hookup to keep you informed of all developments.
1949	1953	At this hour, we repeat, these are the facts as we know them.
1953	1955	There is an epidemic of mass murder
1955	1958	being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins.
1958	1960	The murders are taking place in villages, cities,
1960	1965	Rural homes and suburbs with no apparent pattern or reason for the slayings.
1965	1969	It seems to be a sudden, general explosion of mass homicide.
1969	1971	We have some descriptions of the assassins.
1971	1974	Eyewitnesses say they are ordinary looking people.
1974	1977	Some say they appear to be in a kind of trance.
1977	1979	Others describe them as being...
1989	1995	So, at this point there is no really authentic way for us
1996	1997	to say who or what to look for and guard yourself against.
1997	2001	...reaction of law enforcement officials
2001	2005	is one of complete bewilderment at this hour.
2007	2011	Police, sheriffs' deputies, and emergency ambulances
2011	2013	are literally deluged with calls for help
2013	2015	The scene can best be described as mayhem.
2015	2018	Mayors of Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Miami,
2018	2021	Along with the governors of several eastern and midwestern states
2021	2024	have indicated the national guard may be mobilized at any moment,
2024	2025	but that has not happened as yet.
2025	2030	The only advice our reporters have been able to get from official sources
2030	2034	is for private citizens to stay in their homes behind locked doors.
2034	2036	Do not venture outside, for any reason,
2036	2038	until the nature of this crisis has been determined
2038	2042	and until we can advise what course of action to take.
2042	2044	Keep listening to radio and TV
2044	2048	for any special instructions as this crisis develops further.
2048	2051	Thousands of office and factory workers are being urged
2051	2053	to stay at their places of employment,
2053	2055	not to make any attempt to get to their homes.
2055	2058	However, in spite of this urging and warning,
2058	2061	streets and highways are packed with frantic people
2061	2064	trying to reach their families, or apparently to flee just anywhere.
2065	2070	Repeat: The safest course of action at this time is simply to stay where you...
2089	2091	Ladies and gentlemen, we've just received word
2091	2093	that the president has called a meeting of his cabinet
2093	2095	to deal with the sudden epidemic of murder
2095	2098	which has seized the eastern third of this nation.
2098	2101	The meeting is scheduled to convene within the hour.
2101	2103	Members of the presidential cabinet will be joined
2103	2107	by officials of the FBI and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.
2108	2110	A White House spokesman, in announcing this conference,
2110	2112	says there will be an official announcement
2112	2114	as soon as possible following that meeting.
2114	2116	This is the latest dispatch just received in our newsroom.
2117	2121	Latest word also from national press services in Washington, D.C.,
2121	2126	that the emergency presidential conference which we've just mentioned
2126	2130	Will include high-ranking scientists from NASA.
2141	2143	Radio and TV stations across the eastern part of the country
2144	2145	including the one to which you are listening
2146	2149	have joined their facilities in an emergency network
2149	2151	to bring you this news as it develops.
2151	2153	We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV
2153	2155	and to stay indoors at all costs.
2157	2159	Late reports reaching this newsroom
2159	2161	tell of frightened people seeking refuge
2161	2163	in churches, schools and government buildings.
2163	2165	Demanding shelter and protection
2165	2167	from the wholesale murder which apparently
2167	2168	is engulfing much of the nation.
2169	2172	Law enforcement officials are at a loss to explain or,
2172	2174	even at this hour, even to theorize
2174	2176	about the reasons for this wave of murder...
2178	2183	Chief T.K. Dunmore of Camden, North Carolina, is quoted as saying, quote,
2183	2188	"Tell the people, for God's sake, to get off the streets. "
2188	2191	"Tell 'em to go home and lock their doors and windows up tight. "
2191	2195	"We don't know what kind of murder-happy characters we have here. " End quote.
2196	2199	That's chief Dunmore of Camden, North Carolina.
2199	2202	So far the only descriptions, the only clues,
2202	2206	anyone has of the killers come from frightened witnesses.
2207	2209	These eyewitness accounts variously describe
2209	2211	the murderers as "ordinary looking people,"
2211	2212	"Misshapen monsters. "
2213	2215	"People who look like they're in a trance. "
2215	2218	And "things that look like people but act like animals. "
2218	2221	Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims
2221	2224	who look as though they had been torn apart.
2224	2228	This whole ghastly story began developing two days ago
2228	2232	with the report of the slaying of a family of seven...
2232	2234	Since then, reports of some senseless killings
2234	2236	began snowballing in a reign of terror
2236	2237	which has hopscotched...
2242	2244	...keep track of the murder reports
2244	2246	by the placing of markers on a map
2246	2248	seem to indicate a general spreading
2248	2251	from the extreme southeastern and states north and west.
2252	2253	Our newsmen, who have been on the telephone
2253	2255	talking with officials of other cities
2255	2258	have determined that none of this kind of mass murder
2259	2262	has yet been reported west of the Mississippi river,
2262	2265	except in the extreme southeastern portion of Texas.
2265	2267	Similar killings have been reported
2267	2269	around the Houston and Galveston areas
2269	2270	but nothing like the...
2270	2271	I found a gun and some bullets out there.
2274	2275	Oh, and these.
2284	2286	This place is boarded up pretty solid now.
2287	2289	We ought to be all right here for a while.
2290	2292	We have a gun and bullets,
2293	2294	Food and the radio,
2297	2300	Sooner or later, someone's bound to come and get us out.
2302	2305	So again, we join with law enforcement agencies
2305	2307	in urging you to seek shelter in a building.
2307	2309	Lock the doors and windows securely.
2309	2310	Hey, that's us. We're doing all right.
2311	2312	Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,
2313	2315	and keep tuned to your radio and television
2315	2316	for survival instructions
2316	2318	and further details of this continuing story.
2318	2320	Look, I don't know if you're hearing me.
2321	2323	But I'm going upstairs now.
2325	2327	If anything should try to break in, I can hear it from up there.
2327	2329	I'll be down to take care of it.
2331	2333	Everything is all right for now.
2333	2336	I'll be back to reinforce the windows and doors later.
2337	2339	But you'll be all right for now, ok?
2341	2342	Ok?
2345	2348	Radio: Civil defense officials in Cumberland
2348	2349	have told newsmen that murder victims
2349	2354	show evidence of having been partially devour by their murderers.
2393	2396	Consistent reports from witnesses to the effect that people
2396	2399	who acted as though they were in a kind of trance
2399	2400	were killing and eating their victims.
2400	2404	Prompted authorities to examine the bodies of some of the victims.
2404	2408	Medical authorities in Cumberland have concluded that in all cases
2408	2412	the killers are eating the flesh of the people they murdered.
2412	2416	Repeating this latest bulletin just received moments ago from Cumberland.
2416	2418	Civil defense authorities have told newsmen
2418	2420	that murder victims show evidence
2421	2423	of having been partially devoured by their murderers.
2423	2427	Medical examination of victims' bodies shows conclusively that
2427	2430	the killers are eating the flesh of the people they kill.
2431	2436	And so this incredible story becomes more ghastly with each report.
2436	2438	It's difficult to imagine such a thing actually happening
2438	2442	but these are the reports we have been receiving and passing on to you,
2442	2445	Reports which have been verified as completely as is possible
2445	2447	in this confused situation.
2460	2463	- Hold it! - Don't shoot. We're from town.
2463	2464	A radio!
2465	2468	Radio: The Butler county sheriff has verified that reports
2468	2472	of murder victims being partially eaten by their slayers is true.
2474	2477	How long you guys been down there? I could've used some help up here.
2477	2479	That's the cellar. It's the safest place.
2479	2481	You mean you didn't hear the racket we were making up here?
2481	2483	How were we supposed to know what was going on?
2483	2485	Could've been those things for all we knew.
2485	2486	That girl was screaming.
2486	2488	Surely you must know what a girl screaming sounds like.
2488	2489	Those things don't make any noise.
2490	2492	Anybody would know somebody needed help.
2492	2495	Look, it's kind of hard to hear what's going on from down there.
2495	2497	We thought we could hear screams, but for all we knew,
2497	2500	that could have meant those things were in the house after her.
2500	2503	- And you wouldn't come up and help? - Well, if there were more...
2503	2505	The racket sounded like the place was being ripped apart.
2505	2507	How were we supposed to know what was going on?
2507	2509	Now wait a minute.
2509	2511	You just got finished saying you couldn't hear it from down there.
2511	2514	Now you say it sounded like the place was being ripped apart.
2514	2516	It would be nice if you'd get your story straight, man.
2516	2518	All right, now you tell me.
2519	2522	I'm not going to take that kind of a chance when we've got a safe place.
2522	2525	We luck into a safe place, and you're telling us
2525	2528	we've gotta risk our lives just because somebody might need help, huh?
2528	2531	- Yeah. Something like that. - All right, why don't we settle this...
2531	2532	Look, mister!
2532	2534	We came up, ok? We're here.
2535	2537	Now I suggest we all go back downstairs
2537	2539	before any of those things find out we're in here.
2539	2540	They can't get in here.
2541	2542	You got the whole place boarded up?
2542	2543	Yeah, most of it.
2543	2546	All but a few spots upstairs. They won't be hard to fix.
2546	2549	You are insane. The cellar's the safest place.
2549	2551	I'm telling you, they can't get in here.
2551	2554	And I'm telling you, those things turned over our car.
2554	2556	We were damned lucky to get away at all.
2556	2560	Now you tell me those... things can't get through this lousy pile of wood?
2560	2564	His wife and kid's downstairs. The kid's hurt.
2566	2568	Well, I still think we're better off up here.
2569	2571	We could strengthen everything up, Mr. Cooper.
2572	2574	With all of us working, we could fix this place up in no time.
2574	2576	We have everything we need up here.
2576	2579	We can take all that stuff downstairs with us.
2579	2580	Man, you're really crazy, you know that?
2580	2582	You got a million windows up here.
2582	2583	All these windows. You're gonna...
2583	2586	You're gonna make 'em strong enough to keep these things out, huh?
2586	2587	I told you, those things don't have any strength.
2587	2590	I smashed three of them and pushed another one out the door.
2590	2594	Did you hear me, what I told you? They turned over our car.
2594	2596	Oh hell, any good five men can do that.
2596	2597	That's my point...
2597	2599	Only there's not going to be five, or even ten.
2599	2602	There's gonna be twenty, thirty, maybe a hundred of those things.
2602	2603	And as soon as they know we're here,
2603	2605	this place is gonna be crawling with them.
2605	2608	Well, if there're that many, they'll probably get us wherever we are.
2609	2611	Look, the cellar.
2611	2613	The cellar. There's only one door, right?
2613	2616	Just one door. That's all we have to protect.
2616	2619	Tom and I fixed it so it locks and boards from the inside.
2619	2620	But up here, all these windows,
2621	2623	Why, we'd never know where they were gonna hit us next.
2623	2624	You got a point, Mr. Cooper.
2624	2627	But down in the cellar, there's no place to run to.
2628	2631	I mean, if they did get in, there'd be no back exit. We'd be done for.
2632	2634	We can get out of here if we have to.
2634	2637	And we got windows to see what's going on outside.
2637	2639	But down there, with no windows,
2639	2642	if a rescue party did come, we wouldn't even know it.
2642	2644	But the cellar is the strongest place.
2644	2646	The cellar is a death trap.
2646	2649	I don't know, Mr. Cooper. I think he's right.
2650	2652	You know how many's out there?
2652	2653	I don't know, I figure maybe six or seven.
2654	2657	Look. You two can do whatever you like.
2657	2661	I'm going back down to the cellar and you better decide,
2661	2663	'cause I'm gonna board up that door,
2663	2665	and I'm not gonna unlock it again no matter what happens.
2665	2667	Now wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
2667	2670	No, I'm not gonna wait! I've made my decision, now you make yours.
2670	2673	Now wait a minute! Let's think about this.
2673	2675	We can make it to the cellar if we have to.
2675	2679	And if we do decide to stay down there, We'll need some things from up here.
2679	2681	So let's at least consider this a while.
2686	2687	If you box yourself in the cellar
2687	2689	and those things get in the house, you've had it.
2689	2692	At least up here, you have a fighting chance.
2695	2698	Yeah, looks like about eight or ten of them now.
2698	2702	That's more than there were. There're a lot out back, too.
2744	2747	Harry? Harry, what's happening?
2747	2749	It's all right!
2763	2765	Now take it.
2804	2806	We've gotta fix these boards.
2807	2808	You're crazy!
2808	2811	Those things are gonna be at every window and door in this place!
2811	2812	We've got to get down into the cellar.
2812	2815	Go down into your damn cellar and get out of here!
2817	2820	- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me. - You leave her here.
2820	2822	Keep your hands off her, and everything else that's up here too.
2823	2825	Because if I stay up here, I'm fighting for everything up here,
2825	2828	and the radio and the food is part of what I'm fighting for.
2828	2830	Now if you're going down in the cellar, get.
2830	2831	The man's insane. He's insane.
2833	2836	We've... we've got to have food down there. We've got a right.
2836	2838	- This your house? - We've got a right.
2838	2840	You going down there with him?
2840	2844	Yes or no? This is your last chance. No beating around the bush.
2845	2846	Listen, I got a kid down there.
2847	2849	She can't possib... I couldn't bring her up here.
2849	2851	She can't possibly take all the racket from those things
2851	2853	smashing through the windows.
2853	2854	Well, you're her father.
2854	2857	If you're stupid enough to go die in that trap, that's your business.
2857	2860	However, I am not stupid enough to follow you.
2861	2863	It is tough for the kid that her old man is so stupid.
2863	2866	Now, get the hell down in the cellar.
2866	2869	You can be the boss down there. I'm boss up here.
2871	2873	You bastards!
2875	2878	You know, I won't open this door again. I mean it.
2878	2881	- Mr. Cooper, with your help... - With my help.
2881	2884	Let him go, man. His mind is made up.
2886	2887	Wait a minute.
2890	2891	Judy? Come on up here, honey.
2899	2900	You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
2901	2902	It's all right, honey. Go ahead.
2913	2916	If we stick together, man, we can fix it up real good.
2916	2919	There's lots of places we can run to up here.
2920	2922	Mr. Cooper? We'd all be a lot better off
2923	2925	if all three of us were working together.
2928	2930	Hey. Hey, kid.
2938	2940	He's wrong, you know.
2941	2942	I'm not boxing myself in down there.
2950	2952	Well, we're safe now. It's boarded up tight.
2954	2955	What about Tom and Judy?
2956	2957	They wanna stay up there. Let 'em.
2962	2967	There are... two other people upstairs. A man and a girl.
2967	2968	We heard the screaming.
2969	2971	Yeah, but I didn't know who they were,
2971	2973	and I wasn't about to take any unnecessary chances.
2973	2975	Of course not, Harry.
2988	2993	- Is she all right? - I don't know what it is.
2993	2994	She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.
2995	2996	Where'd you get the bandage?
2997	3000	Some laundry in the basket. I tore a sheet.
3008	3010	Let them stay upstairs.
3011	3012	Let them.
3013	3016	Too many ways those monsters can get in up there.
3017	3019	We'll see who's right.
3019	3023	We'll see, when they come begging me to let them in down here.
3023	3025	- That's important, isn't it? - What?
3026	3028	To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
3028	3029	What do you mean by that?
3033	3036	Does anyone up there know why we're being attacked?
3037	3040	Whatever it is, it isn't just happening here.
3040	3042	It's some kind of mass murder. It's going on everywhere.
3043	3045	- The radio said to stay inside... - Radio?
3046	3048	Radio, upstairs. I heard the news bulletin.
3048	3051	There's a radio upstairs and you boarded us in down here?
3051	3053	- I know what I'm doing. - What did it say?
3053	3055	Nothing! Nothing. They don't know anything yet.
3056	3057	The... there's mass murder everywhere, and
3057	3061	people are supposed to look for a safe place to hide.
3061	3063	Take the boards off that door.
3063	3065	We are staying down here, Helen.
3065	3068	Harry, that radio is at least some kind of communication.
3068	3070	If the authorities know what's happening,
3070	3073	Well, they'll send people for us, or they'll tell us what to do.
3074	3075	How are we going to know what's going on,
3075	3077	if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?
3088	3090	We may not enjoy living together...
3091	3094	But dying together isn't going to solve anything.
3095	3097	Those people aren't our enemies.
3097	3098	Mr. Cooper!
3100	3103	Mr. Cooper? They found a television set upstairs.
3106	3107	Let's go up.
3107	3108	Tom?
3109	3109	Yes?
3110	3113	If Judy would come downstairs for a few minutes,
3113	3115	Harry and I could come upstairs.
3116	3118	Ok. Yeah. Right away.
3121	3122	Will you do it?
3122	3124	Do I have to?
3124	3128	Look, honey. Nothing's gonna get done with them down there and us up here.
3128	3132	- Do this. For me. - Ok.
3133	3135	Ok, open up.
3157	3158	I'll take good care of her, Helen.
3162	3163	She's all I have.
3165	3167	Why don't you go upstairs now?
3195	3196	Her brother was killed.
3197	3199	Hey... give me a hand with this thing.
3200	3202	I gotta go help Ben with the television.
3246	3247	Don't be afraid of me.
3248	3251	I'm Helen Cooper. Harry's wife.
3259	3263	This place is ridiculous. Look at this.
3263	3265	There's a million weak spots up here.
3267	3268	Give me one of those.
3273	3274	Her brother was killed.
3282	3284	And they talk about these windows.
3285	3287	I can't see a damned thing.
3287	3289	There could be 15 million of those things out there.
3290	3291	That's how much good these windows are.
3296	3298	Why don't you do something to help somebody?
3304	3306	Here, I have it. Drag a couple of those chairs together.
3306	3308	There's a socket over here.
3313	3316	Now, you'd better watch this and try to understand what's going on.
3318	3320	I don't want anyone's life on my hands.
3320	3321	Is there anything I can do to help?
3321	3323	I don't want to hear any more from you, mister.
3323	3325	If you stay up here, you take orders from me!
3325	3327	And that includes leaving the girl alone.
3328	3329	It's on! It's on!
3329	3330	There's no sound.
3331	3333	Play with the rabbit ears.
3333	3336	Reports, incredible as they seem,
3336	3339	are not the results of mass hysteria.
3339	3342	"Mass hysteria. " What do they think, we're imagining all this?
3342	3343	Shut up.
3343	3344	In all parts of the country.
3344	3348	The wave of murder which is sweeping the eastern third of the nation
3348	3350	is being committed by creatures
3350	3353	who feast upon the flesh of their victims.
3353	3356	First eyewitness accounts of this grisly development
3356	3360	came from people who were understandably frightened and almost incoherent.
3361	3364	Officials and newsmen at first discounted
3364	3367	those eyewitness descriptions as being beyond belief.
3367	3370	However, the reports persisted.
3370	3372	Medical examinations of some of the victims
3372	3376	bore out the fact that they had been partially devoured.
3378	3380	I think we have some late word just arriving
3381	3383	and we interrupt to bring this to you.
3385	3387	This is the latest disclosure in a report
3387	3389	from National civil defense headquarters in Washington.
3390	3394	It has been established that persons who have recently died
3394	3398	have been returning to life and committing acts of murder.
3398	3403	A widespread investigation of reports from funeral homes, morgues & hospitals
3403	3407	has concluded that the unburied dead are coming back to life
3407	3409	and seeking human victims.
3410	3413	It's hard for us here to believe what we're reporting to you,
3413	3415	but it does seem to be a fact.
3416	3418	When this emergency first began,
3418	3422	radio and television was advising people to stay inside,
3422	3424	behind locked doors, for safety.
3424	3426	Well, that situation has now changed.
3426	3429	We're able to report a definite course of action for you.
3429	3432	Civil defense machinery has been organized to provide
3432	3435	rescue stations with food, shelter,
3435	3439	medical treatment and protection by armed National Guardsmen.
3439	3442	Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations in your local area
3442	3444	for this list of rescue stations.
3444	3447	This list will be repeated throughout our news coverage.
3448	3451	Look for the name of the rescue station nearest you,
3451	3454	and make your way to that location as soon as possible.
3455	3457	So we have that truck. If we can get some gas, we can get outta here.
3458	3460	- There's a pump out by the shed. - I know. That's why I pulled in here.
3460	3461	But it's locked.
3461	3464	...called this afternoon by the president.
3464	3467	Since convening, this conference of the presidential cabinet,
3467	3470	The FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA
3470	3473	has not produced any public information.
3473	3476	Why are space experts being consulted
3476	3478	about an earthbound emergency?
3479	3482	So far, all the betting on the answer to that question
3482	3485	centers on the recent explorer satellite shot to Venus.
3486	3489	That satellite, you recall, started back to Earth,
3489	3490	but never got here.
3491	3493	That's the space vehicle which orbited Venus
3493	3496	and then was purposely destroyed by NASA,
3496	3498	when scientists discovered it was carrying
3498	3500	a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.
3501	3503	Could that radiation be somehow responsible
3503	3506	for the wholesale murders we're now suffering?
3506	3509	Newsman Don Quinn in Washington
3509	3510	has posed those questions.
3510	3512	It's obvious. Our best move is to try to get out of here.
3512	3514	How're you gonna get over to that pump?
3514	3515	Look!
3516	3519	You're coming from a meeting regarding the explosion of the Venus probe,
3519	3520	is that right?
3520	3523	Yes, yes, that was the subject of the meeting.
3523	3525	Do you feel there is a connection between this and the phenomenon...
3525	3528	There's a definite connection. A definite connection.
3528	3530	In other words, you feel that the radiation on the Venus probe is enough
3531	3532	to cause these mutations?
3532	3533	It was a very high degree of radiation.
3534	3536	Well, just a minute. I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
3536	3539	I don't think that has been... It's the only logical explanation
3539	3540	that we have at this time.
3540	3542	In other words, it is the military's viewpoint that this...
3542	3545	the radiation is not the cause of the mutation.
3545	3548	I can't speak for the entire military at this time, gentlemen.
3548	3551	I must disagree with these gentlemen presently,
3551	3554	until we, until this is irrefutably proved.
3554	3556	Everything is being done that can be done.
3556	3558	We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.
3559	3562	Professor, you feel that there is a definite connection between...
3562	3565	A definite connection as far as Dr. Keller and myself...
3565	3568	Doctor, please. I thought we decided that is not proved yet.
3569	3570	Was it... was the satellite...
3570	3573	- When the satellite was exploded... - It was an unusual amount of radiation,
3573	3576	enough to cause mutation under certain circumstances.
3576	3578	Could have happened to have a bearing on it.
3579	3580	It does seem to have a bearing on it.
3581	3583	Will there be a reply for the...
3584	3585	- There will be a reply? - Yes.
3585	3586	Later this afternoon?
3589	3591	There will be a report this afternoon.
3591	3594	Perhaps there will be a report later...
3594	3595	Will you close the window?
3595	3597	We are doing everything possible to solve the problem.
3604	3606	We've heard all we need to know. We have to try to get out of here.
3606	3610	He said the rescue stations have doctors and medical supplies.
3610	3612	If we can get Karen there, we can get help for her.
3616	3618	Willard. I saw a sign. That said Willard.
3618	3620	It's only about 17 miles from here.
3620	3623	You know this area. Are you from around here?
3623	3624	Judy and I are both from around here.
3624	3627	We were on our way to the lake to go swimming.
3627	3630	Judy had a radio, and we heard the first reports about this.
3630	3632	So we knew the old house was here and we came in,
3632	3634	And found the lady upstairs, dead.
3635	3638	Then these other people came. We went down into the basement
3638	3640	and put a bar across the door, and it is pretty strong.
3640	3643	How could we possibly get away from here?
3643	3646	We've got a sick child, two women, one woman out of her head,
3646	3650	three men, and the place is surrounded with these things.
3650	3654	For NASA. Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,
3654	3657	has been working very hard to find some solution
3658	3660	to these things that are happening.
3660	3662	Do you have any answers at this time?
3662	3666	Yes, we have some answers. But first let me stress the importance
3666	3669	of seeking medical attention for anyone who's been injured in any way.
3670	3673	We don't know yet what complications might result from such injuries.
3674	3675	How bad has your kid been hurt?
3680	3683	Look. You go down there and tell... Judy?
3684	3687	Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here and you stay with the kid, all right?
3687	3690	Destructive action taken with regard to the Venus probe.
3691	3694	In the cold room at the university, we had a cadaver.
3695	3699	A cadaver from which all four limbs had been amputated.
3699	3701	Sometime early this morning,
3701	3704	it opened its eyes and began to move its trunk.
3704	3708	It was dead, but it opened its eyes and tried to move.
3710	3712	They want you upstairs.
3712	3715	- Did she ask for me? - She hasn't said anything.
3716	3717	I don't understand.
3719	3722	Baby? It's mommy.
3723	3724	I hurt.
3726	3728	I'll come back down as soon as I find out what they want.
3729	3730	Thank you, Judy.
3732	3735	The bodies should be disposed of at once, preferably by cremation.
3736	3739	Well, how long after death, then, does the body become reactivated?
3739	3741	- It's only a matter of minutes. - Minutes?
3742	3743	That doesn't give people time to make arrangements...
3743	3747	No, you're right. It doesn't give them time to make funeral arrangements.
3747	3752	The bodies must be carried to the street and burned.
3752	3756	They must be burned immediately. Soak them with gasoline and burn them.
3756	3760	The bereaved will have to forgo the dubious comforts
3760	3762	that a funeral service will give.
3762	3765	They're just dead flesh. And dangerous.
3766	3768	Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads or sheets
3768	3770	to tear up into small strips, ok?
3770	3773	- Is there a fruit cellar here? - Yes.
3773	3774	We need some bottles or jars
3774	3777	to make Molotov cocktails to hold them off while we try to escape.
3777	3779	Hey! There's a big can of kerosene down there.
3779	3782	- I'll see what I can find. - I'll look for the bottles.
3782	3783	There's a big key ring down there.
3784	3786	There may be a key to the gas pump on it.
3786	3788	I'll check.
3788	3790	We can toss the cocktails from a window upstairs.
3790	3793	Meantime, some of us can go out and try to get the gas,
3793	3795	then we can come back for the rest of the people.
3795	3797	But that'll leave a door open someplace.
3797	3799	Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.
3799	3801	It's closer to the truck.
3802	3805	Before we go out, we'll put some supplies behind the cellar door.
3805	3807	While we're gone, the rest of you can hole up in there.
3807	3809	I found some fruit jars in the cellar.
3809	3812	And there's a key on here that's labeled for the gas pump out back.
3813	3816	I'm not really that used to the truck. I found it abandoned.
3817	3819	I can handle the truck, no sweat.
3822	3825	You're it, then. You and I'll go.
3830	3833	We'll put whatever lumber we find behind the cellar door.
3834	3837	You can go upstairs and toss the cocktails from a window.
3837	3839	Tom, you and I will have to unboard this door.
3839	3841	After you toss the cocktails,
3841	3843	you hustle back down here and lock this door.
3843	3846	It's no good to board it up because we'll have to get back in quickly.
3847	3850	After we get the gas and get back into the house,
3850	3853	then we'll worry about getting everybody into the truck.
3854	3855	Now, let's move it.
3855	3859	No place to flee for safety, except for the rescue stations
3859	3860	which have been set up.
3860	3864	Indications are that before this emergency is over,
3864	3867	we will need many, many more such rescue stations.
3876	3878	You always have a smile for me.
3879	3882	How can you smile like that all the time?
3883	3885	How many do you have done?
3889	3890	Come on, honey, we gotta move.
3891	3892	Tom, are you sure about the phone?
3893	3897	The phone is dead out. All you get is a recorded message.
3897	3901	If I could only call the folks. They're going to be so worried about us.
3902	3903	Everything'll be all right.
3903	3907	As soon as we get to Willard, we'll call them. They might even be there.
3908	3909	I know.
3913	3918	Tom... Are you sure we're doing the right thing, Tom?
3919	3921	- What, about getting outta here? - Yeah.
3922	3924	Well, the television said that's the right thing to do.
3924	3926	We've got to get to a rescue station.
3926	3928	I don't know.
3928	3930	Come on. You're starting to sound like Mr. Cooper now.
3930	3932	But why do you have to go out there?
3932	3936	Look, I know how to handle that truck. And I can handle the pump.
3936	3938	Ben doesn't know anything about that stuff.
3940	3941	But we're safe in here.
3941	3944	For how long, honey? We're safe now.
3944	3946	But there's gonna be more and more of those things.
3947	3948	I know. I know all that.
3953	3957	Listen. Remember when we had the big flood?
3957	3962	Remember how difficult it was for us to convince you that it was right to leave?
3962	3965	Remember? Remember we had to go to Willard then?
3965	3967	This isn't a passing thing, honey.
3968	3971	It... it's not like just a wind passing through.
3971	3974	We've got to do something, and fast.
3980	3982	I just don't want you to go out there, that's all.
3984	3985	Hey... smile, honey.
3986	3988	Where's that big smile for me?
3993	3995	You sure are no use at all, are you?
3995	4000	We've got work to do, honey. And you... you...
4017	4018	We better get her downstairs.
4019	4021	We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.
4023	4025	She's right. You have to go downstairs now.
4025	4027	Just for a little while, until we get back.
4028	4033	- Then we can all leave. - Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.
4052	4054	- Good luck. - Yeah.
4104	4106	- You ready upstairs? - Yeah.
4106	4107	Ok, toss 'em!
4148	4149	Go ahead! Go on!
4165	4166	I'm going with him!
4167	4170	Get back in the cellar! It's too late. Too late!
4178	4180	Well, is she coming? Come on.
4182	4183	Get in!
4256	4257	- Come on! - This key won't work.
4257	4259	Watch it.
4264	4267	Watch the torch!
4273	4275	We've gotta get away from the pump!
4287	4288	Hang on!
4289	4291	Stop! I'm telling you guys to get outta the truck!
4310	4312	Let's get outta here!
4314	4315	Come on, come on!
4315	4316	My jacket's caught.
4385	4386	Let me in!
4387	4388	Cooper!
4453	4455	I ought to drag you out there and feed you to those things.
4546	4548	Isn't it three o'clock yet?
4553	4556	There's supposed to be another broadcast at three o'clock.
4556	4557	Ten minutes.
4560	4562	Oh. Only ten more minutes?
4562	4564	We don't have very long to wait.
4565	4566	We can leave.
4568	4570	Or we better leave soon.
4571	4572	It's ten minutes to three.
4578	4580	You know anything about this area at all?
4581	4582	I mean, is Willard the nearest town?
4584	4586	I don't know.
4589	4590	We were...
4592	4596	Just trying to get to a motel before dark.
4597	4599	You said those things turned your car over.
4599	4601	You think we can get it back on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?
4601	4604	Seems like it was pretty far away.
4605	4606	Seems like we ran.
4607	4609	Forget it. It's at least a mile.
4609	4611	Johnny has the keys.
4612	4614	You're going to carry that child a mile?
4614	4616	Through that army of things out there?
4616	4617	I can carry the kid.
4618	4619	What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?
4621	4624	- One of those things grabbed her. - Bit her on the arm.
4626	4627	What's wrong?
4627	4630	Who knows what kind of disease those things carry?
4631	4633	- Is she conscious? - Barely.
4634	4636	She can't walk. She's too weak.
4639	4641	Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
4641	4643	You gonna turn it over by yourself?
4643	4647	You can't start the car. Johnny has the keys.
4650	4653	You have a car? Where? Where is it?
4653	4657	- You won't be able to start it. - Yeah. I know. But where is it?
4670	4671	Good lord.
4687	4691	At this hour, they report the level of the mysterious radiation
4691	4693	continues to increase steadily.
4693	4695	So long as this situation remains,
4695	4698	government spokesmen warn that dead bodies
4698	4702	will continue to be transformed into the flesh-eating ghouls.
4702	4706	All persons who die during this crisis, from whatever cause,
4706	4709	will come back to life to seek human victims.
4709	4712	Unless their bodies are first disposed of by cremation.
4713	4715	Our News cameras have just returned
4715	4718	from covering such a search and destroy operation against the ghouls.
4718	4721	This one conducted by sheriff Conan McClellan
4721	4723	in Butler County, Pennsylvania.
4723	4725	So now let's go to that film report.
4725	4728	All law enforcement agencies and the military
4729	4732	have been organized to search out and destroy the marauding ghouls.
4732	4735	The survival command center at the Pentagon
4735	4738	has disclosed that a ghoul can be killed
4738	4742	by a shot in the head or a heavy blow to the skull.
4743	4745	Officials are quoted as explaining
4745	4748	that since the brain of a ghoul has been activated by the radiation,
4749	4753	the plan is, kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.
4754	4757	- Want anything from the supply wagon? - No, we're all right.
4759	4761	Hey, Cass, put that thing all the way in the fire.
4761	4764	- We don't want it getting up again. - All right, I gotcha.
4764	4766	Chief McClellan, how's everything going?
4766	4769	Oh, things aren't going too bad. Men are taking it pretty good.
4769	4772	You want to get on the other side of the road over there.
4772	4774	Chief, do you think we'll be able to defeat these things?
4775	4777	Well, we killed 19 of them today, right in this area.
4777	4781	Those last three we caught trying to claw their way into an abandoned shed.
4781	4783	They must have thought somebody was in there. There wasn't, though.
4783	4785	We heard 'em making all kind of noise.
4785	4788	We came over and beat 'em off, blasted 'em down.
4788	4790	Chief, as soon as you're finished, can I see you here?
4790	4791	Yeah, ok.
4791	4794	Chief, if I were surrounded by six or eight of these things,
4794	4795	would I stand a chance with them?
4795	4798	Well, there's no problem. If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.
4798	4799	That's a sure way to kill 'em.
4799	4801	If you don't, get yourself a club or a torch.
4801	4803	Beat 'em or burn 'em. They go up pretty easy.
4804	4806	Well, chief McClellan, how long do you think it'll take
4806	4808	until you get the situation under control?
4808	4811	Well, that's pretty hard to say. We don't know how many of 'em there are.
4811	4813	We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.
4815	4816	Are they slow-moving, chief?
4816	4819	Yeah, they're dead. They're all messed up.
4819	4823	Well, in time, would you say you'd be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?
4824	4826	Well, we don't really know.
4826	4830	We know we'll be into it most of the night, probably into the early morning.
4830	4832	We're working our way toward Willard
4832	4834	and we'll team up with the National Guard over there,
4834	4836	and then we'll be able to give a more definite view.
4836	4838	Thank you very much, chief McClellan.
4838	4841	This is Bill Cardille, WIC-TV 11 news.
4842	4843	Thank you, Bill, for that report.
4844	4846	Official spokesmen declined to speculate
4846	4849	just how long it may take to kill off all the flesh-eaters
4849	4851	so long as the heavy ra...
4857	4859	Is the fuse box in the cellar?
4860	4861	I don't know. I...
4865	4866	Is... isn't the fuse...
4868	4869	The power lines are down.
4871	4875	Helen? I have to get that gun.
4876	4878	Haven't you had enough?
4879	4882	Two people are dead already, on account of that guy.
4882	4884	Take a look out that window. Look at...
4943	4944	Get over here, man!
4946	4946	Come on!
4965	4969	Go ahead. Go ahead. You wanna stay up here now?
4969	4971	Helen, get in the cellar.
4973	4975	Get in the cellar now! Move!
5080	5081	Karen?
5090	5091	Oh, baby.
5094	5095	Baby.
5157	5160	No... no... No! Johnny!
5165	5167	Somebody help me.
5440	5441	Hey, Vince, Bill,
5442	5444	you wanna get about four or five men and a couple dogs?
5444	5447	There's a house over here behind those trees. We wanna go check it out.
5448	5449	You still here, Bill?
5449	5451	Yeah, chief, we're going to stay with it
5451	5452	till we meet up with the National Guard.
5452	5454	- Where'd you get the coffee? - One of the volunteers.
5454	5456	- You're doing all the work, take it. Thank you.
5456	5459	We should be wrapped up here. About three or four more hours,
5459	5460	we'll probably get into Willard's end.
5460	5462	I guess you can go over there and meet the national guard.
5462	5465	Nick, you and the rest of these men wanna come with me?
5466	5467	Bill, I'm checking the office to see what's happening.
5468	5470	All right, Steve, tell 'em we're going to stay with it
5470	5473	and everything appears to be under control.
5523	5525	They need you down there by the barn.
5529	5531	You guys can follow the wagon down.
5531	5534	I only need a few men to check out the house.
5537	5540	- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince. - Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.
5579	5581	He's a dead one. Get up here!
5582	5584	Nick! Tony! Steve!
5585	5587	You wanna get out in that field and build me a bonfire?
5600	5603	You. Drag that out of here and throw it on the fire.
5603	5604	Nothing down here.
5604	5605	All right. Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
5606	5607	Let's go check out the house.
5607	5609	There's something there. I heard a noise.
5614	5616	All right, Vince. Hit him in the head. Right between the eyes.
5620	5624	Good shot. Ok, he's dead. Let's go get him.
5624	5625	That's another one for the fire.
5647	5648	All right, send a wagon through...
5657	5659	Keep those dogs back off of those things.
5720	5724	Come ahead with the motorcycle, please. Let's go!
5728	5731	Hey Randy, light these torches over here.
