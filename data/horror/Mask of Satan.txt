15	18	The 17th century witnessed a violent and merciless battle
19	22	against hideous bloodthirsty creatures
22	25	who in the chronicles of that time were referred to as vampires.
26	28	Brothers found the courage to accuse their brothers,
29	30	and fathers their children,
30	35	lest the Earth never be cleansed of this horrible race of ferocious murderers.
36	37	But before putting them to death,
38	41	human justice anticipating divine justice,
41	44	branded forever the cursed flesh of those monsters
44	47	with the red hot mark of Satan.
67	71	Asa, from the lineage of the Princes of Vaida,
71	75	the Sacred College of the Primats of Moldavia
75	78	has declared you guilty.
78	81	I, head of the family of the Princes of Vaida,
83	86	in my capacity as Grand Inquisitor, sentence you,
87	90	and as your brother I repudiate you.
91	94	You have committed many sins
95	97	to satisfy your satanic love
97	101	for that servant of the Devil, Igor Javutich.
102	105	May God have mercy
105	107	on your soul
107	109	in this supreme moment.
109	111	Cover her face
111	113	with the mask of the Devil.
114	116	Nail it down!
117	120	May the cleansing flames reduce her to ashes
121	125	so that the wind will obliterate all traces of her existence.
152	153	Griabby!
153	155	It is I who repudiate you,
155	158	It is I who curses you in the name of the Devil.
159	162	Go ahead, nail me down!
163	166	You will never escape my claws, nor those of Satan
168	172	The unchained elements of the power of darkness are ready to strike you
172	173	Beware, Griabby!
174	175	My vengeance
175	178	will strike down you and your offspring,
178	181	because in the blood of your sons and the sons of your sons
181	183	I will continue to live, immortal!
184	188	They will restore to me the life that you now take from me.
188	194	I shall return to torment and destroy throughout the night of time.
207	213	MASK OF THE DEVIL
310	312	As if by the Devil's command,
312	314	the sudden fury of the elements
314	316	extinguishes the purifying flames.
318	322	The terrified people run from that cursed place.
323	324	And for all that long night,
325	329	the churchbells toll to keep away the spirits of evil.
334	338	When the storm dies down, Javutich's body
338	341	is buried in unconsecrated ground
341	343	in the graveyard for murderers.
345	347	And the corpse of the witch
347	350	is placed in the tomb of her ancestors.
360	365	TWO CENTURIES LATER
366	370	How much further is it to the crossroads of Mirgorod?
371	373	Six or seven versts, sir.
374	375	Did you hear that, Professor?
375	378	If we stop at Mirgorod, we'll never be able to reach Moscow by evening.
378	381	Yes, but it doesn't matter. We'll spend the night at the inn at Mirgorod,
382	383	with good smoked salmon and excellent vodka.
383	386	We will arrive at the Congress tomorrow.
387	389	But we'll miss the inauguration
390	394	and Professor Blistanov of Saint Petersburg's speech. It's such a pity.
395	397	How long have you had your degree?
397	400	For three years, and I have been assisting you for two.
400	403	When you have been in this profession twenty years,
403	406	you'll learn the true value of the small talk of the Congress.
413	415	Take the road through the forest, it's much shorter.
416	418	That is a bad route, no one takes it anymore.
418	420	You are afraid of the witch
420	423	Afraid, no. I fought against Napoleon,
424	426	but to tell you the truth,
426	431	I'd rather find myself face-to-face with that Frenchman than to meet up with a ghost.
431	434	This will help you to forget the ghosts.
435	436	Come on, let's get going.
465	466	What's causing that strange sound?
467	468	It's nothing, just the wind in the trees.
471	472	What's going on?
473	475	The trees are extending their branches to strangle me!
475	479	Try not to strangle yourself with that vodka.
496	498	Why is he driving so fast?
498	500	I guess it's a combination of my tip and his fear...
508	509	Is it serious?
510	514	No, no. Fortunately, it just slipped out of the socket. I'll have it fixed in no time.
514	515	Very well.
516	518	It certainly isn't very cheerful here,
518	520	and there's that sound on top of it...
522	523	It's coming from there. Let's see what it is.
565	570	That solves the mystery! It's the wind in the pipes of this broken-down organ.
573	575	What is happening, your Lordship?
575	577	Nothing! Continue your work!
648	651	More than a thousand years of battles, hates, and loves.
652	656	Now there's nothing but dust in these tombs.
656	660	Only the memories of old exploits remain here.
661	664	The history of ancient Moldavia is caught in these stones.
682	683	Andreï, come here!
689	692	It's the witch of the old legend. Do you see this bronze mask?
692	694	It was always placed on the face of a condemned witch
694	697	So she shall wear for all eternity her true face.
698	700	And why is this window there?
700	702	They thought that the witch might rise again,
702	706	and that the cross visible through the glass would keep her nailed down forever.
706	708	Hey, my Lords!
711	714	Where are you? I need someone to come and give me a hand!
714	716	Gentlemen, please don't leave me alone
716	717	in this infernal place.
720	724	He is frightened to death. Go and help him, will you? I want to have another look around.
724	726	Sure, I prefer it outside anyway.
726	729	There's no air in here, and it's a bit gloomy.
773	774	Professor!
776	777	Professor Kruvajan, What is happening?
778	779	Why did you fire? -Look here.
779	782	It threw itself at me.
782	784	That's very strange.
785	787	Usually bats fly away from human beings.
789	791	Let's go, Professor, we'll be better off outside.
792	794	Otherwise the coachman will be convinced he is right.
795	796	Wait.
813	814	What are you doing?
817	819	Almost intact after two centuries.
822	823	Professor, you are injured.
824	826	Actually, I hadn't noticed it.
827	830	A splinter of glass, just a few drops of blood...
832	834	Those empty eyes seem to be looking at us.
841	842	Let's go.
890	893	Who are you? What do you want?
894	896	I am Professor Choma Kruvajan,
896	898	and this is my assistant...
898	901	Dr. Andreï Gorobek.
902	906	I was walking in the park when I heard a shot. Why?
907	909	I killed a bat down in the crypt.
909	913	You must excuse us for taking the liberty of entering the chapel.
913	915	We thought it was an abandoned ruin,
915	917	and we couldn't resist our curiosity.
919	920	It's all so strange
920	922	and mysterious here.
923	925	Everything is going to ruins here.
926	928	My father, Prince Vaida,
928	931	Refuses to repair even this old chapel.
932	935	This place, in his eyes, is cursed.
935	937	My Lords, the wheel is ready, we can go now.
937	938	We're coming.
939	941	Please excuse us, Princess, but we have to go.
941	943	We still have five versts between us and Mirgorod.
944	946	We are spending the night there.
947	951	Allow me not to say 'goodbye' to you, I hope to see you again...
952	958	Thank you. I trust you will spend a good night at Mirgorod.
1005	1007	Did she bewitch you?
1009	1010	What sadness in her eyes!
1013	1014	And this?
1019	1021	A souvenir of the witch.
1141	1143	What a strange sound.
1144	1146	Like a voice breaking off.
1151	1154	Wolves! That's why in the forest today
1154	1157	we couldn't find any tracks of wild deer.
1158	1160	No, it's a different kind of howling.
1163	1164	Those are not wolves.
1170	1171	The gryphon moved.
1173	1175	Constantin! Katia!
1175	1176	-What is it? -Father?
1176	1178	It wasn't painted like this, was it?
1178	1180	It was alive for a moment, now it's dead again.
1180	1182	-What are you saying? -I'm certain of it.
1183	1185	Yes, Father is right, it wasn't in that position before.
1185	1188	Katia, you were always impressed by that portrait,
1189	1192	I don't know why.
1192	1194	That portrait is like a smoldering fire;
1194	1197	it burns with a mysterious secret life.
1197	1198	There is something different about her eyes, her hands...
1198	1201	Sometimes I'm afraid to go near it.
1204	1206	Katia, Constantin must be right.
1207	1209	My imagination is playing tricks on me.
1212	1214	Let's not talk about it anymore.
1220	1221	How cold it is.
1222	1225	The chill that seems to come out of the fireplace tonight penetrates my bones.
1226	1229	Why don't you get some sleep, Father? Your eyes are tired.
1230	1232	My eyes aren't tired...
1232	1234	my spirit is.
1235	1237	Go, go... I want to be alone now.
1237	1242	Good night.
1279	1281	Good night, my Lord.
1281	1283	No, wait...
1284	1286	How many years have you been serving in this house?
1286	1287	I was born here, my Lord.
1288	1289	Today is the feast of Saint George.
1292	1294	Do you know the legend of the curse that was placed on this castle?
1294	1299	Two centuries ago today, two people were executed for practicing witchcraft.
1300	1302	Princess Asa and her lover and accomplice,
1302	1305	Prince Javutich. The mask of Satan was nailed forever to their faces.
1306	1311	One century later, an earthquake destroyed only the ancient chapel
1311	1313	and the witch's sarcophagus was found split open,
1313	1316	as if Asa was trying to break out and accomplish her revenge.
1316	1319	In fact, on that night, Princess Macha
1319	1321	died mysteriously.
1323	1326	Beautiful Macha... the very image of the witch.
1331	1332	She was just twenty-one that day...
1335	1336	Like Katia.
1337	1339	And Katia is her living image.
1340	1345	As if the witch chooses her victims and torments them with her own beauty before killing them.
1345	1349	It is this resemblance, this echoing vengeance of Asa that terrifies me.
1350	1351	I am afraid, Ivan.
1351	1354	You musn't be afraid, my Lord. The cross will protect you.
1355	1359	Even if what you say is true, these creatures are terrified by the symbol of Christ.
1360	1362	Always keep it near you and you will be safe.
1362	1363	Yes. You are right, Ivan.
1364	1368	It is the atmosphere surrounding this cursed day that has upset me so.
1369	1371	Drink this, my Lord, before it gets cold.
1388	1389	It's Death!
1389	1391	I have just seen Death!
1391	1392	It's a warning.
1393	1396	I will defend myself! They won't win!
1397	1399	They won't win against the symbol of Christ!
1463	1464	-Everything alright, sir? -Yes, thank you.
1465	1468	You were right, Professor, this vodka is superb.
1468	1470	Right now I feel as if I could conquer the world.
1470	1475	Start with the castle. If I am not mistaken, someone made quite an impression on you.
1475	1478	An excellent idea! Another glass or two...
1481	1483	...and that's exactly where I'll go.
1484	1487	You'd be wiser to go to sleep. Mysterious princesses are easier to conquer in dreams.
1488	1490	Besides, we must be up early tomorrow.
1490	1491	You're right.
1492	1494	I'll tell them to wake us at five.
1494	1498	No, I'll do it. I will take a little walk and inform our hostess.
1498	1499	Alright, good night.
1501	1503	And watch out for bats!
1504	1506	Watch out for your head!
1518	1521	-Why is it always the same story with you? -I don't want to go there.
1521	1523	And who do you think should go? Me, with all the things I have to do?
1524	1527	Excuse me, sir, isn't it shameful that a girl of her age
1528	1529	is afraid to go by herself to milk the cow in the barn?
1530	1530	Your mother is right.
1531	1533	Yes, but the barn is right beside the old cemetery.
1534	1536	Don't be afraid of the dead. They hurt nobody.
1536	1538	Did you hear what the gentleman said?
1538	1540	I'm coming! Now hurry, I'm busy.
1541	1542	I've been waiting for half an hour.
1542	1543	I'll go tonight, but tomorrow I won't.
1609	1610	Hello, Irina.
1624	1627	Katia.
1633	1637	My daughter... You seem restless, bitter...
1637	1639	...sad. As if you feared something.
1640	1644	It's nothing. The arrival of Autumn always makes me feel sad.
1644	1649	And your smile has vanished. Do you want to leave the castle?
1649	1652	Do these old walls seem too sad to you?
1652	1654	No, I want to stay here.
1655	1657	The melancholy of this house helps me.
1658	1662	For centuries it has been our home, why change it now?
1664	1665	Here lies the past,
1667	1669	and all the memories of those who preceded us.
1671	1674	I should have taken you away when you were born, you and Constantin.
1675	1681	Taken you far away, protected you from the sadness of too many memories and regrets.
1682	1684	Maybe I would have been unhappy.
1684	1685	But not so lonely.
1687	1689	Can't I convince you?
1690	1692	You might convince me with a smile.
1693	1693	I...
1694	1694	You see?
1695	1699	-You are trembling as if a dark menace hung heavily over you. -Don't talk to me like that.
1702	1703	I am sorry, Father...
1703	1706	Tonight I will play for you as before.
1742	1744	Javutich!
1745	1748	Javutich, rise!
1782	1785	It's OK, Irina, be still... are you frightened too?
1787	1789	What a storm!
2109	2113	Papa, what is happening? It's me, Katia.
2114	2115	We must find a doctor, but where?
2116	2117	At the inn.
2118	2121	I met two doctors in front of the chapel today, they said they were staying at Mirgorod.
2121	2123	Hurry, Ivan! Go down and wake up the groom!
2124	2125	I'm here, master! What is happening?
2126	2128	Go to the inn and get one of the doctors who is staying there.
2169	2170	Doctor Kruvajan!
2173	2177	Princess Vaida sent me. She begs you to come to the castle.
2178	2180	I'll come, but first I'll have to notify the innkeepers.
2181	2181	You won't need to.
2182	2184	I have already done so. They told me
2184	2185	where to find you.
2188	2189	In that case...
2506	2507	Kruvajan!
2508	2509	I have been waiting for you.
2517	2518	I need you again.
2519	2520	Look into my eyes.
2522	2524	Look into my eyes!
2525	2527	Come closer.
2527	2530	Just a few drops of your blood
2530	2532	brought me to life again.
2532	2536	All of your blood will give me the strength to accomplish my vengeance.
2537	2539	Come... embrace me.
2540	2543	My lips will transform you.
2550	2554	You will be dead to men, but you'll be alive in death.
2605	2607	What's keeping Boris so long?
2607	2609	He will come. Have courage, Katia.
2613	2616	The griffon... The man in the painting...
2617	2619	-What's he saying? -He's delirious.
2621	2623	Only the crucifix can save us.
2624	2627	In this day of... damnation.
2637	2638	Did you send for me?
2641	2644	Thank you very much for coming, Doctor. He looks really bad.
2644	2646	We will see. You may go now.
2679	2680	What's wrong with him, Doctor?
2680	2683	Nothing serious. He has just been very emotional.
2683	2686	We were asleep when all of a sudden we heard him scream.
2686	2689	He was trembling, lying here with his arm outstretched, holding this cross...
2689	2692	...holding this cross as if trying to drive back some horrible apparition.
2692	2693	Don't show it.
2694	2697	If he sees it again, it might provoke another attack.
2699	2702	Eternity has been broken. You were able to do it!
2703	2706	You tore me out of the earth, heavy as lead.
2707	2709	You won't be alone anymore.
2709	2713	I will bring you her body, she will be your prey.
2714	2718	She was born for this fate. She is your living image.
2718	2721	Destiny has its way, Asa.
2722	2723	In her you will live again,
2724	2727	speak again, and smile as she does.
2728	2731	We will live once more, as we used to.
2745	2747	Go have some rest, Constantin. Father is quiet now.
2747	2749	No, I'm not tired.
2749	2751	Go, both of you. I will stay here.
2752	2755	Oh dear, the tormented barking of those dogs...
2755	2757	-Ivan, try to quiet them. -Yes, my Lady.
2758	2760	Go, Constantin. I'll sit up with him.
2762	2764	-I'll call you if necessary. -As you wish.
2771	2772	What's the matter?
2773	2774	Quiet now!
2814	2815	What is it?
2815	2817	I thought you were sleeping.
2817	2821	Why don't you go to bed now? I'll stay here and watch over your father.
2821	2823	But aren't you leaving tomorrow at dawn?
2823	2827	Don't worry, I'll stay with him all night long.
2834	2836	He is much calmer now, isn't he?
2836	2840	Yes, he will be sleeping quietly the rest of the night. You needn't worry.
2841	2844	Go and have some rest yourself now, you'll need it.
2844	2847	Doctor, I don't know how to thank you.
2848	2849	Call me if you need anything.
2850	2851	I'm sure it won't be necessary.
2851	2853	Your room is across the corridor here.
2854	2856	Goodnight, and thank you again.
2856	2857	Goodnight.
2888	2893	END OF PART ONE
2893	2894	PART TWO
2938	2939	Poor Father!
2941	2942	Doctor Kruvajan!
2946	2948	Katia wait! Don't go in there!
2949	2951	Don't look!
2956	2956	Professor Kruvajan?
2961	2962	It's me, Andreï.
2963	2965	Your friend has already left.
2966	2967	Left?
2967	2972	Last night he was called to the castle. It seems that Prince Vaida was suddenly taken very ill.
2972	2973	He hasn't come back.
2974	2976	And why didn't he notify me?
2976	2978	Maybe he didn't want to disturb you.
2978	2981	My daughter saw him get into the coach that came from the castle to pick him up.
2982	2984	-Could I have a horse? -Right away. Come with me.
2992	2994	Be careful! If you knock down the basket I'll spank you!
2997	2999	Excuse me!
2999	3002	Is this the shortcut to the castle?
3002	3005	Yes, sir. Take the road going uphill.
3007	3011	Damn it, I told you to play someplace else!
3013	3015	A shirt! We have to catch it!
3016	3018	Be careful you don't fall into the water too!
3052	3053	Doctor Kruvajan!
3072	3072	Who are you?
3073	3074	What do you want?
3074	3076	I am Doctor Gorobek.
3076	3079	I heard that Doctor Kruvajan was brought here last night.
3079	3081	That is correct.
3082	3085	We called him to attend to my father, who had fallen ill suddenly.
3085	3088	The doctor was left alone with him, but then he left.
3088	3093	If he hadn't abandoned him, my father might still be alive.
3093	3097	The behaviour of your colleague is really incomprehensible.
3098	3099	You're right.
3100	3104	I don't know how to explain it, but I assure you this comes to me as a great surprise.
3104	3107	I know Doctor Kruvajan very well,
3108	3110	and I don't understand...
3110	3111	Something serious must have happened, I'm sure of it.
3113	3117	It is very strange. He hasn't returned to the inn.
3117	3118	He hasn't returned?
3120	3121	Please, come up.
3124	3126	Oh my god! It's Boris, the groom from the Vaida's.
3127	3132	Yes, it's him, and what a state he's in! How did he end up here?
3133	3134	The current. He is dead.
3152	3154	Let's take her away from here. Where is her room?
3154	3155	Come.
3170	3171	Quickly, some water.
3225	3227	His face has changed completely.
3227	3231	It's very scary, it looks like the face of the Devil. It made me sick looking at it.
3231	3234	Horrible! It's as if the Devil had devoured him from within.
3234	3237	Speak quietly, it's better that they don't know yet.
3237	3239	They are already grief-stricken enough by their father's death.
3240	3241	Ivan! What's this all about?
3241	3244	They found Boris' body in the stream, my Lord.
3244	3245	Boris' body?
3245	3249	Yes, and in a terrible state. His eyes are popping out of their sockets,
3249	3251	his teeth are exposed, and his hands are contorted.
3253	3254	Where is he?
3255	3258	We've carried him into the sacristy. The parish priest is with him.
3259	3260	You there...
3260	3261	Me?
3262	3263	Yes, come here.
3266	3269	Is it true that you saw the carriage that came to fetch Doctor Kruvajan yesterday evening?
3269	3273	Yes, my Lord. I saw it when it left the stable.
3273	3275	When I heard the noise, I hid myself.
3275	3279	But it wasn't Boris who was driving the coach. I know him well.
3279	3282	It was a stranger, an unknown face.
3282	3283	Are you sure?
3283	3285	Yes, my Lord.
3286	3288	I'm going to the village to see Boris' corpse.
3289	3292	And you come with me. You must tell me everything. Everything that you saw.
3293	3295	Do you understand? It's very important.
3295	3297	Certainly sir, I'll tell you everything.
3298	3300	Come on now, go back to the village.
3303	3303	It's him!
3305	3306	Yes, it's him!
3307	3309	It's the man who came last night to get Doctor Kruvajan.
3310	3312	I swear it, my Lord, it's definitely him!
3312	3316	I am certain of it! The moon was shining on his face.
3316	3317	Airy chatter!
3318	3322	Fantasies about a portrait of someone who has been lying dead for centuries!
3322	3324	We're all going insane!
3325	3326	Calm yourself, Princess.
3327	3329	I am going to the village, but I'll be back.
3330	3331	Gather your courage.
3331	3333	Why don't you stay the night here, Doctor?
3335	3339	Yes, I beg you. We will all feel calmer.
3353	3355	Unbelievable!
3356	3358	The same horrible death as the prince.
3359	3361	The wounds on his neck look like the work of a wild beast...
3361	3364	...but one that punctures the flesh without tearing it.
3366	3369	I am a doctor, and I only believe in Science. But this...
3372	3374	And what about Professor Kruvajan?
3375	3377	Is it possible that a man such as he
3378	3381	could abandon a patient without saying anything?
3383	3386	I passed by the inn, but no one had seen him.
3386	3391	Moreover, the inkeeper's daughter swore that the man in the portrait at the castle
3391	3394	is the same as the driver of the coach who came last night to fetch the Professor.
3395	3396	I don't know how to explain it.
3397	3399	A man in a portrait, you say?
3399	3402	Yes, the portrait hanging near the fireplace.
3402	3404	A painting that is two centuries old.
3405	3408	Of a man dressed in black with a griffon on his chest?
3408	3410	Yes, why?
3415	3416	Oh... nothing...
3422	3423	Oh, Father,
3424	3427	The Prince would like you to prepare the funeral for tomorrow.
3428	3430	Very well. Everything will be ready tomorrow morning.
3565	3566	Help me!
3570	3571	What is happening?
3572	3573	What's the matter, Princess?
3573	3575	-There is someone in my room! -Where?
3575	3577	-Behind the curtain! -Let's go!
3577	3579	Ivan, keep guard over the stairway.
3582	3583	Over there, behind the curtain.
3591	3594	-There's nobody there. -You must have imagined it.
3594	3597	No, I saw a hand, reflected in the mirror.
3598	3603	Don't you believe me? I saw it!
3603	3604	I'll go and get a sedative.
3621	3624	Professor Kruvajan! You frightened me.
3625	3626	Where have you been?
3628	3629	I have been searching for you all day.
3632	3633	Your hair...
3634	3635	Go away, Andreï.
3635	3640	Don't get involved in things that don't concern you.
3640	3644	Since you didn't come back to the inn, I brought your luggage here for you.
3644	3645	Look...
3646	3648	I was trying to decipher the inscription.
3653	3654	Professor!
3678	3679	Krug! Brug!
3682	3684	They carry the signs.
3685	3687	Yes... and I think that maybe...
3687	3689	Come, quickly.
3689	3693	Carry everything into the salon for the funeral service.
3694	3695	Take this. Carefully.
3696	3698	He fled from you as if possessed?
3698	3700	Yes, the moment I showed him the icon.
3701	3703	He disappeared without any explanation.
3704	3708	It's very difficult to translate these ancient Cyrillic inscriptions.
3709	3711	We have to find the keyword.
3713	3717	Let me take it along to the library, where I can compare it with some texts I have.
3717	3718	At your disposal.
3718	3719	My Father...
3719	3722	My sister has been suffering terribly from all this,
3723	3728	I would really appreciate it if you would urge her to leave the castle.
3728	3734	I tried to convince her, but in vain...
3775	3776	Princess!
3779	3781	I hope I'm not intruding...
3782	3785	No, I just feel so desperate and alone.
3786	3787	I understand, but you mustn't despair.
3788	3792	You must always have faith. In yourself, in life.
3793	3794	In life?
3794	3797	What is my life? Sadness and grief.
3797	3800	Something that destroys itself, bit by bit.
3800	3802	And no one can rebuild it.
3803	3805	Here is the very image of my life.
3806	3808	Look at it...
3808	3812	it is being consumed, hour by hour, like this garden.
3814	3817	Destined for a life without purpose.
3817	3822	Even if all Mankind abandons this castle, or even deserts these grounds,
3823	3827	there is no reason why you should do likewise with your life and your youth.
3828	3832	Go far away from here, and you'll be happy again, Katia.
3834	3836	Forgive me if I call you by name.
3836	3839	And remember that I'll always be ready to help you.
3840	3842	You're very kind, Andreï,
3842	3844	but today everything seems so hopeless.
3845	3848	I feel a sense of terror, a premonition of death
3848	3852	that tortures me without giving me a single moment of peace.
3854	3856	If only I had your strength, your faith.
3857	3858	You mustn't despair.
3859	3862	Lately everything must seem very confusing to you.
3862	3864	But even here, in this garden,
3864	3868	the Sun will reach into the darkest corners and chase away the shadows of the night.
3871	3873	Help me.
3874	3876	Please, help me!
3917	3921	Without you, I wouldn't know how to survive this ordeal.
3922	3927	In moments like these, it's difficult to find the right words...
3928	3931	...but when this is all over, Katia...
3932	3936	Thank you Andreï, thank you very much.
3938	3940	Forgive me, but it was threatening to set the whole place on fire.
3941	3942	Strange...
3942	3944	Who knows what's behind there?
3944	3945	Doctor!
3946	3949	When Ivan was putting out a fire that started in the hanging,
3949	3951	he ripped through this canvas. Look!
3952	3953	Be careful.
3960	3962	It's completely dark here.
3974	3975	A secret passage!
3977	3979	Then my father was not delirious.
3980	3981	His last words were:
3982	3984	"The silver griffin... the man in the portrait..."
3985	3989	And this is where I found the dogs with their throats sliced after Kruvajan disappeared .
3990	3990	Let's go.
3995	3998	Stand guard here, Ivan, and make sure the door doesn't close.
3998	3999	Yes, sir.
4011	4013	It's the same face as the portrait in the salon.
4015	4016	It's the witch!
4017	4018	How did you know about her?
4019	4022	I saw her when Doctor Kruvajan and I visited the crypt.
4024	4025	Hold this!
4082	4085	Two days ago, the sarcophagus was untouched, and the witch...
4085	4087	She looks as if she has just died.
4088	4088	Look!
4090	4091	She is breathing!
4091	4095	What a terrifying phenomenon! I'm going to fetch the priest!
4095	4097	Return to the castle and don't leave Katia alone. Quick, we don't have any time to lose!
4098	4101	Go that way, you'll get to the stables quicker.
4133	4135	After all you have told me, everything is clear.
4136	4139	We are facing the unleashed powers of the Devil.
4139	4142	The ancient words on the icon explain exactly what must be done.
4142	4144	We must find the grave of Javutich...
4144	4146	before sunset!
4194	4195	Father!
4197	4198	The Mask of Satan.
4199	4201	Like the one I saw over the witch's face.
4201	4203	It's just as I thought.
4204	4205	We will find him here.
4208	4210	Look! A freshly dug grave!
4212	4213	Open the coffin!
4234	4235	Doctor Kruvajan!
4236	4237	But last night,
4238	4239	he was still alive.
4241	4242	I saw him!
4242	4244	No, he was already dead.
4245	4246	But it's impossible, Father.
4247	4250	He moved, he even spoke to me, and then he ran away.
4252	4256	Sometimes Satan, with his great capacity for doing evil,
4256	4258	even plays tricks with the dead.
4268	4269	You see?
4270	4272	Here is the proof.
4273	4277	Now we have to find a way to let his soul to rest in peace.
4277	4279	How?
4281	4283	The inscription on the icon...
4284	4286	...indicates the only way.
4293	4296	The spell is broken.
4296	4298	Poor Kruvajan.
4301	4302	We have to act.
4303	4305	Quickly, now that everything is clear.
4305	4309	The witch turned your friend into a slave of the Devil.
4310	4313	Dead during the day, but alive by night.
4313	4317	So he could carry out the malignant orders of his master.
4317	4319	Then the Princess, too...
4319	4321	Yes. We have no time to lose,
4321	4324	or the witch may regain her life.
4325	4325	How?
4326	4328	By possessing the body of another young woman.
4329	4329	Katia!
4329	4330	Yes, Katia.
4331	4333	Run to the castle. It's already late!
4333	4336	Before the sun goes down, you must pierce the left eye of the witch.
4337	4341	Go now. I will do the same to the body of Boris, which is still in the sacristy...
4341	4343	...and then I'll join you.
4348	4350	Constantin! Ivan!
4378	4379	Is anyone there?
4379	4381	Where is everyone?
4391	4394	Help me!
4404	4406	Where are you?
4419	4421	Help me, Father! Help me!
4422	4425	Don't leave me alone with all these horrors!
4456	4460	I'm no longer your father. My blood is no longer your blood.
4460	4465	The spirits of evil have broken that tie between us forever. Cursed fluids flow through your body!
4530	4532	Constantin! Ivan!
4532	4534	Open up!
4538	4541	Your vengeance is at hand, Asa.
4542	4544	Finally the hour of our freedom strikes.
4555	4557	Where are you?
4663	4666	You are ignoring the fact that you were born for this moment,
4666	4671	and that your life has been consecrated to me by Satan.
4671	4673	But you sensed it, didn't you?
4673	4675	You sensed it.
4675	4677	That's why my portrait fascinated
4677	4679	and terrified you.
4679	4682	You felt that your life and body were mine.
4682	4685	You felt like me because you were destined to become me.
4686	4688	A living corpse.
4690	4693	The love of that young man could have saved you from this curse, you know.
4693	4698	But I was stronger. Now you will enjoy a beautiful new life,
4699	4701	full of evil and hate, with me.
4765	4768	-Constantin. -Don't worry about me.
4769	4772	Save Katia. Don't lose time.
4773	4775	Save Katia from the witch.
4798	4801	Katia, thank God I have arrived in time!
4802	4804	She wanted to kill me.
4804	4806	Do something before it's too late.
4806	4809	I couldn't do it. Quickly.
4810	4813	Yes, you are right. We must destroy her.
4814	4815	Now I know how it can be done.
4821	4824	Don't look, it's horrible, but there is no other way.
4849	4850	But... this is your cross.
4851	4855	Katia... How is this possible?
4865	4866	I understand.
4867	4869	Come...
4872	4874	I am not your love.
4874	4878	There she lies, devastated, lost forever.
4878	4881	My vengeance is complete.
4881	4884	Her entire family has been annihilated.
4885	4889	Look at me, Andreï. Look into my eyes,
4889	4892	like Kruvajan did that night.
4892	4894	and like him, lose yourself deep in my eyes.
4896	4899	You too will feel the immense joy of hating.
4899	4901	Look at me.
4905	4907	She, she is the witch.
4907	4911	Don't be deceived by her face. Look at her body.
4911	4913	She is transforming herself into Katia
4913	4914	by draining her life's blood.
4957	4960	Two centuries ago, a storm prevented the flames
4960	4962	from destroying the wicked soul of the witch.
4963	4966	Today, her innocent victims
4968	4972	have broken the spell.
4977	4977	Why...
4978	4980	Why was she taken away from me, Father?
4984	4987	Katia's beauty is dying with her.
4993	4995	My life has finally come to an end.
4997	4999	How can I ever forget?
5000	5002	How can I resign myself?
5003	5005	I will never find peace again.
5008	5009	Look...
5009	5011	her young body, destroyed.
5035	5037	Father!
