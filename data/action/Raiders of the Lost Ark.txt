131	133	The Hovitos are near.
134	136	The poison is still fresh,three days.
136	138	They're following us.
139	143	If they knew we were here,they would've killed us already.
224	227	This is it.
227	228	This is where Forrestalcashed in.
228	230	A friend of yours?
230	231	A competitor.
231	233	He was good.
233	234	He was very, very good.
235	238	Senor... nobody'scome out of there alive.
238	240	Please...
275	277	Senor.
305	306	Stop.
306	308	Stay out of the light.
329	332	Forrestal.
376	378	Let us hurry.There is nothing to fear here.
380	382	That's what scares me.
400	401	Stay here.
401	403	If you insist, senor.
486	487	Give me the whip.
487	489	Throw me the idol.
491	492	No time to argue.
492	494	Throw me the idol,I throw you the whip.
495	496	Give me the whip!
496	498	Adios, senor.
539	541	Adios, Satipo.
579	581	Dr. Jones.
581	584	Again we see there is nothingyou can possess
584	585	which I cannot take away.
586	588	And you thought I had given up.
598	600	You chose the wrong friends.
600	602	This time, it will cost you.
604	606	Too bad the Hovitos...
607	610	don't know you the way I do,Belloq.
610	611	Yes, too bad.
611	613	You could warn them,
613	616	if only you spoke Hovitos.
661	662	Jock! Start the engines!
662	664	Get it up!
668	670	Jock, the engines!
670	672	Start the engines, Jock!
719	722	There's a big snakein the plane, Jock!
722	725	Oh, that's justmy pet snake Reggie!
725	727	I hate snakes, Jock!
727	728	I hate 'em!
729	732	Come on!Show a little backbone, will ya?
747	749	"Neo," meaning "new"
749	752	and "lithic"... l- T-H...
753	755	...l- C, meaning "stone."
755	757	All right, let's get backto this site:
757	759	Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.
759	764	Contains a central pas-passageand three chambers, or cysts...
768	772	...don't confuse that withrobbing, in which case we mean
772	775	the removal of the contentsof the barrow.
775	777	This site also demonstrates...
778	781	...one of the great dangersof archaeology...
781	784	not to life and limb, althoughthat does sometimes take place...
784	786	no, I'm talking about folklore.
787	788	In this case,local tradition held
788	791	that there was golden coffinburied at the site,
791	794	and this accounts for the holesdug all over the barrow
794	797	and the generally poor conditionof the find.
797	800	However, chamber threewas undisturbed,
800	802	and the undisturbed chamberand the grave goods
802	803	that were found in another, uh...
803	806	in the area, give us a r...
807	808	Uh...
810	812	...reason to da...to, uh, to-to date this,
812	814	uh, find as we have.
814	815	Um...
816	817	Any questions, then?
818	819	No? Okay, that's itfor the day, then.
819	821	Um, don't forget...
821	825	Michaelson, chapters fourand five for next time.
825	827	And I will be in my officeon Thursday, but not Wednesday.
837	839	I had it, Marcus.
839	841	I had it in my hand.
841	842	What happened?
842	844	Guess.
845	846	Belloq?
846	847	You want to hear about it?
847	848	Not at all.
848	850	I'm sure everything you dofor the museum
850	852	conforms tothe International Treaty
852	853	for the Protectionof Antiquities.
853	855	It's beautiful, Marcus.
855	856	I can get it.
856	857	I got it all figured out.
857	858	There's only one placehe can sell it: Marrakech.
858	859	I need $2,000. Look...
860	860	Listen to me, old boy.
860	862	I brought some peopleto see you.
862	863	Look.
863	864	I got these pieces.
864	865	They're good pieces, Marcus.
865	867	- Look.- Indiana...
868	870	Yes, the museum will buy them,as usual, no questions asked.
870	872	Yes, they are nice.They're worth at least
872	873	the priceof a ticket to Marrakech.
873	874	But the peopleI brought are important,
875	875	and they're waiting.
875	876	What people?
876	878	Army Intelligence.
878	880	They knew you were comingbefore I did.
880	881	Seem to know everything.
881	883	They wouldn't tell mewhat they want.
883	885	Well, what do I wantto see them for?
885	887	What am I, in trouble?
887	888	Yes, Dr. Jones,
888	890	we've heard a great dealabout you.
890	891	Have you?
892	894	Uh, professor of archaeology,
894	895	expert on the occult,
895	897	and, uh, how does one say it?
897	900	Obtainer of rare antiquities.
900	901	That's one way of saying it.
901	902	Why don't you sit down?
902	903	You'll be more comfortable.
903	904	- Oh, thank you.- Thank you.
904	907	Yes, you're a manof many talents.
907	909	Now, you studiedunder Professor Ravenwood
909	911	at the University of Chicago.
911	913	Yes, I did.
913	916	You have no ideaof his present whereabouts?
916	919	Uh... well, just rumors, really.
919	920	Somewhere in Asia, I think.
920	922	I haven't really spokento him for ten years.
922	924	We were friends, but, uh...
924	926	had a bit of a falling out,I'm afraid.
927	928	Mmm.
928	930	Dr. Jones, now,you must understand
931	933	that this is allstrictly confidential, eh?
934	934	I understand.
935	936	Uh...
937	940	Yesterday afternoon,our European sections
940	943	intercepted a...a German communique
943	946	that was sentfrom Cairo to Berlin.
946	948	- Now, to Cairo...- See, over the last two years,
948	949	the Nazis have had teamsof archaeologists
949	950	running around the world
951	953	looking for all kindsof religious artifacts.
954	955	Hitler's a nut on the subject.
955	956	He's crazy.
956	958	He's obsessed with the occult.
958	960	And, right now, apparently,
960	962	there's some kindof German archaeological dig
962	963	going on in the desertoutside of Cairo.
964	966	Now, we've got someinformation here,
966	968	but we can't make anythingout of it, and maybe you can.
968	972	"Tanis development proceeding.
972	976	"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.
976	979	Abner Ravenwood, U.S. "
980	982	The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
982	985	Just what does that mean to you,uh, Tanis?
985	986	Well, it...
986	987	The city of Tanisis one of the possible
987	988	resting places of the Lost Ark.
988	990	The Lost Ark?
990	991	Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.
991	992	The chest the Hebrews used
992	994	to carry aroundthe Ten Commandments.
994	995	What do you mean,"commandments"?
995	997	You talkingabout the Ten Commandments?
997	998	Yes, the actualTen Commandments.
998	999	The original stone tablets
999	1002	that Moses brought downout of Mount Horeb and smashed,
1002	1004	if you believein that sort of thing.
1005	1007	Any of you guysever go to Sunday school?
1007	1008	Well, I...
1008	1009	Oh, look.
1009	1010	The Hebrews tookthe broken pieces
1010	1011	and put them in the Ark.
1012	1013	When they settled in Canaan,
1013	1015	they put the Ark in a placecalled the Temple of Solomon.
1015	1016	In Jerusalem.
1016	1018	Where it stayed for many years.
1018	1020	Until, all of a sudden,whoosh, it's gone.
1020	1021	Where?
1021	1023	Well, nobody knowswhere or when.
1023	1025	However, an Egyptian pharaoh...
1025	1026	- Shishak.- Yes.
1026	1029	...invaded the city of Jerusalemright about 980 BC,
1029	1032	and he may have taken the Arkback to the city of Tanis
1032	1033	and hidden itin a secret chamber
1034	1035	called the Well of Souls.
1035	1036	Secret chamber?
1037	1038	However, about a year
1038	1040	after the pharaohwould return to Egypt,
1040	1043	the city of Tanis wasconsumed by the desert
1044	1046	in a sandstorm whichlasted a whole year.
1047	1049	Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
1051	1052	Uh-huh.
1052	1054	Obviously, we've cometo the right men.
1054	1056	Now you seem to know, uh,
1056	1057	all about this Tanis, then.
1057	1059	No, no, not really.
1059	1061	Ravenwood is the real expert.
1061	1063	Abner did the first serious workon Tanis.
1063	1065	Collected some of its relics.
1065	1068	It was his obsession, really.
1068	1069	But he never found the city.
1070	1073	Frankly, we're somewhatsuspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.
1073	1074	An American being mentionedso prominently
1075	1077	in a secret Nazi cable.
1077	1078	Oh, rubbish.
1078	1079	Ravenwood's no Nazi.
1079	1081	Well, what do the Naziswant him for, then?
1081	1083	Well, obviously,the Nazis are looking
1083	1085	for the headpieceto the Staff of Ra
1085	1086	and they think Abner's got it.
1087	1090	What exactly is a headpieceto the Staff of Ra?
1090	1091	Well, the staffis just a stick...
1091	1092	I don't know, about this big,
1093	1094	nobody really knowsfor sure how high...
1094	1097	and it's... it's, uh...it's capped
1097	1100	with an elaborate headpiece...
1100	1103	in the shape of the sun,with a crystal in the center.
1103	1104	And what you did was
1104	1107	you take the staffto a special room in Tanis...
1107	1108	a map room with a miniature
1108	1110	of the city all laid outon the floor...
1110	1112	and if you put the staffin a certain place,
1112	1115	at a certain time of day,the sun shone through here
1115	1117	and made a beam that came downon the floor here...
1118	1121	and gave you the exact locationof the Well of the Souls.
1121	1124	Where the Ark of the Covenantwas kept, right?
1124	1125	Which is exactly what the Nazisare looking for.
1126	1129	What does this Ark look like?
1129	1130	Uh...
1130	1132	There's a picture of itright here.
1136	1138	That's it.
1144	1145	Good God.
1146	1148	Yes, that's justwhat the Hebrews thought.
1148	1149	Uh...
1149	1152	now, what's that supposed to becoming out of there?
1152	1153	Lightning...
1154	1155	fire...
1156	1158	power of God or something.
1159	1160	I'm beginning to understand
1161	1162	Hitler's interest in this.
1162	1163	Oh, yes.
1163	1165	The Bible speaks of theArk leveling mountains,
1165	1169	and laying wasteto entire regions.
1169	1173	An army which carriesthe Ark before it...
1173	1174	is invincible.
1194	1196	You did it, didn't you?
1196	1198	They want you to go for it.
1198	1200	Oh, Marcus!
1200	1203	They want you to get ahold ofthe Ark before the Nazis do
1203	1205	and they're preparedto pay handsomely for it.
1205	1206	And the museum?
1206	1207	The museum gets the Arkwhen we're finished?
1207	1209	Oh, yes.
1210	1213	Oh...
1213	1215	The Ark of the Covenant.
1215	1218	Nothing else has come close.
1218	1219	That thing represents everything
1219	1221	we got into archaeologyfor in the first place.
1223	1225	Mmm!
1225	1228	You know, five years ago,I would've gone after it myself.
1228	1230	I'm really rather envious.
1230	1231	I've got to locate Abner.
1232	1233	I think I know where to start.
1238	1240	Suppose she'llstill be with him?
1240	1241	Possibly, but...
1242	1244	Marion's the leastof your worries right now,
1244	1246	believe me, Indy.
1246	1248	What do you mean?
1248	1251	Well, I mean thatfor nearly 3,000 years,
1251	1254	man has been searchingfor the Lost Ark.
1254	1258	Not something to be takenlightly.
1258	1262	No one knows its secrets.
1262	1265	It's like nothing you've evergone after before.
1267	1268	Oh, Marcus.
1268	1269	What are you trying to do,scare me?
1269	1270	You sound like my mother.
1270	1271	We've known each otherfor a long time.
1271	1272	I don't believe in magic,
1272	1274	a lot of superstitioushocus-pocus.
1275	1275	I'm going after a find
1276	1277	of incrediblehistorical significance.
1278	1279	You're talkingabout the bogeyman.
1279	1282	Besides, you knowwhat a cautious fellow I am.
1293	1294	Nice to see you again,Dr. Jones.
1294	1295	Thank you.
1365	1367	Shh... shh...
1384	1386	Shh...
1415	1417	Give him space!Give him space!
1417	1419	Go on, Regan!
1420	1423	Shh! Shh!
1423	1424	Shh! Shh! Shh!
1467	1469	Hello, Marion.
1475	1478	Indiana Jones.
1480	1481	Always knew, someday,
1481	1483	you'd come walking backthrough my door.
1484	1485	I never doubted that.
1486	1488	Something made it inevitable.
1488	1490	So, what are you doing herein Nepal?
1491	1493	I need one of the piecesyour father collected.
1494	1496	I learned to hate youin the last ten years.
1497	1499	I never meant to hurt you.
1499	1500	I was a child.
1500	1501	I was in love.
1501	1503	It was wrong and you knew it!
1503	1504	You knew what you were doing.
1504	1505	Now I do!
1505	1506	This is my place.
1506	1507	Get out!
1510	1511	I did what I did.
1511	1512	You don't have to be happyabout it,
1513	1514	but maybe we could helpeach other out now.
1516	1518	I need one of the piecesyour father collected.
1518	1519	Bronze piece, about this size,
1520	1521	with a hole in it, off-center,with a crystal.
1521	1522	You know the one I mean?
1523	1524	Yeah.
1525	1526	I know it.
1526	1527	Where's Abner?
1528	1529	Where's Abner?
1530	1531	Abner's dead.
1536	1538	Marion, I'm sorry.
1538	1541	Do you know what you did to me,to my life?
1541	1544	I can only sayI'm sorry so many times.
1544	1545	Well, say it again, anyway.
1545	1546	Sorry.
1546	1548	Yeah, everybody's sorry.
1548	1551	Abner was sorry for dragging meall over this earth
1551	1553	lookingfor his little bits of junk.
1553	1555	I'm sorry to still bestuck in this dive.
1555	1558	Everybody's sorry for something.
1558	1560	It's a worthless bronzemedallion, Marion.
1560	1561	You going to give it to me?
1561	1562	Maybe.
1562	1564	I don't know where it is.
1564	1567	Well, maybe you could find it.
1567	1570	3,000 bucks.
1570	1573	Well, that will get me back,but not in style.
1573	1576	I can get you another twowhen we get to the States.
1576	1578	It's important, Marion.
1578	1580	Trust me.
1581	1583	You know the piece I mean?
1583	1585	Do you know where it is?
1588	1590	Come back tomorrow.
1590	1592	Why?
1592	1596	Because I said so, that's why.
1602	1603	Ha!
1603	1605	See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.
1670	1672	Good evening, Fraulein.
1672	1674	The bar's closed.
1674	1677	We... We are...
1677	1679	not thirsty.
1679	1680	What do you want?
1680	1683	The same thing your friendDr. Jones wanted.
1683	1686	Surely he told youthere would be
1686	1687	other interested parties.
1687	1690	Must've slipped his mind.
1690	1693	The man is... nefarious.
1693	1697	I hope, for your sake,he has not yet acquired it.
1698	1700	Why, are you willingto offer more?
1700	1702	Oh, almost certainly.
1703	1704	Do you still have it?
1710	1711	No.
1711	1714	But I know where it is.
1715	1718	Hey, how about a drinkfor you and your men?
1718	1723	Your fire is dying here.
1723	1725	Why don't you tell mewhere the piece is right now?
1725	1727	Listen, Herr Mac...
1729	1732	I don't know what kind of peopleyou're used to dealing with,
1732	1734	but nobody tells mewhat to do in my place.
1734	1738	Fraulein Ravenwood,
1738	1741	let me show youwhat I am used to.
1743	1747	Take your hands off me!
1748	1751	Take your lousy hands off!
1757	1758	Wait a minute.
1758	1759	Wait, I... I can be reasonable.
1759	1761	That time is passed.
1761	1763	You don't need that.
1765	1766	Wait...
1767	1769	I'll tell you everything.
1769	1773	Yes, I know you will.
1778	1779	Let her go.
1851	1852	Whiskey.
1861	1862	Shoot them.
1863	1864	Shoot them both.
1917	1918	My medallion!
1926	1928	Well, Jones, at leastyou haven't forgotten
1928	1930	how to show a lady a good time!
1930	1931	Boy, you're something!
1931	1932	Yeah, I'll tell you what.
1933	1934	Until I get back my $5,000,
1935	1936	you're going to get morethan you bargained for.
1937	1940	I'm your goddamn partner!
1975	1977	Cairo, city of the living.
1978	1979	A paradise on earth.
1981	1982	Silence!
1982	1984	Why do you forget yourselves?
1984	1985	What is this?
1985	1987	Where did this animal come from?
1990	1991	Oh... oh, no.
1994	1995	Cute.
1995	1997	What an adorable creature.
1999	2001	Then it shall be welcomein our house.
2001	2004	Oh, well, no, you don't have tokeep it here just because of me.
2011	2014	I knew the Germanswould hire you, Sallah.
2014	2016	You're the best digger in Egypt.
2016	2019	My services are entirelyinconsequential to them.
2019	2022	They've hired or shanghaiedevery digger in Cairo.
2022	2024	The excavation is enormous.
2024	2028	They hire only strong backsand they pay pennies for them.
2028	2031	It's as if the pharaohshad returned.
2031	2033	When did they find the map room?
2033	2034	Three days ago.
2034	2036	They have not one brainamong them.
2036	2038	Except one.
2039	2041	He is very clever.He's a French archaeologist.
2043	2044	What's his name?
2044	2045	They call him "Bellosh."
2052	2054	Belloq. Belloq.
2054	2057	The Germans havea great advantage over us.
2057	2060	They are near to discoveringthe Well of Souls.
2060	2064	Well, they're notgoing to find it without this.
2065	2067	Who can tell usabout these markings?
2070	2072	Perhaps a man I knowcan help us.
2074	2075	Indy...
2077	2079	there is somethingthat troubles me.
2080	2082	What is it?
2082	2084	The Ark.
2084	2087	If it is there, at Tanis,
2087	2090	then it is something that manwas not meant to disturb.
2090	2093	Death has always surrounded it.
2093	2095	It is not of this earth.
2095	2097	Do we need the monkey, huh?
2097	2098	I'm surprised at you, Jones...
2098	2101	talking that way about our baby.
2101	2102	He's got your looks, too.
2102	2103	And your brains.
2103	2105	Oops!
2105	2106	I noticed that.
2106	2109	She's a smart little thing...smart.
2111	2113	Hey!
2113	2114	Hey, where you going?
2114	2116	She'll be all right.Have a date.
2119	2120	Come on. Come on.
2121	2121	Okay...
2122	2122	Marion.
2123	2123	What's this?
2124	2125	It's a date.
2125	2126	You eat 'em.
2173	2175	How come you haven't found somenice girl to settle down with,
2176	2177	raise eight or nine kids,like your friend Sallah?
2177	2178	Who says I haven't?
2180	2181	I do.
2182	2183	Dad had you figureda long time ago.
2192	2193	He said you were a bum.
2194	2195	Oh, he's being generous.
2195	2197	The most gifted bumhe ever trained.
2197	2199	You know, he loved youlike a son.
2199	2201	Took a hell of a lotfor you to alienate him.
2201	2202	Not much, just you.
2219	2221	Marion, get out of here!
2221	2222	Duck!
2262	2263	Right.
2304	2306	Shh! Shh!
2312	2313	Marion!
2333	2335	Help! Over here, Indy!
2335	2336	Get out of the way!
2336	2338	Move! Move it!
2339	2340	Help me!
2345	2346	You can't do this to me!
2347	2348	I'm an American!
2348	2350	Indy!
2354	2355	Indiana Jones!
2355	2357	Help me, Jones!
2377	2377	Jones!
2378	2378	Marion!
2382	2384	Indy!
2424	2426	Marion...
2462	2464	Dr. Jones.
2489	2491	You looking for me?
2499	2501	Belloq.
2501	2502	Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.
2502	2504	I ought to kill you right now.
2504	2507	Not a very private placefor a murder.
2508	2510	Well, these Arabs don't careif we kill each other.
2510	2513	They're not goingto interfere in our business.
2514	2516	It was not I who broughtthe girl into this business.
2516	2518	Please, sit downbefore you fall down.
2518	2521	We can at least behavelike civilized people.
2531	2533	I see your taste in friendsremains consistent.
2533	2536	How odd that it should endthis way for us,
2536	2539	after so manystimulating encounters.
2539	2541	I almost regret it.
2541	2543	Where shall I finda new adversary
2543	2544	so close to my own level?
2545	2547	Try the local sewer.
2549	2552	You and I are very much alike.
2552	2554	Archaeology is our religion,
2554	2558	yet we have both fallenfrom the purer faith.
2559	2562	Our methods have not differedas much as you pretend.
2562	2565	I am a shadowyreflection of you.
2565	2568	It would take only a nudgeto make you like me,
2568	2570	to push you out of the light.
2570	2573	Now you're getting nasty.
2574	2576	You know it's true.
2576	2577	How nice.
2578	2579	Look at this.
2580	2581	It's worthless.
2581	2584	Ten dollarsfrom a vendor in the street.
2584	2585	But I take it,
2585	2586	I bury it in the sandfor a thousand years,
2586	2590	it becomes priceless...like the Ark.
2590	2592	Men will kill for it.
2592	2594	Men like you and me.
2595	2597	What about your boss,der Fuehrer?
2598	2601	I thought he was waitingto take possession.
2601	2604	All in good time.
2604	2606	When I am finished with it.
2606	2609	Jones, do you realizewhat the Ark is?
2610	2611	It's a transmitter.
2612	2614	It's a radiofor speaking to God.
2614	2616	And it's within my reach.
2617	2621	You want to talk to God?
2621	2623	Let's go see Him together.
2623	2625	I've got nothing better to do.
2626	2628	Uncle Indy, come back home now!
2630	2631	Uncle Indy!
2632	2634	Next time, Indiana Jones,
2634	2636	it'll take more than childrento save you.
2638	2639	Uncle Indy!
2653	2654	I thought I wouldfind you there.
2654	2656	Better than the UnitedStates Marines, eh?
2665	2667	Marion's dead.
2667	2668	Yes, I know.
2668	2670	And me! And me!
2670	2672	I'm sorry.
2672	2673	Life goes on, Indy.
2673	2675	There is the proof.
2677	2679	Uh-oh.
2679	2680	I have much to tell you.
2680	2683	First we will take them home,
2683	2684	and then I will take youto the old man.
2733	2735	I can't figure outhow Belloq did it.
2736	2738	Where'd he get a copyof the headpiece?
2738	2741	There are no pictures,no duplicates of it anywhere.
2741	2744	I tell you only what I sawwith my own eyes:
2744	2745	A headpiece like that one,
2745	2748	except round the edges,which were rougher.
2748	2750	In the center, the Frenchmanhad embedded a crystal,
2750	2754	and... and surroundingthe crystal, on one side,
2754	2756	there were raised markings,just like that one.
2758	2761	They made their calculationsin the map room?
2761	2762	This morning.
2762	2764	Belloq and the boss German,Dietrich.
2764	2767	When they came outof the map room,
2767	2769	they gave us a new spotin which to dig,
2769	2772	out away from the camp.
2772	2774	The Well of the Souls, huh?
2774	2777	Come, come, look.Look here... look.
2778	2779	Sit down.
2779	2781	Come, sit down.
2781	2782	What is it?
2783	2785	This is a warning
2785	2787	not to disturbthe Ark of the Covenant.
2787	2789	What about the heightof the staff, though?
2789	2790	Did Belloq get it off of here?
2790	2791	Yes.
2791	2792	It is here.
2792	2794	This were the old way,
2794	2796	this mean six kadam high.
2797	2798	- About 72 inches.- Wait!
2801	2804	"And take back one kadam
2804	2808	to honor the Hebrew Godwhose Ark this is. "
2819	2821	You said their headpieceonly had markings on one side.
2821	2823	Are you absolutely sure?
2825	2826	Belloq's staff is too long.
2827	2829	They're diggingin the wrong place.
2832	2834	I am the monarch of the sea
2834	2836	I am the ruler of the...
2846	2848	Bad dates.
2862	2864	I told you not to be premature
2865	2867	in your communique to Berlin.
2867	2870	Archaeology is notan exact science.
2870	2872	It does not dealin time schedules.
2872	2874	The fuehrer is nota patient man.
2874	2877	He demands constant reports,and he expects progress.
2877	2879	You led me to believe...
2879	2880	Nothing!I made no promises.
2880	2882	I only saidit looked very favorable.
2882	2885	Besides, with the informationin our possession,
2886	2887	my calculations were correct.
2888	2889	Boy, they're not kidding,are they?
2891	2893	What time does the sunhit the map room?
2893	2895	At about 9:00 in the morning.
2895	2896	Not much time, then.
2896	2899	Where are they diggingfor the Well of the Souls?
2899	2902	On that ridge...but the map room's over there.
2902	2903	Let's go, come on.
3140	3141	Sallah.
3142	3144	Sallah!
3152	3153	They're here.
3163	3164	Please, my friend,what is the matter?
3165	3166	I fetch the water.I shall get it for you.
3169	3171	If you want water,I will get you water.
3171	3172	No problem, no problem.
3186	3187	I thought you were dead.
3187	3189	You must have switched baskets.
3193	3194	Are you hurt?
3194	3197	No. You have to get meout of here, quick.
3197	3199	They're gonna be backat any minute.
3199	3200	Cut me loose.
3200	3201	Quick.
3201	3203	They keep asking about you.What you know.
3208	3209	What's wrong?
3209	3210	Cut me loose.
3210	3212	I know where the Ark is, Marion.
3212	3214	The Ark's here?
3214	3215	I'm coming with you, Jones.Get me out of here!
3216	3217	Cut me loose!You can't leave me here!
3217	3218	If I take you out of here now,
3218	3219	they'll start combingthe place for us.
3219	3221	Jones, you've got to get meout of here!
3221	3223	Come on, Jones, are you crazy?!
3224	3225	Marion, I hate to do this,
3225	3227	but if you don't sitstill and keep quiet,
3228	3230	this whole thingis going to be shot.
3231	3233	I'll be back to get you.
3233	3234	Jones, what's the matter?
3278	3280	That's it.
3280	3281	Who knows?
3281	3283	Perhaps the Ark is still waiting
3283	3285	in some antechamberfor us to discover.
3285	3289	Perhaps there's some vitalbit of evidence which eludes us.
3289	3290	Perhaps...
3290	3292	Perhaps the girl can help us.
3292	3293	My feeling exactly.
3293	3296	She was in possessionof the original piece for years.
3296	3298	She may know much,if properly motivated.
3299	3301	I tell you,the girl knows nothing.
3302	3304	I'm surprisedto find you squeamish.
3304	3305	That is not your reputation.
3305	3307	But it needn't concern you.
3307	3309	I have the perfect manfor this kind of work.
3314	3316	Heil Hitler.
3395	3396	Indy! Here!
3396	3398	We've hit stone!
3401	3403	Clear it off.
3403	3404	Come on, find the edges.
3420	3422	Good, good, good.
3422	3423	You see, Indy? You see?
3423	3425	Okay, bring the pry bars in.
3425	3427	As a team, boys! As a team!
3429	3430	Push!
3435	3436	Get 'em in there.
3436	3437	Get 'em under.
3437	3438	Good, good, that's it.
3438	3439	Watch your toes.
3446	3448	Carefully, carefully!
3459	3461	Sorry, Indy.
3462	3464	Indy...
3464	3467	why does the floor move?
3468	3470	Give me your torch.
3499	3501	Snakes.
3501	3503	Why did it have to be snakes?
3506	3509	Asps.
3509	3511	Very dangerous.
3512	3513	You go first.
3531	3533	If you're tryingto escape on foot,
3533	3536	the desert is three weeksin every direction,
3537	3538	so please, eat something.
3545	3547	I must apologizefor their treatment of you.
3547	3548	Yeah. Whose idea was it?
3548	3549	No food, no water.
3549	3551	What kind of peopleare these friends of yours?
3552	3554	At this particular timeand place, to do my work,
3555	3556	they are necessary evils.
3556	3558	They're not my friends.
3558	3560	However, with theright connections,
3560	3562	even in this part of the world,
3562	3565	we are not entirely uncivilized.
3566	3568	It's beautiful.
3568	3571	I would very much liketo see you in it.
3573	3575	I'll bet you would.
3579	3580	All right.
3588	3590	What do you got to drinkaround here?
3593	3595	We don't have much time.
3595	3597	Soon they will come to harm you,
3597	3599	and I will not be ableto stop them,
3599	3601	unless you are ableto give me something
3601	3603	to placate them.
3603	3606	Some, uh, pieceof information...
3606	3609	which I can useto protect you from them.
3609	3611	I've already told youeverything I know.
3611	3613	I have no loyalty to Jones.
3614	3616	He's brought menothing but trouble.
3622	3624	Marion, you are beautiful.
3629	3632	I don't thinkwe need a chaperone.
3635	3636	Steadily.
3636	3638	Steadily. Whoa!
3640	3641	Down...
3642	3643	Down... Whoa.
3643	3644	Carefully, carefully!
3644	3646	You all right, Indy?
3649	3653	Now gently, boys.Gently, gently!
3661	3662	Whoa...
3671	3673	I told you it will be all right.
3689	3690	Huh...
3698	3700	Sallah, get down here!
3718	3720	You pour.
3829	3831	Oh, that's good.
3834	3835	Whoops.
3841	3843	What is this stuff, Rene?
3844	3846	I grew up with this.
3847	3849	It's my family label.
3877	3880	Well... I have to begoing now, Rene.
3882	3885	I like you, Rene, very much.
3885	3888	Perhaps we'll meet somedayunder better circumstances.
3892	3894	We meet again, Fraulein.
3896	3898	You Americans,you're all the same.
3900	3903	Always overdressingfor the wrong occasions.
3932	3934	Now...
3937	3939	what shall we talk about?
4014	4016	All right... take it up!
4017	4019	Easy!
4020	4022	You're as stubborn as that girl.
4022	4024	You like her too much, I think.
4024	4029	Your methods of archaeologyare too primitive for me.
4029	4033	You would use a bulldozerto find a... China cup.
4037	4039	Shliemann! Wake your men!
4039	4041	Indy, the torchesare burning out.
4041	4043	Go on, get out of here.
4043	4045	Hyah!
4062	4063	Sallah!
4063	4064	Hello!
4065	4066	Hello!
4066	4068	Why, Dr. Jones,whatever are you doing
4069	4071	in such a nasty place?
4071	4073	Why don't you come on down here!I'll show you!
4073	4074	Thank you, my friend,
4074	4076	but I think we are allvery comfortable up here.
4076	4078	That's right, isn't it?
4079	4081	Yes, we are very comfortableup here.
4082	4084	So, once again, Jones,
4084	4087	what was briefly yoursis now mine.
4087	4090	What a fitting endto your life's pursuits.
4090	4092	You're about to becomea permanent addition
4092	4094	to this archaeological find.
4094	4095	Who knows?
4095	4097	In a thousand years,even you may be worth something.
4099	4101	Son of a bitch.
4101	4103	I'm afraid we must begoing now, Dr. Jones.
4103	4105	Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
4105	4107	But I do not wish to leave you
4107	4109	down in that awful placeall alone.
4110	4111	Slimy pig, you let me go!
4111	4112	Stop it!
4115	4116	Marion!
4117	4118	Hang on.
4119	4120	Don't...
4120	4121	- Indy!- Don't fall!
4121	4124	Marion, I got you!I got you! I got you!
4127	4129	You traitor!You get your hands off of me!
4137	4138	Snakes!
4140	4141	Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!
4143	4144	The girl was mine!
4144	4145	She's of no use to us.
4145	4147	Only our missionfor the fuehrer matters.
4149	4151	I wonder sometimes, Monsieur,
4151	4153	if you have thatclearly in mind.
4153	4155	It was not to be, cherie.
4155	4158	You bastards!I'll get you for this!
4158	4161	Indiana Jones...
4161	4162	adieu.
4174	4176	No!
4185	4186	Take this.
4186	4187	Wave it at anythingthat slithers.
4188	4189	Thank you.
4189	4191	Oh, my God, this wholeplace is slithering.
4194	4195	Indy!
4195	4198	Ow! Jesus!
4199	4202	Where did you get this?From him?
4202	4203	I was trying to escape.
4203	4204	No thanks to you.
4204	4206	How hard were you trying?
4206	4207	Well, where the hell were you?
4207	4208	Watch it, watch it.
4208	4209	What are you doing?!
4210	4211	For the fire!
4213	4215	How the hell are we goingto get out of here?
4215	4216	I'm working on it!I'm working on it!
4216	4218	Well, whatever you'redoing, do it faster.
4222	4223	Ah...
4223	4225	Where are you going?
4225	4226	Through that wall.
4227	4229	Just get ready to run,whatever happens to me.
4229	4230	What do you mean by that?
4241	4244	Indy!
4244	4247	Damn it! Don't you leave medown here by myself!
4270	4272	Indy!
4272	4273	Here we go!
4273	4274	Get ready!
4274	4278	Indy, the torch is going out!
4317	4319	Indy?
4338	4340	Marion!
4340	4342	Look. Look.
4379	4380	They're going to fly itout of here.
4381	4382	When that Ark gets loaded,
4382	4384	we're already goingto be on the plane.
4389	4392	Ah, monsieur, let us toastour success in the desert.
4392	4394	To the Ark.
4394	4395	When we are very farfrom here.
4396	4397	That will do.
4447	4451	Hey, you now... come here!
4452	4453	Come here!
4516	4517	Indy!
4566	4568	Stay with the Ark!Stay with the Ark!
4573	4574	Look out!

5139	5141	Idiot! Idiot!
5184	5186	Everything at lasthas been arranged.
5186	5187	The Ark?
5187	5188	Is on board.
5188	5190	Nothing is lacking,now that you're here.
5190	5191	Or what is left of you.
5191	5192	You trust these guys?
5192	5194	Yes.
5194	5196	Mr. Katanga.
5200	5202	Mr. Katanga,these are my friends.
5202	5204	They are my family.
5204	5207	I will hear of itif they are not treated well.
5207	5210	My cabin is theirs.
5210	5211	Mr. Jones...
5212	5214	I've heard a lot about you, sir.
5214	5217	Your appearance is exactlythe way I imagined.
5222	5224	Good-bye.
5225	5227	Look out for each other.
5227	5229	I am already missing you.
5232	5234	You're my good friend.
5235	5237	Sallah.
5240	5243	That is for Fayah...
5243	5246	that is for your children...
5246	5248	and this is for you.
5253	5254	Thank you.
5262	5267	A British tar is a soaring soul
5267	5271	As free as a mountain bird
5272	5275	His energetic fistshould be ready to...
5277	5279	...a dictator...
5286	5287	Where did you go?
5287	5288	I'm cleaning up.
5290	5292	Where'd you get that?
5292	5293	From him.
5293	5295	Who him?
5295	5295	Katanga.
5296	5297	I got a feelingI'm not the first woman
5298	5299	ever to travelwith these pirates.
5299	5301	It's lovely.
5301	5302	Yeah?
5302	5303	Yeah.
5303	5304	Really?
5304	5306	Yeah.
5317	5318	What'd you say?
5325	5327	Wait... I don't need any help.
5327	5329	You know you do.
5331	5334	You're not the manI knew ten years ago.
5334	5338	It's not the years, honey,it's the mileage.
5342	5343	You are...
5345	5346	Please, I don't need a nurse.
5346	5348	- I just want to sleep.- Don't be such a baby.
5348	5349	Marion, leave me alone.
5349	5350	- What is this here?- Go away.
5350	5352	Yes, it hurts.
5352	5354	Ow!
5354	5356	Well, goddamn it, Indy,where doesn't it hurt?
5357	5359	Here.
5364	5366	Here.
5374	5376	This isn't too bad.
5385	5386	Here.
5406	5407	Jones...
5410	5412	Jones?!
5414	5418	We never seem to geta break, do we?
5443	5444	What is it?
5444	5445	Engines have stopped.
5446	5447	I'm going to go check.
5457	5458	What's happening?
5458	5459	We have most important friends.
5460	5461	Holy shit.
5463	5463	I sent my man for you.
5464	5465	You and the girl must disappear.
5465	5466	We have a place in the hold.
5466	5466	Come on, go, go, go.
5466	5467	Come on, go, my friend, go.
5480	5482	Where is Dr. Jones?
5482	5483	What's the big idea?
5483	5484	Let go!
5488	5491	Don't you touch me.
5533	5535	What about Jones?
5535	5537	There's no trace yet, sir.
5537	5539	Jones is dead.
5540	5542	I killed him.
5543	5544	He was of no use to us.
5545	5549	This girl, however, has certainvalue where we're headed.
5549	5552	She'll bring a very good price.
5552	5553	Mmm?
5553	5556	Herr Colonel,that cargo you've taken...
5556	5558	if it's your goal,go in peace with it,
5558	5559	but leave us the girl.
5559	5561	It would reduce our losson this trip.
5561	5563	Savage!
5563	5566	You are not in the positionto ask for anything.
5567	5568	We will take what we wish.
5568	5570	And then decide whether or not
5570	5572	to blow your shipfrom the water.
5575	5576	The girl goes with me.
5576	5579	She'll be partof my compensation.
5579	5581	I'm sure your fuehrerwould approve.
5581	5583	If she fails to please me,
5583	5585	you may do with her as you wish.
5585	5587	I will wasteno more time with her now.
5588	5589	Excuse me.
5604	5606	I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.
5606	5607	I've looked everywhere.
5607	5610	He's got to be here somewhere.
5610	5611	Look again.
5613	5614	- I found him.- Where?
5615	5615	There.
5756	5758	The altar has beenprepared in accordance
5758	5760	with your radio instructions,sir.
5760	5761	Good.
5761	5762	Take the Ark there immediately.
5764	5765	Monsieur...
5768	5770	I am uncomfortablewith the thought
5770	5772	of this... Jewish ritual.
5774	5776	Are you sure it's necessary?
5776	5778	Let me ask you this:
5778	5782	Would you be more comfortableopening the Ark in Berlin,
5782	5784	for your fuehrer?
5784	5785	Finding out, only then,
5785	5788	if the sacred piecesof the Covenant are inside?
5788	5789	Knowing, only then,
5789	5791	whether you have accomplishedyour mission,
5791	5794	and obtained the one true Ark?
5879	5880	Hello!
5883	5884	Jones.
5885	5886	Jones!
5887	5889	I'm going to blow up the Ark,Rene.
5894	5898	Your persistencesurprises even me.
5898	5900	You're going to givemercenaries a bad name.
5901	5903	Dr. Jones...
5906	5908	surely you don't think you canescape from this island.
5908	5911	That depends on how reasonablewe're all willing to be.
5911	5913	All I want is the girl.
5917	5919	If we refuse?
5919	5922	Then your fuehrer has no prize.
5923	5924	Okay, stand back.
5924	5925	All of you, stand back.
5925	5927	Stand back.
5927	5928	Okay, Jones.
5928	5931	You win!
5931	5932	Blow it up.
5938	5939	Yes, blow it up!
5941	5943	Blow it back to God.
5943	5945	All your life has been spent
5945	5948	in pursuitof archaeological relics.
5948	5952	Inside the Ark are treasuresbeyond your wildest aspirations.
5952	5956	You want to see it openas well as I.
5956	5958	Indiana...
5959	5962	we are simply passingthrough history.
5963	5964	This...
5966	5968	This is history.
5977	5979	Do as you will.
6128	6130	Marion, don't look at it.
6130	6131	Shut your eyes, Marion.
6131	6133	Don't look at it,no matter what happens.
6144	6146	Ah...
6160	6162	It's beautiful!
6172	6173	Indy?
6173	6174	Don't look, Marion!
6175	6176	Keep your eyes shut!
6251	6252	Marion.
6283	6286	You've done your country agreat service, and we thank you
6286	6290	and we trust you foundthe settlement satisfactory.
6290	6291	Oh, the money's fine.
6292	6293	The situation'stotally unacceptable.
6293	6294	Well, gentlemen,
6294	6296	I guess that just aboutwraps it up.
6296	6298	Where is the Ark?
6298	6301	I thought we'd settled that.
6301	6303	The Ark is somewhere very safe.
6303	6304	From whom?
6304	6307	The Ark is a sourceof unspeakable power
6307	6309	and it has to be researched.
6309	6312	And it will be,I assure you, Dr. Brody,
6312	6313	Dr. Jones.
6314	6317	We have top menworking on it right now.
6318	6319	Who?
6321	6323	Top men.
6326	6329	Hey, what happened?
6329	6330	You don't look very happy.
6330	6332	Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
6332	6333	What'd they say?
6333	6336	They don't knowwhat they've got there.
6336	6339	Well, I know what I've got here.
6339	6340	Come on.
6340	6342	I'll buy you a drink.
6344	6345	You know...
6345	6347	a drink?
