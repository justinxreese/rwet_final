142	143	Send him back.
156	158	Will you commit to this program?
160	161	I can't.
172	174	Will you commit to this program?
183	185	Will you commit to this program?
187	189	I can't.
253	255	There's no placeit won't catch up to you.
255	257	It's how every story ends.
257	261	It's what you are, Jason, a killer.
261	263	You always will be.
263	266	Go ahead, go on, go on!Do it! Do it!
269	273	She wouldn't want me to,that's the only reason you're alive.
273	275	Who is "she"?
275	278	Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.
278	279	She was killed in India.
280	282	The director of operationsWard Abbott arranged it.
286	290	So we have a dirty section chiefwho kills Bourne's girl.
290	295	Bourne comes back for revenge, tapes Abbott'sconfession, and Abbott commits suicide...
295	300	Now Bourne's gunnin' for us.You couldn't make this stuff up.
302	306	Bourne's last confirmed locationwas Moscow, six weeks ago.
307	309	- Right.- He's on the run, he's dangerous...
309	312	Now, Sir, with respect, I think,something else could be going on here.
312	314	What... what's he after?
315	318	The reason that Bourne went to Moscowwas to see the daughter of his first target.
318	319	What's your point Pam?
319	321	Maybe he was retracing his steps.
321	324	Just looking for something...something in his past.
325	328	Maybe he hasn't found it yet.We need to know, what it is.
328	331	You're telling me, he's not athreat to this agency?
331	333	I think if he wanted to hurt us he could have sent the tape to CNN...
334	335	Maybe he still will.
337	341	My number one rule is "hope for the best, plan for the worst. "
343	348	As far as I'm concerned, Bourne's stilla serious threat, until proven otherwise.
349	351	- Let's keep looking!- Yes, Sir.
394	396	This one's from three years ago.
396	398	He had half of INTERPOL after him.
398	403	He turned up in Naples, Berlin,Moscow, disappeared again.
405	407	Girl that he was on the run with.
407	409	Marie Kreutz.
409	412	She was found dead in a river,halfway round the world.
412	414	She'd been shot in the head.
416	418	What connects the dots?
430	431	Turn off the tape recorder.
480	482	Where is my sister?
487	488	Why don't you sit down?
500	501	Where is she?
506	507	She's dead.
510	511	She was killed.
514	515	I'm sorry.
526	528	I knew this can end this way.
533	535	- It was always gonna end this way.- I didn't believe that.
544	546	And how did she die?
550	551	She was shot.
554	556	We were together inIndia.
559	560	He came for me.
564	565	You killed him?
568	569	Yes.
571	572	And now what?
575	579	Someone started all of this.And I'm gonna find him.
591	591	Hey, It's me.
592	595	Yeah.He knows the whole story.
597	598	Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.
598	600	Have you heard aboutOperation Blackbriar?
602	605	I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.I'll see you first thing. Ok.
621	625	I have a hit on Echelon - Blackbriar.I repeat, Blackbriar.
626	629	Looks like it's coming from a European signal.
629	631	NSA please confirm, your receipt.

673	675	Now, who talked to him?How did he find about Blackbriar?
676	679	I don't know, we've pulled his background andwe've run a crosscheck on known anomalies...
679	682	We come up with nothing, but I thinkif we follow Ross we're going to be able...
682	686	Ross is easy,we want the source.
702	704	Have you heard aboutOperation Blackbriar?
704	705	Do you have details?

1531	1535	Pull all of agents back. Give Bourne's location at the back of the store to the asset.
1535	1537	Yes, sir.

1562	1564	- Bourne.- Wait, something's not right.
1564	1569	I can see the entrancefrom here. If I go now I can make it.
1572	1574	- Bourne.- Just stay where you are.
1574	1576	I don't think we should wait.
1578	1580	I think somebody is coming.
1580	1582	- I am going for it.- No, not.
1685	1688	We have a situation...
1694	1696	- Yes?- Director Kramer would like to see you.
1696	1700	- You need to get those warrants...- He said it's urgent.
1757	1762	What the police will tell me is that they believethat the victim is 35 year old Simon Ross,
1763	1767	a well known journalist basedhere in London, with Guardian newspaper.
1767	1771	It appears that her was gunned down right in the middle of Waterloo Station, of course, 
1771	1772	around the 15:45 this afternoon,
1772	1774	in full view of hundredsof commuters...
1813	1815	- Good morning. Can I take your order?- Yes. I'll have...
1815	1819	the heart healthy omelet with goat's cheese and peppers, please.
1819	1821	- Anything for you, ma'am?- Only coffee, please.
1821	1824	- Sure? I'm buying.- I'm good.
1826	1829	So, when the director calledand it was suggested that we bring you...
1830	1833	Suggested? Are you sureit was just a suggestion?
1839	1845	It's funny how different things look, depending on where you sit, right?
1845	1848	I look at this as afavour for you, Pam.
1848	1851	I am giving you an opportunityto complete some unfinished business.
1851	1854	- Meaning...?- Bourne.
1854	1858	He's here. He's athreat. And we both want the same thing.
1858	1863	- And we both go about it in two very different ways.- Past is passed, Pam.
1865	1868	- You were careless in Stockholm.- So what was Waterloo? Just careless again?
1868	1871	We had a leak. A serious national security situation.
1871	1874	Bourne showed up on our surveillanceand we had very little time to react.
1874	1876	And a reportergot killed.
1876	1879	Bourne saw us coming. The questionit is: what was he doing there?
1879	1884	No, the real question is: how you managed toget into a fire-fight at a public train station?
1884	1887	You know, as well as I do, decisionsmade in realtime are never perfect.
1887	1892	Don't second guess anoperation from an armchair.
1894	1899	I'll see you at the office. Enjoy your egg whites.
1919	1920	People!
1921	1924	Pamela Landy and herassociate, Tom Cronin.
1924	1928	She's going to be quarter-backing the search effort. Say your name and state your specs please.
1928	1930	Well let's do names later, ok?
1930	1932	What's Bourne's last fixed postion?
1932	1934	London, 12:00 noon.
1934	1936	Status: What is he,armed, wounded?
1936	1938	Alive, mobile andunknown.
1939	1940	- Do you have an Echelon package?- Yes.
1940	1941	Why isn't it on?
1941	1944	- We were waiting.- Waiting for what?
1944	1947	Listen. People, do youhave any idea who you are dealing with?
1948	1949	This is Jason Bourne.
1949	1952	You are 9 hours behind the toughest target have ever tracked.
1953	1956	I want everyone to sit down,strap in and turn on all you've got.
1957	1961	That would mean now!Thank you!
1961	1963	Give me a team deployment plan.
1963	1966	I want everything you've got on Ross on Screen 1.
1988	1990	Sir, I think we have something.
1990	1993	We just hacked Ross's e-mail account at the Guardian.
1993	1997	We found a round-trip ticket to Turin, Italy, yesterday08:00 arrival, 12:05 departure.
1998	2001	I think can be pretty certain thatBourne is not your source, then.
2001	2002	How?
2002	2005	Ross's call to his editor, where he said he'd just met the source...
2005	2008	took place just after his Turin flight landed.
2008	2009	He met his source in Turin
2010	2011	- So?- So what,
2011	2013	Bourne met Ross inTurin for the breakfast,
2013	2015	then, the sameday, Bourne calls Ross...
2015	2016	to demand him meet at Waterloo?
2016	2019	Maybe they were even on the same flight.
2019	2024	Cross-check the secure cellphone usage of everyone with SCI clearance.
2024	2027	Yes, all calls going in and out of Turin, Italy, the morning that Ross was there.
2027	2030	The guy you're after is aCIA operative, with clearance above top secret,
2030	2033	he's committing treason by talking to Ross.
2033	2036	Do you really think while doing that he's going to use a cellphone that he knows we can track?
2036	2039	- Zero results on the cross check.- So you got any better ideas?
2040	2042	Yeah, look at all the people whose cellphones were switched off...
2042	2044	the entire period Rosswas in Turin.
2044	2048	I mean if your people are on their phones as much as mine, the list should be pretty small.
2052	2056	Three names: Tom Brewster,Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.
2057	2059	Now check everything in Ross's apartmentagainst those names.
2059	2063	Check for common patterns. Anything that indicates who Ross met.
2064	2067	Pull it up. Is that documents?
2070	2072	Over here. Who's that?
2073	2075	Right there. Initials.
2075	2076	Hold that. Bring that up on main.
2081	2086	Neil Daniels. He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?
2090	2093	Call the RSO at the embassy and take Daniels...
2093	2096	into custody if he is there. Anna,get Grab Teams for...
2096	2097	Calle Norte safe house.
2097	2100	Send them in heavy. Tell them we'll assist with the entry.
2100	2103	- Heavy? Daniels is not it...- I am worried about Bourne.
2103	2108	If he is not the source, then he is after the source. The same as we are.
2142	2145	- ETA team 2?- Three minutes to the destination, sir.
2169	2173	Your mission will saveAmerican lives.
2177	2181	Will you give yourself to this program.
2181	2183	I can't.
2183	2184	Again.
2222	2225	Sir, they're at the front door.
2243	2245	- Five seconds.- Bring it up live.
2254	2254	We're in.
2259	2259	The alarm is down.
2261	2263	That's gotta be Bourne.
2275	2278	- The safe is empty.- Shit!
2278	2279	Looks like he left in a hurry.
2279	2282	Track Daniels'spassports.
2340	2343	Damn it. Get a backup team in there.
2353	2356	Get me a secure line. Get the second team over there now.
2366	2369	What are you doing here?
2369	2374	I was posted here after Berlin.
2375	2378	Where's Daniels?
2379	2382	Where is he?
2405	2406	Hello?
2406	2407	Who is this?
2407	2411	This is Nicky Parsons.
2412	2413	She was Treadstone, logistics.
2413	2416	She was with us whenwe hunted Bourne in Berlin.
2421	2426	Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge. Code-in: Sparrow.
2436	2439	Response: Everest.
2442	2445	Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.How long have you been on site?
2446	2448	I just walked in.
2448	2454	We have two officers on site.Are you in contact with them?
2455	2460	They are down. Unconscious,but alive.
2463	2466	- Any sign of Neal Daniels?- No.
2467	2471	Nicky this isPam Landy.
2471	2475	We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.
2476	2480	Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?I thought that case was closed.
2480	2483	No. Some people are convinced he's still a threat.
2483	2485	I disagree, but to find outI need to talk to him.
2485	2487	Hold on, Nicky.
2488	2491	- What the hell are you doing?- Trying to send him a message.
2491	2493	You don't think Bourne is a threat? He just took out two more of my men.
2493	2496	The only way this has a happy ending Noah is if we bring him in alive.
2496	2497	He is going after Daniels.
2499	2502	He wants revenge Pam and the only realistic way to end this is to eliminate the threat.
2502	2504	How long until backup?
2505	2508	Nicky, I need that youto stay put and secure the premises.
2508	2512	Backup will be arriving in approximatelyone hour, do you copy?
2515	2517	Copy, sir.
2521	2523	- How long do I have?- Three minutes.
2526	2531	My car is outside.I know where Daniels is.
2541	2543	Operator, whereis the emergency?
2550	2551	Come on.
2553	2554	2 minutes to destination, sir.
2556	2558	- Where was Daniels headed?- At 8:00 this morning...
2558	2561	He wired US $100,000to a bank account in Tangier.
2562	2566	That's 300 miles away. If we hurry we can make the morning ferry.
2567	2570	- Where are you parked?- To the right. About 20 meters.
2570	2571	Near side of the street.
2577	2579	- They are coming.- Keep moving.
2580	2584	Two subjects seen exiting safe house.
2595	2598	What the hell is this?
2606	2607	- Understood.- What the hell just happened?
2607	2610	- We've lost visual contact with the subjects, sir.- Christ!
2613	2617	Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.
2618	2620	Send a system wide alert to all Spanish contacts.
2620	2625	I want all air and ground border exits shut down.
2646	2649	What's going on?
2650	2653	What has Daniels got?
2654	2657	What is operationBlackbriar?
2658	2662	You want to tell me or should I call Kramer and ask him?
2665	2668	- For Christ's sake Pam, are in the middle of an operation.- Bullshit.
2670	2675	You want JasonBourne? Level with me.
2682	2686	Operation Blackbriar started as an NEAT surveillance program.
2686	2687	What is now?
2687	2689	It is now the umbrella program for all our Black ops.
2690	2693	Full envelope intrusion, rendition, experimental interrogation.
2693	2697	It is all run out of this office.
2697	2702	We are the sharp end of thestick now, Pam.
2702	2704	Lethal action?
2704	2707	If we have to, sure.
2708	2712	That's what makes us special No more red tape.
2712	2714	No more getting the bad guys caught on our sites, then watching them escape...
2714	2718	while we wait for somebodyin Washington to issue the order.
2719	2720	Oh, come on!
2723	2725	You saw the raw intel, Pam. You know how real the danger is.
2725	2728	We need theseprograms, now.
2728	2730	What's the connectionto Daniels?
2731	2734	He ran all of our operationsin Southern Europe and North Africa.
2734	2736	So he has everything.
2736	2741	Names, dates, ghost sites, who's cooperating with us abroad - every operation.
2741	2744	Do you want that stuff in Bourne's hands?Out on the market to the highest bidder?
2744	2747	I don't think so.
2748	2752	Bourne's not after money. He's after Daniels for a reason.
2752	2755	Well, what does it matter what Bourne is after?
2755	2759	When we find Daniels, andbelieve me, we'll find him,
2759	2764	if you're right,we get Bourne too.
2791	2794	Why did you come back?
2796	2799	Why are you looking for Daniels?
2808	2811	Do you know who that is?
2811	2813	That's Daniels.
2815	2817	I don't know who that is. Who is he?
2823	2826	He was there at the beginning.
2826	2829	I remember meeting him.
2830	2835	The first day. Danielsbrought me to him.
2837	2840	That's where it all started for me.
2840	2845	Something happened with me.I need to know what it was.
2846	2849	Or I will never befree of this.
2849	2854	Daniels said thetraining was experimental.
2854	2858	Behaviour modification.
2858	2863	They had to break down the agents before they became operational.
2863	2867	He said you were the first one.
2869	2872	Why you helping me?
2881	2886	It was difficult forme... with you.
2902	2906	You really don't remember anything?
2907	2910	No.
2918	2921	We have to move.
2929	2934	Sir, Mr. Wills. You're gonna want to look at this.
2943	2946	He is in Tangier.
2952	2955	Noah Vosen.
2964	2967	We have found Daniels.
2970	2973	They just tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier,
2973	2975	they are holding up a bank transfermade keep him in place...
2975	2977	while they bring anasset up from Casablanca.
2977	2980	They're going to take him out?
2988	2992	- Yes?- It is Pam Landy, she says it's urgent.
2992	2995	- Tell her I'm unavailable.- Yes, sir.
3050	3055	Sir, assethas arrived at the airport.
3075	3077	Give me the subject's location.
3078	3082	Subject is now on foot andentering Hotel Velásquez.
3082	3084	Hotel is the2.2km from the bank.
3085	3087	I want an elevation and a floorplan tic-tac-toe.
3087	3089	Locate the room.
3089	3094	Give the asset subject location and the route between the subject's hotel and the bank.
3109	3111	- Do we have that room yet?- Yes, sir. Room 117.
3112	3115	Get a hold of the hotel trunk line.
3115	3119	Run all calls through here with an iso. on on room 117.
3133	3135	His location's being blocked the firewall.
3135	3138	No, they found Daniels,they know where he is.
3138	3141	- They will order one of the operatives to terminate him.- Find out who.
3145	3147	Desh.
3148	3151	Tell him you're going to meet him and you have a new phone for him.
3151	3154	If you stop Desh,they will just get someone else
3154	3155	We're not going to stop him, we're going to follow him.
3155	3157	He'll take us right to Daniels.
3195	3199	Sir, the asset is deviating off course.
3200	3203	Let it play.
3234	3237	Asset unscheduled stop.
3267	3269	Sir, asset is on the move. En route to subject.
3269	3272	Sir, we have an unauthorized breech.
3272	3275	Someone with active system knowledge penetrated in our protocol.
3275	3279	Instructions were sent to theasset at 14:11 local time.
3279	3284	The trace is confirmed and valid. I came from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons.
3288	3290	Where did the course deviation occur?
3290	3293	South to Rue de Belgique. Stationary Place de France.
3294	3296	That's where Parsons is.
3296	3298	When we're finished with Daniels, send the asset after her.
3298	3299	Yes, sir.
3299	3302	If we find Parsons, we find Bourne.
3302	3304	Noah, what are you doing?
3304	3306	- Not now.- I want to know that is going on.
3306	3307	I said not now.
3307	3309	What basis are you continuing this operation on?
3309	3312	On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation,
3312	3313	she is up to her neck in this.
3313	3316	- This is about Daniels, not Nicky.- She betrayed us.
3316	3320	- You don't know the circumstances, Noah.- She is in league with Jason Bourne for Christ sake!
3320	3323	You do not have the authority to kill her.
3323	3326	Oh yes I do. And you had better get on board.
3326	3328	Noah, she's one of us.
3328	3331	You start down this path, where does it end?
3331	3334	It ends when we've won.
3347	3350	When we're finished withDaniels, send the asset after them.
3350	3352	Yes, sir.
3373	3379	- Two minutes, sir.- Tell to the bank to release the funds.
3393	3394	Hello?
3394	3398	Mr. Daniels, themoney is available.
3403	3405	He's on the move.
3443	3445	- We are ready to fall in.- 200 meters.
3445	3448	Ok, come on, I want the latest preliminary tracking.
3456	3458	Stop!
4160	4163	Go do it. We needto be dead.
4170	4174	Sir, asset confirms both targets are dead.
4184	4185	I want to be sure about this.
4186	4189	Ask the station chief from Rabat to confirm the deaths...
4189	4189	and do a Sub Rosa collection of the bodies.
4190	4191	I want to tie this thing off completely.
4192	4195	And keep an eye on Landy.
4204	4207	- Hello?- Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.
4207	4208	Are you sure of that?
4208	4211	Our station chiefin Rabat is confirming.
4213	4216	I cannot afford to have this come back to me.
4216	4219	Don't worry,you are protected.
4219	4223	Just remember why we put Landy there.
4223	4228	If Blackbriar goes south, we'll roll it up and hang it around her neck and start over.
4295	4298	I can seetheir faces.
4303	4307	Of everyone I ever killed.
4308	4312	I just don't know theirnames.
4326	4329	Marie used to try that.
4330	4333	And alone I remember the names.
4345	4348	I've tried to apologise...
4348	4351	for what I've done...
4354	4356	for what I am...
4358	4363	but nothing makes it any better.
4376	4380	They're gonna come for you again.
4384	4387	You're gonna have to run now.
4470	4472	We should go.
4501	4504	It gets easier.
4519	4523	Those are the belongingsof Sr. Daniels.
4523	4527	- That is everything.- Yes.
4527	4529	Let to see me that.
4565	4567	The station chiefin Rabat just called.
4567	4569	They found a body.
4571	4574	- Bourne?- Desh.
4580	4583	Pam, you need to see this.
4590	4593	A passport for Gilberto dePiento just cleared immigration.
4593	4596	It is early Treadstone identity registered to Jason Bourne.
4596	4599	But he never used itand it never went to the grid.
4599	4602	Bourne's alive.
4609	4610	They don't know?
4610	4613	If they knew, Voson wouldn't bein this office right now.
4613	4615	It's a hell of a risk.
4616	4618	Maybe Bourne wantsus to know.
4618	4620	Just like Naples.
4620	4622	Maybe he's communicating...
4623	4625	Maybe he's tryingto communicate with you.
4625	4628	Then we should communicate back.
4628	4632	I think I know what Bourne is looking for.
4639	4644	Gilberto Del Piento. Gilberto Del Piento.Your party is waiting for you.
4736	4737	Pamela Landy.
4738	4741	I hear that you'restill looking for me.
4743	4744	Bourne?
4744	4747	What do you want?
4749	4753	- Yes?- Better get in here, we've got a situation.
4756	4760	I wantedto thank you for the tape.
4760	4763	It's all tied off, it's over.
4764	4767	I thinkI owe you an apology.
4767	4769	Is that official?
4769	4771	No, off the record. You know how it is.
4772	4774	- Tracing this?- 50 seconds trace.
4774	4777	- Good-bye.- Wait, wait!
4779	4783	David Webb. That's your real name.
4784	4788	You were born the 04/15/71 in Nixon, Missouri.
4788	4792	Why don't you come in and we'll talk about it.
4792	4795	Something is very wrong here.
4797	4799	Bourne?
4800	4801	Get some rest, Pam.
4801	4803	You look tired.
4805	4808	He is lookingright at her.
4810	4812	People, listen up!
4812	4815	This is a national security emergency. We have an imminent threat.
4816	4817	I'm going out there.
4817	4820	I will show myself,he'll find me.
4820	4821	Jason Bourne is alive.
4821	4825	And is at large in New York city, and we believed within 1,000 yards of this building.
4825	4827	I want an immediate 12 block lockdown of the area.
4827	4832	Send a flash message to Langley, prep for local backup assistance.
4834	4836	Landy just left the building.
4836	4839	Stay with her telephone.
4854	4858	She is using her cell.It's an incoming text.
4858	4860	- Get it. How many do we have on Landy?- 6 men and more on the way.
4861	4865	I've got, sir, coming up on the screen now.
4868	4871	Anyone not on Landy goes directly to Tudor City.
4871	4875	Get the vehicles, we're going mobile.
4919	4922	There's only one way out of there. Whywould he do that? He's trapping himself.
4922	4924	Bad place to meet. It's too exposed.
4925	4928	He would not have chosen it, if he didn't have a reason.
4932	4934	Subject is en route.
4934	4938	- Rear 4-3, let me know when you have a visual.- Rear 4-3 standing by.
4945	4948	- Standing by.- Ok folks, here we go.
4948	4950	Fox, 200 meters.
4950	4952	- Visual on leader?- Point 3 ground in position.
4954	4957	As soon as you have eyes onLandy, I want to know.
4971	4975	- Here we go.- Copy that, I see her.
4986	4990	- Any sign of Bourne?- Negative.
4990	4993	No sign of target.
5003	5005	Noah Vosen.
5006	5008	This is Jason Bourne.
5009	5011	I was wondering when you were going to make this call.
5011	5013	How do you get this number?
5013	5019	You didn't actually think I was coming to Tudor City, did you?
5019	5020	No, I guess not.
5020	5025	But if it's me you want to talk to, perhaps we can arrange a meet.
5025	5027	Where are you now?
5028	5031	I sitting in my office.
5031	5033	I doubt that.
5033	5035	Why would you doubt that?
5035	5040	If you were in your office right now,we'd be having this conversation face to face.
5047	5048	Noah Vosen.
5051	5053	This is a code 10 abort.
5053	5057	I want everyone back in the vehicles. This is a code 10 abort.
5057	5060	Move it!
5079	5080	Yeah?
5080	5083	Wills, checkmy office.
5087	5089	Damn.
5096	5098	 - He's got everything.- God damn it.
5098	5101	 Alright, set a four block perimeter around the building.
5101	5105	I want the entire building searched. Every room, every hallway, every closet,
5105	5109	every god damn air duct,do you understand? I want him found.
5112	5113	What just happened?
5113	5119	Bourne broke into CRI. He got into Vosen's safe.
5119	5123	- Where to?- 415 East 71st Street.
5123	5127	4-15-71? Jesus, Pam!
5152	5154	Target in sight.
5167	5168	He's headed east in the Port Authority.
5169	5173	All agents have shoot on sight authorization.
5239	5241	- Sir, he drove off the roof.- What?
5241	5243	He drove off the roof.
5244	5247	He's on foot, he's running.
5257	5259	Police, freeze!
5259	5262	Put your handsin the air!
5296	5299	Sir, sir, take a look at this. Bourne's birthday, sir.
5299	5301	- What about it?- Check that out!
5301	5305	Landy told Bourne that his birthdaywas 04/15/71.
5306	5308	13/09/70My god, it's a code.
5308	5311	Everything stops, Everything stops! Listen up!
5311	5315	04-15-71, new assignment.Numbers. What does it mean?
5315	5320	Sir, if you plug them in as variables of longitude and latitude you get... Cameroon.
5320	5324	41571 is a ZIP CODEfor Barny, Kentucky.
5326	5330	- What date did she give?- 04-15-71.
5330	5332	I don't believe it!
5332	5336	SRD isat 415 East 71st Street.
5336	5338	 She just gave him the training facility.
5338	5341	- Christ!- Bring all the teams in behind us.
5460	5463	Hurry up! Somebody call911.
5497	5500	The asset lost Bourne. We lost him.
5507	5510	- Hello?- Albert, it's Vosen.
5510	5512	Bourne knows everything.
5512	5515	 He's on his way to you right now.
5515	5517	He is cominghome, Noah.
5518	5519	 How longdo I have?
5519	5523	I don't know, justget the hell out of there.
5523	5525	No, I'm going to stay.
5525	5529	 He'll head for the training wing. That's what he knows.
5529	5531	I will keep him in play...
5532	5534	until you get there.
5583	5586	They'll kill you forgiving me this.
5586	5589	4-15-71 isn't much of a code.
5589	5592	My guess is Vosenis on his way already.
5592	5594	Why'd you do it?
5594	5597	Because this isn't what I signed up for.
5597	5599	What did toyou... Blackbriar...
5599	5601	This isn't us.
5603	5605	Then dosomething about it.
5605	5608	Everything that you need is in there.
5611	5613	Everything.
5614	5615	David.
5615	5617	Why don't you come in with me?
5617	5619	It will be better ifwe do this together.
5619	5620	No.
5622	5627	This is where it started forme... this is where it ends.
5640	5641	That's Landy.
5653	5658	Alright, lock this building down. Set a secure perimeter of one block.
5664	5667	Hello, here it is Pamela Landy, I havesend a classified document.

5701	5703	Go, go!
5708	5711	This one here. Where is this?
5711	5712	First floor.
5712	5714	I'll take Landy on my own.
5749	5753	You'd better yourself a good lawyer.
5778	5781	... we finish with you, youwill no longer be David Webb.
5784	5786	 He may not evenremember who he was.
5789	5792	 Do you know why we are treating you like this?
5794	5796	Hello, Jason.
5798	5801	I believe you'vebeen having problems.
5801	5804	Put the gun down.
5804	5809	I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk.
5810	5813	I've spent three years running.
5813	5815	Three years.
5815	5817	Trying to find outwho I am.
5817	5820	But still not got it all back have you?
5820	5823	Still not filled in the pieces.
