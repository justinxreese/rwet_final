100	102	Three of a kind, let's do this.That's it? Three guys?
103	106	Two guys on the roof. Every guy getsa share. Five shares is plenty.
106	108	Six shares. Don't forgetthe guy who planned the job.
108	111	He thinks he can sit it outand still take a slice.
111	114	-I know why they call him the Joker.So, why do they call him the Joker?
114	116	I heard he wears makeup.Makeup?
116	118	Yeah, to scare people.You know, war paint.
130	133	All right, everybody,hands up, heads down!
133	136	I said, hands up, heads down!
136	139	Let's go, pal,I'm making a withdrawal here.
139	141	-I said, hands up!-No!
141	143	Here comes the silent alarm.
143	145	And there it goes.
145	146	Heads down!
146	148	All right, tootsie,you're taking a dive with me.
148	151	-Down! I said, stay down there!Don't hurt me!
151	154	It's funny, it didn't dial out to 911.It was trying to reach a private number.
154	156	Is it a problem?No, I'm done here.
165	167	Sit down! Down!
168	170	Down! I said, stay down there!
174	177	Obviously we don't want youdoing anything with your hands...
177	180	...other than holding on for dear life.
187	189	On the ground! Stay on the ground!
189	193	Nobody make a move!Nobody! Stay down!
209	210	Yeah!
212	214	You have any ideawho you're stealing from?
214	218	-You and your friends are dead.He's out, right?
221	222	What--?
230	231	Where did you learn to count?
234	236	They wired this thing upwith like 5000 volts.
236	237	What kind of bank does that?
237	240	A Mob bank.I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.
241	242	Where's the alarm guy?
242	244	Boss told me when the guywas done, I should take him out.
244	246	One less share, right?
246	249	Funny, he told me something similar.
249	250	He what? No! No!
261	263	That's a lot of money.
263	266	If this Joker guy was so smart,he'd have us bring a bigger car.
268	272	I'm betting the Joker told you to kill mesoon as we loaded the cash.
272	276	No, no, no, no, I kill the bus driver.
277	278	Bus driver?
280	281	What bus driver?
285	287	School's out. Time to go.
287	289	Cat's not getting up, is he?
290	292	That's a lot of money.
295	297	What happened to the rest of the guys?
304	306	You think you're smart, huh?
307	308	The guy that hired youse...
309	311	...he'll just do the same to you.
312	315	Oh, criminals in this townused to believe in things.
315	316	Honor...
316	318	...respect.
318	320	Look at you.What do you believe in, huh?
320	322	What do you believe in?
322	327	I believe whatever doesn't kill yousimply makes you...
328	330	...stranger.
370	373	Mr. Mayor, you were electedin a campaign to clean up the city.
373	375	-When are you gonna start?Well, Mike, I believe I already have.
375	376	Like the so-called Batman.
376	379	We're hearing he's doing some good,the criminals are running scared. But I say...
379	382	-No, man. I don't like it tonight.-What are you, superstitious?
383	386	You got more chance of winningthe Power bowl than running into him.
386	389	That simply is not true.I'm told that our men in theMajor Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.
389	392	Hey, Wuertz, mayor saysyou're closing in on the Batman.
392	394	The investigation is ongoing.
394	397	The process of cleaning upthe streets is a long one.
397	399	I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have....
403	405	Ever intending to see your wife again,Lieutenant?
405	408	I thought you had togo look after your mother, Detective.
408	410	Checked her back into the hospital.
410	412	I'm sorry.
412	415	-So he hasn't shown up?-He often doesn't.
416	417	I like reminding everybodythat he's out there.
418	419	Why wouldn't he come?
419	421	Hopefully...
421	423	...because he's busy.
439	442	That's why we bring dogs.
442	444	-My little princes.Please.
444	448	Please, they're crawling in my mouth.Please, I beg you, get them off.
448	451	Look what your drugsdo to my customers.
451	452	Buyer beware!
452	455	I told you my compoundwould take you places.
456	458	I never said they'd be placesyou wanted to go.
458	461	My business, repeat customers.
461	463	You don't likewhat I have to offer...
463	465	...you can buy from someone else.
465	467	Assuming Batman left anyoneto buy from.
471	474	My dogs are hungry.
478	480	Pity there's only one of you.
488	489	What--?That's not him.
494	495	Loose the dogs!
507	509	That's more like it.
593	595	Don't let me find you out here again.
595	598	-We're trying to help you.I don't need help.
598	599	Not my diagnosis.
600	603	What gives you the right? What'sthe difference between you and me?
603	606	I'm not wearing hockey pads.
609	611	Everybody back now!
613	616	He can't resist showing us his face.
620	622	What's he hiding under that makeup?
630	632	Uh, can we get a minute,people, please?
635	637	Him again. Who are the others?
637	639	Another bunch of small timers.
640	642	Some of the marked bills I gave you.
642	644	My detectives have beenmaking drug buys with them for weeks.
644	647	This bank was another drop for the Mob.That makes five.
647	649	-We found the bulk of their dirty cash.-Time to move in.
649	653	We'd have to hit all bankssimultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
653	655	What about this Joker guy?
655	658	One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.
658	660	When the new DA hears about this,he'll want in.
661	663	-Do you trust him?-Be hard to keep him out.
663	666	I hear he's as stubborn as you are.
708	711	Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.
711	714	You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse...
714	715	...for not sleeping in a mansion.
716	719	Whenever you stitch yourself up,you do make a bloody mess.
719	722	Yeah. It makes me learnfrom my mistakes.
722	726	You ought to be pretty knowledgeableby now, then.
727	728	My armor.
729	732	I'm carrying too much weight.I need to be-- I need to be faster.
732	735	I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.
735	737	-Did you get mauled by a tiger?-It was a dog.
737	740	-Huh?-It was a big dog.
740	744	There were more copycats last night,Alfred, with guns.
744	746	Why don't you hire them andtake the weekend off?
746	749	That wasn't exactlywhat I had in mind...
749	750	...when I said I wantedto inspire people.
751	752	I know.
753	754	But things have improved.
754	757	Look at the new district attorney.
757	759	I am, closely.
759	761	Need to know if he can be trusted.
761	765	Are you interested in his characteror his social circle?
769	771	Who Rachel spends her time withis her business.
773	775	I trust you don't have me followedon my day off.
775	777	If you ever took one, I might.
779	781	Know your limits, Master Wayne.
781	784	Batman has no limits.
784	787	-Well, you do, sir.-Well, can't afford to know them.
787	790	And what's gonna happenon the day that you find out?
790	792	We all know how much you like to say"I told you so."
792	796	On that day, Master Wayne,even I won't want to.
796	797	Probably.
804	805	Sorry I'm late, folks.
809	811	-Where were you?-Worried you'd have to step up?
811	814	-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.-Well, then...
814	816	...fair's fair.
817	819	Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.
819	821	Yeah? You wannaflip a coin to see who leads?
821	824	It's my father's lucky coin. As I recall,it got me my first date with you.
824	827	I wouldn't leave something like thatup to chance.
828	831	I don't. I make my own luck.
832	836	All rise.The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.
836	839	I thought the DA just played golfwith the mayor or things like that.
839	842	Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough timeto put you away for life, Sally.
843	844	With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...
844	847	...someone must have stepped upto run the so-called family.
848	850	Is that man in this courtroom today?
852	855	-Could you identify him for us, please?-You win, counselor.
857	859	It was me.
860	864	I have a sworn statement from youthat this man...
864	868	...Salvatore Maroni, is the new headof the Falcone crime family.
868	872	Maroni? He's a fall guy.I'm the brains of the organization.
873	875	Order.-Permission to treat...
875	876	-...the witness as hostile?-Granted.
876	877	-Hostile? I'll show you hostile!
883	886	Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,made in China.
886	887	If you wanna kill apublic servant, Mr. Maroni...
888	890	...I recommend you buy American.
891	893	Get him out of here.-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.
897	900	We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni,so we won't be able to charge him.
900	903	But the fact that they're trying to kill you,means we're getting to them.
903	906	I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.I'm fine, by the way.
906	908	Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.
908	910	You're not getting shot at,you're not doing your job right.
911	912	But, you know...
912	915	...if you said you were rattled,we could take the rest of the day off.
915	918	Can't. I dragged the head ofthe Major Crimes Unit down here.
918	923	Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.Try to be nice.
931	934	I hear you got a hell of a right cross.
937	939	It's a shame Sal's going to walk.
940	943	Yeah, well, good thing about the Mobis they keep giving you second chances.
948	951	Lightly irradiated bills.
951	953	Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
954	955	We liaise with various agencies--
955	957	Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.
957	961	Official policy is to arrest the vigilanteknown as Batman on sight.
961	963	Mm-hm. What about that floodlighton the top of MCU?
963	965	If you got problemswith malfunctioning equipment...
966	969	...I suggest you take them upwith Maintenance, counselor.
969	971	I've put every money laundererin Gotham behind bars...
972	974	...but the Mobis still getting its money out.
974	977	I think you and your friendhave found the last game in town.
978	980	You're trying to hit themwhere it hurts, their wallets.
980	981	It's bold.
982	983	You gonna count me in?
984	987	In this town, the fewer people knowsomething, the safer the operation.
987	989	Gordon, I don't like that you gotyour own special unit...
990	992	...and i don't like that it's full of copsI investigated at Internal Affairs.
993	995	If I didn't work with cops you'd investigatedwhile you were making your name at IA...
995	997	...I'd be working alone.
997	999	I don't get political pointsfor being an idealist.
999	1002	I have to do the best I can with what I have.
1005	1009	You want me to back warrantsfor search and seizure on five banks...
1009	1011	...without telling me what we're after.
1012	1014	I can give you the names of the banks.
1014	1016	Well, that's a start.
1017	1019	I'll get you your warrants,but I want your trust.
1019	1021	Oh, you don't haveto sell me, Dent.
1021	1023	We all know you're Gotham'swhite knight.
1024	1027	Yeah, well, I heard they havea different name for me down at MCU.
1028	1029	I wouldn't know about that.
1030	1034	In China, Lau Security Investmentsstands for dynamic new growth.
1034	1038	A joint Chinese venture withWayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.
1038	1040	Well, Mr. Lau...
1040	1043	...I speak for the rest of the board...
1044	1046	...and Mr. Wayne,in expressing our own excitement.
1051	1055	Sir, I know that Mr. Wayne is curiousabout how his trust fund gets replenished...
1055	1057	...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.
1057	1060	You worry about the diligence,Mr. Reese.
1060	1062	I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
1062	1064	It's done.
1064	1066	The numbers are solid.
1066	1067	Do them again.
1067	1070	Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,now, would we?
1073	1074	Another long night?
1075	1077	This joint venture was your idea,and the consultants love it.
1078	1079	But I'm not convinced.
1079	1083	Lau's company has grown by8 percent annually like clockwork.
1083	1085	His revenue streammust be off the books...
1086	1087	...maybe even illegal.
1087	1089	Okay. Cancel the deal.
1090	1091	You already knew.
1092	1094	Just needed a closer look at their books.
1094	1096	Anything else you can trouble me for?
1097	1098	I need a new suit.
1098	1101	Yeah. Three buttonsis a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.
1101	1104	I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,so much as function.
1105	1107	You wanna be able to turn your head.
1107	1109	Sure make backing outof the driveway easier.
1109	1111	I'll see what I can do.
1115	1117	Took me three weeksto get a reservation here.
1117	1119	And I had to tell themI work for the government.
1120	1121	-Really?-The city Health inspector's...
1121	1122	...not afraid to pull strings.
1122	1124	Rachel. Fancy that.
1125	1127	Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.
1127	1129	Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.
1130	1135	-Natascha. Are you the prima--?-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
1135	1138	-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.-Really? So you're into ballet?
1138	1140	Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.
1141	1144	The famous Bruce Wayne.Rachel's told me everything about you.
1145	1146	I certainly hope not.
1146	1149	-So, let's put a couple of tables together.-I'm not sure that they'll let us.
1149	1152	Oh, they should. I own the place.
1153	1156	How could you want to raise childrenin a city like this?
1156	1158	Well, I was raised here.I turned out okay.
1158	1159	Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
1159	1161	Is--? Heh-heh.
1161	1163	The Palisades? Sure.
1163	1165	You know, as our new DA,you might wanna figure out...
1165	1167	...where your jurisdiction ends.
1167	1171	I'm talking about the kind of citythat idolizes a masked vigilante.
1171	1174	Gotham City is proud of an ordinarycitizen standing up for what's right.
1174	1177	Gotham needs heroes like you,elected officials...
1177	1179	...not a man who thinkshe's above the law.
1179	1180	Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
1180	1184	We did. All of us who stood byand let scum take control of our city.
1184	1186	But this is a democracy, Harvey.
1186	1187	When their enemies were at the gates...
1188	1191	...the Romans would suspend democracyand appoint one man to protect the city.
1191	1194	It wasn't considered an honor,it was considered a public service.
1194	1196	Harvey, the last manthat they appointed...
1196	1198	...to protect the republicwas named Caesar...
1198	1201	-...and he never gave up his power.-Okay, fine.
1202	1203	You either die a hero...
1203	1206	...or you live long enoughto see yourself become the villain.
1206	1209	Look, Whoever the Batman is, he doesn'twanna do this for the rest of his life.
1210	1213	How could he? Batman is looking forsomeone to take up his mantle.
1213	1215	Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
1216	1218	Maybe. If I'm up to it.
1218	1223	What if Harvey Dentis the Caped Crusader? Hm?
1225	1228	If I were sneaking out every night,someone would've noticed by now.
1231	1235	Well, I'm sold, Dent,and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.
1235	1237	That's nice of you Bruce, but I'm notup for re-election for three years.
1238	1239	No, you don't understand.
1240	1242	One fundraiser with my pals...
1243	1245	...you'll never need another cent.
1259	1261	What the hell is this?
1262	1265	As you're all aware,one of our deposits was stolen.
1265	1269	A relatively small amount, 68 million.
1269	1271	Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
1272	1275	Two-bit wackjob,wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.
1275	1277	He's not the problem. He's a nobody.
1277	1280	The problem is our moneybeing tracked by the cops.
1281	1283	Thanks to Mr. Maroni'swell-placed sources...
1283	1287	...we know that police have indeedidentified our banks using marked bills...
1287	1289	...and are planning toseize your funds today.
1290	1293	And since the enthusiastic new DA hasput all my competitors out of business...
1294	1297	-...I'm your only option.So, what are you proposing?
1298	1301	Moving all deposits toone secure location, not a bank.
1301	1303	-Where, then?-No one can know but me.
1304	1306	If the police were to gain leverageover one of you...
1307	1308	...everyone's money would be at stake.
1308	1311	What stop them getting to you?
1311	1314	I go to Hong Kong,far from Dent's jurisdiction...
1314	1317	...and the Chinese will not extraditeone of their own.
1317	1318	How soon can you move the money?
1319	1320	I already have.
1322	1325	For obvious reasons, I couldn't waitfor your permission.
1325	1329	Rest assured, your money is safe.
1336	1340	Oh, hee-hee, aha.Ha, ooh, hee, ha, ha-ha.
1341	1343	And I thought my jokes were bad.
1343	1346	Give me one reason why I shouldn'thave my boy here pull your head off.
1346	1347	How about a magic trick?
1350	1353	I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
1355	1356	Ta-da!
1356	1358	It's--
1358	1360	It's gone.
1360	1363	Oh, and by the way,the suit, it wasn't cheap.
1363	1365	-You ought to know, you bought it.Sit.
1366	1369	I want to hear proposition.
1372	1374	Let's wind the clocks back a year.
1375	1380	These cops and lawyerswouldn't dare cross any of you.
1381	1383	I mean, what happened?
1383	1387	Did your balls drop off? Hm?
1387	1389	You see, a guy like me....
1390	1392	-A freak.Damn right.
1392	1395	A guy like me-- Look, listen.
1396	1400	I know why you chooseto have your little, ahem...
1400	1403	...group-therapy sessionsin broad daylight.
1403	1406	I know why you're afraidto go out at night.
1408	1410	The Batman.
1410	1415	See, Batman has shown Gothamyour true colors, unfortunately.
1415	1418	Dent, he's just the beginning.
1419	1424	And as for the television'sso-called plan...
1424	1426	...Batman has no jurisdiction.
1426	1428	He'll find him and make him squeal.
1429	1431	I know the squealers when I see them...
1432	1433	...and....
1434	1435	What do you propose?
1436	1438	It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.
1439	1442	If it's so simple, why haven'tyou done it already?
1442	1445	If you're good at something,never do it for free.
1445	1447	How much you want?
1447	1449	Uh, half.
1451	1454	You're crazy.-No, I'm not.
1454	1456	No, I'm not.
1458	1461	If we don't deal with this now...
1461	1463	...soon...
1463	1468	...little Gambol here won't be ableto get a nickel for his grandma.
1468	1470	Enough from the clown!
1470	1473	Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...
1473	1475	Shit!-...this out of proportion.
1475	1478	You think you can steal from usand just walk away?
1478	1479	-Yeah.I'm putting the word out.
1480	1482	Five hundred grand for this clown dead.
1482	1485	A million alive, so I can teach himsome manners first.
1486	1489	All right. So, listen,why don't you give me a call...
1489	1492	...when you wanna start taking thingsa little more seriously?
1493	1494	Here's my card.
1498	1500	Mm-mm.
1514	1516	You're a hard man to reach.
1519	1521	Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.
1522	1525	If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.I told you to keep me in the loop.
1525	1528	All that was left in the vaultswere marked bills.
1528	1531	They knew we were coming.As soon as your office got involved--
1531	1532	My office?
1532	1536	You're sitting down there with scum likeWuertz and Ramirez and you're talking--
1536	1539	Oh, yeah Gordon. I almost had your rookiecold on a racketeering beat.
1539	1544	Don't try and cloud the fact that clearlyMaroni's got people in your office, Dent.
1546	1548	We need Lau back...
1548	1552	...but the Chinese won't extraditea national under any circumstances.
1552	1555	If I get him to you,can you get him to talk?
1555	1556	I'll get him to sing.
1556	1559	We're going after the Mob's life savings.
1559	1560	Things will get ugly.
1561	1563	I knew the risk when I took this job,Lieutenant.
1563	1564	How will you get him back, any--?
1567	1568	He does that.
1568	1572	Our Chinese friends left townbefore I could tell them the deal was off.
1572	1575	Well, I'm sure that you've alwayswanted to go to Hong Kong.
1575	1578	What's wrong with a phone call?
1578	1581	I think Mr. Lau deservesa more personal touch.
1582	1584	Now, for high-altitude jumps...
1584	1587	...you're going to need oxygenand stabilizers.
1587	1591	Well, I must say,compared to your usual requests...
1591	1593	...jumping out of an airplaneis pretty straightforward.
1594	1596	What about getting back into the plane?
1596	1600	-I'd recommend a good travel agent.-Without it landing.
1601	1603	Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.
1604	1607	The CIA had a programback in the '60s...
1607	1610	...for getting their people outof hot spots called Sky Hook.
1610	1613	-We could look into that.-Yeah.
1613	1614	Okay. Now....
1616	1618	Hardened Kevlar platesover titanium-dipped...
1619	1621	...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.
1621	1623	You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.
1627	1629	Perhaps you shouldread the instructions first?
1629	1631	-Yeah.-Now, there is a tradeoff.
1631	1635	Separation of the plates makes youmore vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
1635	1638	We wouldn't wanna make thingstoo easy, now, would we?
1638	1640	How will it hold up against dogs?
1640	1642	We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?
1643	1645	Should do fine against cats.
1646	1648	I found one in Arizona.
1648	1651	A very nice man said he could have itup and running in a week...
1651	1652	...and he'd take the cash.
1652	1655	-What about the flight crew?-South Korean smugglers.
1655	1657	They run flights into Pyongyang,below radar the whole way.
1657	1660	-Did you think of an alibi?-Oh, yes.
1678	1680	I believe this is your plane, sir.
1684	1688	You look tired, Alfred.You'll be all right without me?
1689	1693	If you can tell me the Russian for"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."
1703	1707	Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.They say they've just killed the Joker.
1707	1709	They brought the body.
1725	1727	So, dead, that's 500.
1729	1731	How about alive? Hm?
1734	1737	You wanna know how I got these scars?
1739	1741	My father was...
1742	1743	...a drinker...
1743	1744	...and a fiend.
1745	1749	And one night,he goes off crazier than usual.
1750	1752	Mommy gets the kitchen knifeto defend herself.
1752	1754	He doesn't like that...
1754	1757	...not one bit.
1758	1760	So, me watching...
1760	1765	...he takes the knife to her,laughing while he does it.
1765	1768	He turns to me and he says:
1768	1771	"Why so serious?"
1772	1773	He comes at me with the knife.
1774	1776	"Why so serious?"
1778	1780	He sticks the blade in my mouth.
1781	1785	"Let's put a smile on that face."
1786	1788	And....
1790	1792	Why so serious?
1796	1798	Now...
1798	1800	...our operation is small...
1800	1803	...but there is a lot of potential...
1803	1806	...for aggressive expansion.
1806	1809	So which of you fine gentlemenwould like to join our team?
1809	1813	Oh. There's only one spot openright now, so we're gonna have...
1814	1816	...tryouts.
1821	1822	Make it fast.
1831	1833	Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.
1833	1836	Mr. Lau regrets he is unableto greet you in person today.
1836	1838	I understand.
1847	1850	For security purposes, I'm gonna have toask you to check in your mobile.
1851	1852	Of course.
1855	1858	I must apologize for leaving Gothamin the middle of our negotiations.
1858	1862	This misunderstandingwith the Gotham police force...
1862	1864	-...I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company.-Of course.
1865	1868	A businessman of your staturewill understand and...
1868	1872	...with you here now, we can continue.
1872	1875	Well, I do appreciate you bringing meout here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re--
1877	1879	We do not allow cell phones in here.
1879	1881	I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.
1882	1886	No, I really came to tell you thatour business deal has to be put on hold.
1887	1889	You see, we can't affordto be seen to do business with...
1891	1892	...whatever it is you're accused of being.
1893	1895	I'm sure a businessman of your staturewill understand.
1895	1899	I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone callmight have sufficed.
1899	1902	Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think thathe was deliberately wasting your time.
1903	1904	Just accidentally wasting it.
1905	1909	That's very good, Mr. Lau."Accidentally." Very good.
1910	1911	Hey, sir.
1929	1931	There's a better viewfrom the peak tram.
1931	1932	How's the view from LSI Holdings?
1933	1934	Restricted.
1934	1936	Lau is holed up in there good and tight.
1936	1938	-What's this?-I had R&D work it up.
1938	1940	Sends out a high-frequency pulse...
1940	1943	...records the response timefor mapping an environment.
1943	1946	Sonar. Just like a....
1946	1948	Submarine, Mr. Wayne.Like a submarine.
1949	1950	-And the other device?-It's in place.
1951	1952	Mr. Wayne?
1953	1955	Good luck.
2175	2178	Look, give us the moneyand we'll talk about making a deal.
2178	2182	The money is the only reasonI'm still alive.
2182	2186	Oh, you mean, when they find out thatyou've helped us, they're gonna kill you?
2186	2187	-Are you threatening my client?-No.
2188	2192	I'm just assuming your client'scooperation with this investigation.
2193	2195	As will everyone.
2196	2199	No? Okay.
2200	2203	Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.
2203	2204	Wait!
2204	2206	I won't give you the money...
2207	2209	...but I will give you my clients,all of them.
2210	2212	You were a glorified accountant.
2212	2216	What could you possibly haveon all of them that we could charge?
2216	2219	I'm good with calculation.I handled all their investments.
2220	2221	One big part.
2222	2224	Got it.
2224	2226	One minute.
2227	2229	RICO. If they pooled their money...
2229	2231	...we can charge them allas one criminal conspiracy.
2231	2232	Charge them with what?
2233	2235	In a RICO case, if you can charge oneof the conspirators with a felony--
2236	2238	You can charge all of them with it.That's great.
2239	2241	Mr. Lau.
2242	2246	What kind of details do you haveabout this communal fund?
2246	2248	-Ledgers--?-Immunity, protection...
2248	2251	-...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.-After you testify in open court.
2251	2254	And I'm just curious,with all your clients locked up...
2254	2256	...what's gonna happenwith all that money?
2256	2259	Like I said, I'm good with calculation.
2259	2264	He can't go to County.I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
2264	2266	What is this, Gordon, your fortress?
2267	2269	Well, you trust them over at County?
2269	2271	I don't trust them here.
2273	2274	Lau stays.
2275	2277	Well, I don't know aboutMr. Lau's travel arrangements...
2277	2279	...but I'm sure glad he's back.
2279	2282	Put word out. We hire the clown.
2284	2288	He was right.We have to fix real problem.
2288	2290	Batman.
2294	2297	-I'm not aware of any participation bythe Batman in these investigations....
2297	2298	Our boy looks good on the tube.
2298	2301	You sure you wanna embarrass mein front of my friends, Lieutenant?
2301	2304	Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.
2311	2313	Have a nice trip. See you next fall.
2313	2315	Seven hundred twelvecounts of extortion.
2315	2317	Eight hundred and forty-ninecounts of racketeering.
2317	2320	Two hundred and forty-sixcounts of fraud.
2320	2323	Eighty-seven countsof conspiracy murder.
2324	2327	Five hundred and twenty-sevencounts of obstruction of justice.
2327	2328	How do the defendants plead?
2335	2336	Order in the court.
2336	2339	Five hundred and forty-ninecriminals at once.
2339	2341	How did you convince Surrilloto hear this farce?
2341	2345	She shares my enthusiasm for justice.After all, she is a judge.
2346	2348	Well, even if you blow enough smoketo get convictions out of Surrillo...
2349	2351	...you're gonna set a new record at appealsfor the quickest kick in the ass.
2351	2354	It won't matter.The head guys make bail, sure.
2354	2356	But the mid-level guys, they can't.
2356	2358	They can't afford to be off the streetslong enough for trial and appeal.
2358	2360	They'll cut deals thatinclude some jail time.
2360	2363	Think of all you could dowith 18 months of clean streets.
2365	2368	Mr. Mayor, you can't---No, get out. Both of you.
2372	2373	Sit down.
2378	2381	The public likes you. That's theonly reason that this might fly.
2381	2382	But that means it's on you.
2382	2385	They're all gonna come after you now,and not just the Mob.
2386	2389	Politicians, journalists, cops.
2389	2392	Anyone whose wallet'sabout to get lighter.
2392	2395	Are you up to it? You'd better be.
2395	2397	Because they get anything on you...
2397	2401	...and those criminals are back on thestreets, followed swiftly by you and me.
2402	2403	Jesus!
2423	2426	I think your fundraiserwill be a great success, sir.
2426	2428	And why do you think I wannahold a party for Harvey Dent?
2428	2431	I assumed it was your usual reasonfor socializing beyond myself...
2432	2433	...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:
2434	2435	To try to impress Miss Dawes.
2436	2439	Very droll, but very wrong.Actually, it's Dent.
2440	2442	Police released videofootage found concealed on the body.
2443	2445	Sensitive viewers, be aware.The image is disturbing.
2445	2447	Tell them your name.
2447	2449	Brian Douglas.
2451	2453	And are you the real Batman?
2453	2454	No.No?
2454	2456	-No.-No?
2456	2458	Then why do you dress up like him?
2459	2460	Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
2460	2464	Because he's a symbol that wedon't have to be afraid of scum like you.
2465	2468	Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.
2468	2471	Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.
2472	2476	So you think Batman'smade Gotham a better place? Hm?
2476	2478	Look at me.
2478	2480	Look at me!
2483	2487	You see, this is how crazyBatman's made Gotham.
2487	2489	You want order in Gotham...
2490	2494	...Batman must take off his maskand turn himself in.
2494	2498	Oh, and every day he doesn't,people will die.
2498	2500	Starting tonight.
2500	2502	I'm a man of my word.
2519	2522	Harvey Dent,scourge of the underworld...
2522	2525	...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.
2525	2526	-I'll be back.-Rachel.
2526	2529	A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?
2529	2532	-Thank you. Alfred, right?-That's right, sir.
2532	2535	Rachel talks about you all the time.You've known her her whole life.
2535	2536	Not yet, sir.
2538	2541	Any psychotic ex-boyfriendsI should be aware of?
2541	2543	Oh, you have no idea.
2561	2562	I'm sorry that I'm late.
2563	2565	I'm glad to seethat you all got started without me.
2565	2569	Now, where is Harvey? Where--?
2569	2571	Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.
2571	2573	Where's Rachel Dawes?
2573	2575	She is my oldest friend. Come here.
2575	2578	You know, when Rachel first told methat she was dating Harvey Dent...
2578	2579	...I had one thing to say:
2579	2581	The guy from those God-awfulcampaign commercials?
2582	2585	"I believe in Harvey Dent."Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.
2585	2587	But it caught Rachel's attention.
2587	2590	And then I started to pay attentionto Harvey...
2591	2594	...and all that he's been doingas our new DA.
2594	2596	And you know what?
2598	2599	I believe in Harvey Dent.
2599	2603	I believe that on his watch,Gotham can feel...
2603	2606	...a little safer, a little more optimistic.
2608	2612	Look at this face. This is the faceof Gotham's bright future.
2612	2614	To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.
2615	2616	Harvey.
2625	2627	Harvey may not know youwell enough...
2627	2629	...to understand when you'remaking fun of him...
2629	2631	-...but I do.-No, I meant every word.
2632	2635	You know that daythat you once told me about...
2635	2637	...when Gotham would no longerneed Batman?
2637	2639	-It's coming.-Bruce.
2640	2645	-You can't ask me to wait for that.-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.
2645	2650	He locked up half of the city's criminals,and he did it without wearing a mask.
2650	2652	Gotham needs a hero with a face.
2653	2655	You can throw a party, Wayne,I'll give you that.
2656	2658	Thanks again.
2659	2660	You mind if I borrow Rachel?
2664	2666	Lieutenant, that joker cardpinned to the body?
2666	2668	Forensics found three sets of DNA.
2668	2669	-Any matches?-All three.
2669	2673	The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
2673	2675	The Joker's telling uswho he's targeting.
2675	2678	Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
2678	2680	Get them both into protective custody.Where's the Commissioner?
2680	2682	-City hall.-Seal the building.
2682	2684	-No one in or out till I get there.-Got it.
2695	2698	Gordon. What are you up to?
2698	2701	We're secure. I want a floor-by-floorsearch of the entire building.
2701	2704	Sorry Sir, We believe the Joker'smade a threat against your life.
2704	2705	These are dangerous people, Judge.
2705	2707	Yea, but you're not giving mean awful lot of information.
2707	2709	Even we don't knowwhere you're going.
2709	2712	Take the envelope, get in, open it.It'll tell you where you're headed.
2716	2718	You can not leave me alonewith these people.
2718	2721	The whole Mob's after youand you're worried about these guys?
2721	2723	Yeah, compared to this,the Mob doesn't scare me.
2723	2727	Gordon, you're unlikely to discover thisfor yourself, so...
2727	2731	...take my word, the police Commissionerearns a lot of threats.
2731	2736	I found the appropriate responseto these situations a long time ago.
2736	2739	Them gunning for youmakes you see things clearly.
2739	2740	Yeah, I bet.
2740	2744	Yeah. It makes you think about thingsyou couldn't stand losing...
2744	2746	...about who you wanna spend therest of your life with.
2747	2749	-That's a pretty big commitment.-Well, not if the Mob has their way.
2754	2757	You get to explain to my wife...
2758	2759	...why I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.
2760	2763	Sir, the joker cardhad traces of your DNA on it.
2764	2767	-Don't do that.-All right.
2767	2770	-Let's be serious, then.-Okay.
2770	2771	What's your answer?
2777	2779	I don't have an answer.
2781	2782	How'd they get my DNA?
2782	2784	Somebody with accessto your office or your house...
2784	2787	...must have lifted a tissueor a glass-- Wait! Wait! Wait!
2787	2790	-Well, I guess no answer is a no.-Harvey.
2790	2792	-It's someone else, isn't it?-Harvey.
2792	2795	Just tell me it's not Wayne.The guy's a complete f--
2795	2797	What are you doing?
2808	2809	Oh, shit.
2815	2816	Get a medic!
2819	2821	They've come for him.
2822	2823	We made it.
2826	2827	Stay hidden.
2829	2832	Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.
2835	2839	We are tonight's entertainment.
2839	2842	I only have one question:
2842	2845	Where is Harvey Dent?
2854	2856	You know where Harvey is?You know who he is?
2856	2858	Hands up, pretty boy.
2864	2867	Do you know where I can find Harvey?I need to talk to him about something.
2867	2870	Just something little, huh? No.
2872	2875	What's going on out there? Wayne!
2876	2878	Oh, thank God, you'vegot a panic room.
2878	2879	Hey, wait--
2879	2881	Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
2881	2883	You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
2884	2887	We're not intimidated by thugs.
2888	2889	You know...
2891	2894	...you remind me of my father.
2894	2896	I hated my father.
2896	2898	Okay, stop.
2902	2905	Well, hello, beautiful.
2907	2910	You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?
2911	2913	And you are beautiful.
2920	2923	You look nervous. Is it the scars?
2924	2926	You wanna know how I got them?
2928	2930	Come here. Hey.
2930	2932	Look at me.
2933	2937	So I had a wife.She was beautiful, like you...
2937	2941	...who tells me I worry too much...
2942	2944	...who tells me I ought to smile more...
2944	2950	...who gambles and gets in deepwith the sharks. Hey.
2950	2952	One day they carve her face.
2953	2957	And we have no money for surgeries.She can't take it.
2957	2961	I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?
2961	2964	I just want her to knowthat I don't care about the scars.
2964	2966	So...
2966	2970	...I stick a razor in my mouthand do this...
2970	2972	...to myself.
2972	2977	And you know what?She can't stand the sight of me.
2977	2979	She leaves.
2979	2982	Now I see the funny side.
2982	2984	Now I'm always smiling.
2987	2990	Got a little fight in you. I like that.
2991	2992	Then you're gonna love me.
3019	3020	Drop the gun.
3020	3023	Oh, sure. You just take offyour little mask...
3023	3025	...and show us all whoyou really are. Hm?
3030	3031	Let her go.
3032	3034	Very poor choice of words.
3055	3057	Are you all right?
3059	3062	Let's not do that again.
3062	3064	-Is Harvey okay?-He's safe.
3066	3067	Thank you.
3067	3068	Jim, it's over.
3069	3071	As long as they don't get to Lau,we've cut off their funds.
3071	3073	The prosecution's over.
3073	3074	Nobody's standing upin front of a judge...
3075	3078	...while judges and police Commissionersare getting blown away.
3078	3079	-What about Dent?-He's got any sense...
3080	3081	...Dent's halfway to Mex--
3081	3082	So where do you keep your trash?
3084	3087	You're due in court. I need you alivelong enough to get you on the record.
3088	3090	You can't protect me.You can't even protect yourselves.
3091	3094	You refuse to cooperate, you're notcoming back here, you go to County.
3094	3096	How long do you calculateyou'll last in there?
3098	3099	Targeting me won't get their money back.
3099	3101	I knew the Mob wouldn't godown without a fight...
3101	3103	...but this is different.They crossed a line.
3103	3105	You crossed the line first, Sir.
3105	3108	You squeezed them, you hammered themto the point of desperation.
3108	3113	And in their desperation, they turned toa man they didn't fully understand.
3113	3116	Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
3116	3118	We just need to figure outwhat he's after.
3118	3120	With respect, Master Wayne...
3120	3123	...perhaps this is a manyou don't fully understand either.
3123	3126	A long time ago, I was in Burma...
3126	3129	...and my friends and I were workingfor the local government.
3130	3132	They were trying to buythe loyalty of tribal leaders...
3132	3135	...by bribing them withprecious stones...
3135	3140	...but their caravans were being raidedin a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.
3140	3143	So we went looking for the stones.
3143	3148	But in six months, we nevermet anyone who traded with him.
3149	3153	One day, I saw a childplaying with a ruby...
3153	3156	...the size of a tangerine.
3156	3159	The bandit had beenthrowing them away.
3160	3162	-So why steal them?-Well, because he thought it was good sport.
3163	3167	Because some men aren't lookingfor anything logical, like money.
3167	3172	They can't be bought, bullied,reasoned or negotiated with.
3172	3176	Some men just wannawatch the world burn.
3195	3196	Your name, sir?
3197	3200	Eighth and Orchard.You'll find Harvey Dent there.
3212	3213	Check the names.
3220	3221	"Richard Dent."
3223	3224	"Patrick Harvey."
3225	3226	Harvey Dent.
3226	3229	I need 10 minutes with the scenebefore your men contaminate it.
3229	3231	Us contaminate it?It's because of you these guys are dead--
3231	3233	Hey, Detective!
3235	3237	Give us a minute, guys.
3238	3239	That's brick underneath.
3240	3241	Gonna take ballisticsoff a shattered bullet?
3242	3243	No.
3245	3246	Fingerprints.
3255	3256	Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
3258	3263	Because we found his next target.He's put it in tomorrow's paper.
3279	3281	I'm not sureyou made it loud enough, Sir.
3294	3296	What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
3296	3300	You wanted me to do the diligenceon the LSI Holdings deal again.
3300	3303	Well, I found some irregularities.
3303	3305	Their CEO is in police custody.
3305	3308	No, not with their numbers, with yours.
3308	3311	Applied Sciences. Whole divisionof Wayne Enterprises...
3311	3313	...just disappeared overnight.
3313	3317	I went down to the archivesand I started pulling some old files.
3318	3320	Don't tell me you didn'trecognize your baby out there...
3320	3324	...pancaking cop carson the evening news.
3324	3327	Now you got the entire R&DDepartment burning through cash...
3327	3330	...claiming it's related tocell phones for the Army?
3331	3334	What are you building for him now,a rocket ship?
3335	3337	I want...
3337	3341	...10 million dollars a yearfor the rest of my life.
3343	3345	Let me get this straight.
3347	3349	You think that your client...
3349	3352	One of the wealthiest,most powerful men in the world...
3352	3354	...is secretly a vigilante...
3354	3358	...who spends his nights beatingcriminals to a pulp with his bare hands...
3359	3362	...and your planis to blackmail this person?
3369	3370	Good luck.
3373	3374	Well--
3375	3377	Keep that.
3383	3386	This is your original scan.
3387	3389	Here it is re-engineered.
3397	3400	And there's the thumbprint he leftwhen he pushed the round in the clip.
3402	3403	I'll get you a copy.
3404	3407	Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R&D?
3407	3410	Yeah. Governmenttelecommunications project.
3410	3412	I wasn't awarewe had any government contracts.
3412	3415	Lucius, I'm playing this onepretty close to the chest.
3416	3418	Fair enough.
3421	3422	With no word from the Batman...
3422	3424	...even as they mournCommissioner Loeb...
3424	3427	...these cops have to be wondering ifthe Joker will make good on his threat...
3427	3430	...in the obituary column ofThe Gotham Times to kill the mayor.
3432	3436	I've checked all the databases.There are four possibles.
3436	3438	Cross-reference the addresses.
3438	3442	Look for Parkside,overlooking the parade.
3443	3444	I got one.
3444	3448	Melvin White,1502 Randolph Apartments.
3448	3452	Aggravated assault,moved to Arkham twice.
3490	3491	What do you got on the roof?
3491	3495	We're tight, but frankly,there's a lot of windows up here.
3503	3507	Commissioner Loeb dedicated his lifeto law enforcement...
3507	3509	...and to the protectionof his community.
3509	3511	I remember when I first took office...
3511	3514	...and I asked if he wantedto stay on as Commissioner.
3514	3519	And he said he would, providedI kept my politics out of his office.
3523	3526	Clearly he was not a man who mincedwords, nor should he have been.
3527	3530	A number of policies that he enactedas Commissioner were unpopular.
3530	3533	Policies that flooded my officewith angry calls and letters....
3538	3539	-Who's that?-What happened?
3540	3542	They took our guns.
3542	3544	And our uniforms.
3550	3553	And as we recognizethe sacrifice of this man...
3553	3557	...we must remember that vigilanceis the price of safety.
3557	3559	Stand by. Honor guard.
3559	3563	Attention. Port arms.
3564	3568	Ready! Aim! Fire!
3569	3571	Ready! Aim!
3574	3576	Ready! Aim!
3584	3586	Stay down! Don't move!
3587	3589	Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.
3598	3600	-I'll see you later.-Why are you going back?
3612	3613	Get out of here.
3617	3619	Tell me what you know about the Joker.
3649	3650	No.
3650	3651	I'm sorry, Barbara.
3652	3655	Jimmy, go play with your sister.Go ahead, honey.
3656	3658	If there's anythingwe can do, anything you need...
3658	3660	...we're here for you.
3661	3663	Shh.
3663	3664	Are you out there?
3666	3670	Are you? You brought thiscraziness on us. You did!
3670	3672	You brought this on us!
3673	3678	Switch it off, he ain't coming.He doesn't wanna talk to us.
3678	3681	God help whoeverhe does wanna talk to.
3683	3685	Can't we go someplace quieter?We can't hear each other talk.
3686	3688	What makes you thinkI wanna hear you talk?
3689	3690	What?
3718	3719	-Yeah?Second.
3719	3720	Okay.
3721	3723	-Harvey, where are you?Where are you?
3723	3725	I'm where you should be,at Major Crimes.
3725	3727	-I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.-Rachel.
3727	3728	-Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
3728	3730	-Rachel. Rachel, listen to me. You're not safe there.
3730	3732	-Oh, this is Gordon's unit.-Gordon's gone, Rachel.
3732	3736	He vouched for these men.-And he's gone.
3740	3742	The Joker's named you next.
3742	3745	God, is there someone, is there anyonein this town we can trust?
3745	3747	Bruce.
3747	3748	We can trust Bruce Wayne.
3748	3750	No. Rachel, c'mon, I knowyou're his friend, but--
3750	3752	Harvey, trust me.
3752	3755	Bruce's penthouse is nowthe safest place in the city.
3755	3756	Then you go straight there.
3756	3758	You don't tell anybody where youare going and I'll find you there.
3758	3760	I love you.
3774	3775	I want the Joker.
3776	3778	From one professional to another...
3778	3780	...if you're trying to scare somebody,pick a better spot.
3780	3783	From this height,the fall wouldn't kill me.
3783	3784	-I'm counting on it.-Huh!
3792	3795	-Where is he?-I don't know where he is. He found us.
3795	3796	He must have friends.
3796	3798	Friends? Have you met this guy?
3799	3800	Someone knows where he is.
3800	3803	Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
3803	3804	They're wise to your act.
3804	3808	You got rules.The Joker, he's got no rules.
3808	3813	Nobody's gonna cross him for you.If you want this guy, you got one way.
3813	3815	But you already know what that is.
3815	3818	Just take off that mask,let him come find you.
3819	3823	Or you can let a couple more peopleget killed while you make up your mind.
3825	3827	You wanna play games?
3833	3834	How's that feel?
3834	3836	-You wouldn't.-I wouldn't!
3838	3839	-You don't think I will?-Mm-mm.
3840	3842	-You don't think I will?-Mm-mm.
3843	3846	No. No, I wouldn't.
3847	3850	That's why I'm notgonna leave it up to me.
3850	3853	Heads, you get to keep your head.
3854	3855	Tails...
3856	3857	...not so lucky.
3858	3861	So you wanna tell me about the Joker?
3870	3874	-Let's go again.-I don't know anything! I don't!
3874	3876	You're not playing the odds, friend.
3877	3879	Let's do it again.
3882	3883	You'd leave a man's life to chance?
3884	3888	-Not exactly.-His name's Schiff, Thomas.
3888	3891	He's a paranoid schizophrenic,former patient at Arkham.
3891	3895	The kind of mind the Joker attracts.What do you expect to learn from him?
3898	3901	The Joker killed Gordon.He's gonna kill Rachel.
3901	3904	You're the symbol of hopeI could never be.
3904	3906	Your stand against organized crime...
3906	3909	...is the first legitimate ray of lightin Gotham in decades.
3909	3913	If anyone saw this,everything would be undone.
3913	3915	All the criminals you pulled off thestreets would be released...
3915	3918	...and Jim Gordonwill have died for nothing.
3919	3921	You're gonna hold a pressconference tomorrow morning.
3921	3923	-Why?-No one else will die because of me.
3924	3926	Gotham's in your hands now.
3926	3928	You can't.
3928	3929	You can't give in.
3929	3932	You can't give in!
3947	3948	Harvey called.
3948	3951	He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.
3951	3952	I have no choice.
3952	3955	You honestly think that's gonnakeep the Joker from killing people?
3955	3959	Maybe not. But I have enoughblood on my hands.
3959	3964	And I've seen now, what I wouldhave to become to stop men like him.
3964	3968	You once told me thatif the day came when I was finished...
3968	3970	...that we'd be together.
3970	3974	Bruce, don't make meyour one hope for a normal life.
3975	3976	Did you mean it?
3978	3979	Yes.
3996	3998	Bruce.
3999	4002	If you turn yourself in,they're not gonna let us be together.
4013	4015	Logs as well?Everything.
4016	4019	Anything that could lead backto Lucius or Rachel.
4024	4027	People are dying, Alfred.What would you have me do?
4027	4031	Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
4031	4035	They'll hate you for it,but that's the point of Batman.
4035	4040	He can be the outcast. He can makethe choice that no one else can make.
4040	4042	The right choice.
4042	4045	No, today I found outwhat Batman can't do.
4045	4046	He can't endure this.
4047	4049	Today you get to say "I told you so."
4050	4053	Today, I don't want to.
4059	4060	But I did bloody tell you.
4063	4066	I suppose they're gonnalock me up as well...
4067	4068	...as your accomplice.
4068	4072	Accomplice? I'm gonna tell themthe whole thing was your idea.
4077	4079	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.
4079	4080	I've called this press conference for two reasons.
4080	4082	Firstly, to assure the citizensof Gotham...
4082	4086	...that everything that can be doneover the Joker killings is being done.
4087	4090	Secondly, because the Batmanhas offered to turn himself in.
4090	4092	But first, let's consider the situation.
4092	4095	Should we give into this terrorist's demands?
4095	4096	Do we really think he's gonna--?
4096	4100	You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilantethan the lives of citizens?
4100	4102	The Batman is an outlaw.
4103	4105	But, that's not why wedemand he turn himself in...
4105	4107	...we're doing it because we're scared.
4107	4109	We've been happy to let the Batmanclean up our streets for us until now.
4110	4112	Things are worse than ever!Amen.
4114	4115	Yes, they are.
4118	4121	But the night is darkestjust before the dawn.
4123	4125	And I promise you...
4126	4127	...the dawn is coming.
4127	4132	One day, the Batman will have to answerfor the laws he's broken. But to us...
4132	4134	...not to this madman.
4134	4136	-No more dead cops!Yeah!
4139	4141	He should turn himself in!
4141	4143	Give us the Batman! Come on!Where is he?
4146	4148	So be it. Take the Batman into custody.
4149	4151	What?Is he here?
4151	4152	I am the Batman.
4153	4155	What?Come on.
4164	4165	Alfred.
4167	4168	Why is he letting Harvey do this?
4169	4171	-He went down to the press conference.-I know. He just stood by.
4172	4174	Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...
4174	4177	...believe that Batman stands forsomething more important...
4177	4179	...than the whims of a terrorist,Miss Dawes...
4179	4181	...even if everyone hates him for it.
4181	4183	That's the sacrifice he's making.
4183	4187	He's not being a hero.He's being something more.
4187	4189	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
4189	4192	Letting Harvey take the fall for thisis not heroic at all.
4195	4196	You know him better than anyone.
4197	4198	I do.
4201	4204	Will you give this to him for me?When the time is right?
4205	4206	How will I know?
4207	4208	It's not sealed.
4209	4211	Goodbye, Alfred.
4215	4216	Bye, Rachel.
4224	4226	Sorry, I didn't have time to talkthis through with you.
4226	4227	What are you doing?
4227	4229	They're transferring meto Central Holding.
4230	4233	This is the Joker's chance, and when heattacks, the Batman will take him down.
4233	4235	Listen to me. This is too dangerous.
4235	4236	We get this guy to County,he's their problem.
4236	4238	Streets will becleared along your route...
4239	4242	...so let's go.Convoy stops for no reason.
4242	4244	I hope you got some moves, pal.
4244	4247	He's using you as bait. He doesn'teven know if he can get the Joker.
4247	4248	He's failed so far.
4248	4250	How do you knowwhat he's thinking?
4250	4252	I just... I do. Anyway, Harvey,this isn't just about you.
4252	4254	What about all of the peoplewho are depending on you...
4254	4257	...to clean the city upand do it honorably and--?
4263	4265	Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.
4265	4267	Heads, I go through with it.
4267	4271	This is your life. You can't leavesomething like that to chance.
4272	4272	I'm not.
4276	4278	You make your own luck.
4299	4301	Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.
4308	4311	What the hell is that?
4311	4313	Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!
4313	4316	Damn it! All units divert downonto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.
4316	4318	Exit down!
4318	4320	Lower Fifth? We'll be like turkeyson Thanksgiving down there.
4351	4354	Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.Let's go.
4356	4358	Listen, we need backup.We've got company.
4358	4360	We got trouble, guys.
4362	4363	Lock and load!
4374	4375	What the hell was that?
4396	4399	-These things are built for that, right?-He's gonna need something...
4399	4401	...a lot bigger to get through this.
4402	4403	What is that?
4405	4406	What is that, a bazooka?
4414	4416	I didn't sign up for this!
4431	4433	Look out.
4433	4435	Look out!
4443	4444	Hmm.
4456	4457	Come on, let's go!
4502	4504	Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.
4504	4507	Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.
4511	4515	Scanning all systems.Scanning all systems.
4522	4524	We gotta get topside.We need air support, now!
4529	4531	I like this job. I like it.
4533	4536	Damage catastrophic.Eject sequence initiated.
4549	4551	Goodbye.
4559	4562	We're on point, ready to give themsome of their own medicine.
4569	4571	That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.
4584	4586	Okay, rack them up.
4586	4588	Rack them up, rack them up,rack them up.
4613	4614	That's not good.
4617	4618	Okay, that's not good!
4660	4662	Now, there's a Batman.
4666	4667	Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.
4670	4671	Come on.
4680	4681	He missed!
4694	4697	You can't stop here.We're like sitting ducks!
4713	4714	Come on, come on.
4717	4720	Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,I want you to do it. Come on!
4723	4724	Come on.
4725	4728	Come on, come on. I want you to do it,I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.
4728	4730	Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!
4732	4733	Hit me!
4757	4760	Come on. Aah!
4760	4762	Could you please just give me a minute?
4764	4766	We got you, you son of a bitch.
4769	4773	Gor-- You do like to play thingspretty close to the chest.
4773	4775	We got him, Harvey.
4775	4778	Mr. Dent! How does it feelto be the biggest hero in Gotham?
4778	4782	No, I'm no hero.Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.
4782	4783	But you and your office...
4783	4785	...have been workingwith the Batman all along.
4785	4787	No, but I trusted himto do the right thing.
4787	4789	Which was?-Saving my ass.
4789	4792	All right, people, that's enough.Let him be. Let him be.
4792	4794	Thank you, Detective.
4794	4796	I've got a datewith a pretty upset girlfriend.
4796	4798	-I figured, counselor.Mr. Dent, sir...
4799	4803	-...how about one for the front page, sir?Mr. Dent.
4813	4816	Stand away! All of you!
4817	4820	I don't want anything for his Mob lawyerto use, you understand?
4822	4824	Back from the dead.
4825	4826	I, uh...
4826	4828	...couldn't risk my family's safety.
4829	4831	What do we got?
4833	4836	Nothing. No matches on prints,DNA, dental.
4837	4839	Clothing is custom, no labels.
4839	4841	Nothing in his pocketsbut knives and lint.
4842	4843	No name.
4844	4846	-No other alias.Go home, Gordon.
4846	4849	The clown'll keep till morning.Go get some rest.
4849	4851	You're gonna need it.
4851	4853	Tomorrow you take the big job.
4854	4857	You don't have any say in the matter.Commissioner Gordon.
4872	4874	I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.
4881	4882	Look at these ugly bastards.
4882	4884	-I don't feel good.You're a cop killer.
4884	4886	You're lucky to be feeling anythingbelow the neck.
4886	4888	-Please!-Step away from the bars!
4888	4890	My insides hurt.
4904	4906	Did Batman save you, Daddy?
4908	4910	Actually, this time...
4910	4912	...I saved him.
4923	4925	Has he said anything yet?
4932	4936	Evening, Commissioner.
4943	4945	Harvey Dent never made it home.
4945	4947	-Of course not.-What have you done with him?
4948	4950	Me?
4952	4954	I was right here.
4955	4957	Who did you leave him with?
4957	4960	Hm? Your people?
4961	4964	Assuming, of course,that they are still your people...
4964	4967	...and not Maroni's.
4969	4971	Does it depress you, Commissioner...
4971	4976	...to know just how alone you really are?
4978	4983	Does it make you feel responsiblefor Harvey Dent's current predicament?
4983	4986	-Where is he?-What's the time?
4986	4987	What difference does that make?
4988	4993	Well, depending on the time,he may be in one spot or several.
4999	5002	-If we're gonna play games...-Mm-hm?
5005	5007	...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
5007	5011	Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?
5012	5013	Not exactly.
5023	5027	Never start with the head. The victimgets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next--
5030	5031	See?
5031	5033	You wanted me. Here I am.
5034	5036	I wanted to see what you'd do.
5037	5039	And you didn't disappoint.
5039	5042	You let five people die.
5043	5046	Then you let Dent take your place.
5047	5049	-Even to a guy like me, that's cold.-Where's Dent?
5049	5054	Those Mob fools want you gone so theycan get back to the way things were.
5054	5059	But I know the truth. There's nogoing back. You've changed things.
5059	5061	-Forever.-Then why do you wanna kill me?
5064	5066	I don't wanna kill you.
5066	5070	What would I do without you? Go backto ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.
5071	5073	No. No, you....
5073	5075	You complete me.
5075	5080	-You're garbage who kills for money.-Don't talk like one of them. You're not.
5080	5082	Even if you'd like to be.
5083	5085	To them, you're just a freak...
5086	5087	...like me.
5087	5090	They need you right now...
5090	5092	...but when they don't...
5093	5096	...they'll cast you out like a leper.
5096	5099	You see, their morals, their code...
5100	5102	...it's a bad joke.
5102	5105	Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
5106	5110	They're only as good as the worldallows them to be. I'll show you.
5110	5113	When the chips are down, these--
5113	5115	These civilized people...
5115	5117	...they'll eat each other.
5118	5120	See, I'm not a monster.
5122	5123	I'm just ahead of the curve.
5125	5126	Where's Dent?
5126	5129	You have all these rules,and you think they'll save you.
5132	5134	-He's in control.-I have one rule.
5135	5137	Oh. Then that's the rule you'll haveto break to know the truth.
5138	5139	Which is?
5139	5141	The only sensible way to livein this world is without rules.
5141	5144	And tonight you're gonna breakyour one rule.
5144	5145	I'm considering it.
5145	5148	No, there's only minutes left, you'regonna have to play my little game...
5148	5150	...if you wanna save one of them.
5151	5152	"Them"?
5152	5156	You know, for a while there,I thought you really were Dent.
5156	5159	The way you threw yourself after her.
5165	5166	Look at you go.
5171	5175	Does Harvey knowabout you and his little bunny?
5175	5177	Where are they?!
5177	5179	Killing is making a choice.
5179	5182	-Where are they?!-Choose between one life or the other.
5183	5187	Your friend the district attorney,or his blushing bride-to-be.
5192	5196	You have nothing,nothing to threaten me with.
5196	5199	Nothing to do with all your strength.
5200	5203	Don't worry, I'm gonna tell youwhere they are, both of them.
5203	5206	And that's the point.You'll have to choose.
5207	5209	He's at 250 52nd Street...
5210	5213	...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.
5215	5216	-Which one you going after?-Rachel.
5218	5219	We're getting Dent!
5221	5224	250 52nd Street!
5227	5229	Hello?
5230	5232	Can anybody hear me?
5234	5237	Hello!
5240	5243	-Rachel?-Harvey.
5243	5245	Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?
5245	5247	I'm all right. I'm in a--
5247	5250	I'm in a warehouse.They got me wired to these oil drums.
5251	5252	I am too.
5253	5255	Harvey.
5261	5264	I want my phone call.
5264	5267	I want it. I want it.I want my phone call.
5267	5269	That's nice.
5271	5275	How many of your friends have I killed?
5279	5280	I'm a 20-year man...
5280	5283	...and I know the difference betweenpunks who need a little lesson in manners...
5283	5286	...and the freaks like youwho would just enjoy it.
5287	5289	And you killed six of my friends.
5290	5291	Six?
5291	5293	Please. My insides hurt.
5293	5295	I don't really care. Back away.
5295	5298	The boss said he'd make the voicesgo away.
5298	5302	He said he'd go insideand replace them with bright lights...
5302	5303	...like Christmas.
5303	5306	You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.
5306	5308	Get a medic to the holding tank.Come on. Get the door open.
5309	5310	You guys, back off!
5310	5312	Listen, we don't have a lot of time.
5312	5316	They told me that only one of uswas gonna make it...
5316	5319	...and that they were gonnalet our friends choose.
5322	5324	Okay, Rachel.
5325	5328	It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.They're coming for you.
5328	5332	Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk methrough what's going on with you.
5332	5334	Can you find something,anything, sharp?
5334	5335	I'm trying.
5335	5338	-What's--?-Shit.
5338	5339	Harvey?
5343	5344	Harvey, what's happening?
5353	5357	All available units,converge at 250 52nd Street.
5357	5361	Do you wanna know why I use a knife?
5363	5365	Guns are too quick.
5365	5368	You can't savor all the...
5368	5371	...little emotions.
5373	5378	You see, in their last moments...
5378	5380	...people show you who they really are.
5381	5387	So in a way, I knew your friendsbetter than you ever did.
5390	5394	Would you like to knowwhich of them were cowards?
5400	5402	What's that?Jeez.
5402	5404	He's got some kind of a...
5404	5407	-...contusion.-I know you're gonna enjoy this.
5408	5412	I'm gonna have to try and enjoy iteven more.
5417	5418	Whoa, whoa!
5419	5420	Just put it down.
5420	5423	Take it easy. Take it easy.Drop the weapon now!
5423	5427	-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!-Let him go now! Drop it!
5427	5430	-What? Sorry?-What do you want?
5431	5433	I just want my phone call.
5436	5438	What--? What--? What's happening?
5439	5441	Just talk to me, just for one second.
5443	5446	-All right?-Right.
5448	5449	Ow.
5450	5452	-Ow.-Shh, shh, shh.
5457	5459	Is that a phone?
5469	5470	Mount the curb!
5478	5481	Harvey, just in case,I wanna tell you something, okay?
5482	5483	Don't think like that, Rachel.They're coming for you.
5483	5486	I know they are,but I don't want them to.
5490	5494	I don't wanna live without you,and I do have an answer for you.
5494	5496	My answer is yes.
5499	5501	No! No! No!
5501	5504	Not me! Why you coming for me?
5504	5505	No!
5507	5508	Rachel! Rachel!
5508	5511	-Harvey.-No! No! Rachel!

5519	5520	Some--
5526	5527	No, Commissioner!
5527	5530	Rachel! No!
5544	5545	Hello there.
5550	5554	Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.
5555	5556	With Lau?
5559	5561	The Joker planned to be caught.
5562	5564	He wanted me to lock him upin the MCU.
5583	5585	Dear Bruce:
5586	5589	I need to be honest and clear.
5591	5593	I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
5593	5597	I love him, and I wanna spendthe rest of my life with him.
5598	5602	When I told you that if Gotham no longerneeded Batman, we could be together...
5602	5604	...I meant it.
5604	5609	But now I'm sure the day won't comewhen you no longer need Batman.
5610	5612	I hope it does.
5612	5615	And if it does, I will be there...
5615	5616	...but as your friend.
5617	5619	I'm sorry, Harvey.
5619	5622	I'm sorry to let you down.
5622	5627	If you lose your faith in me,please keep your faith in people.
5627	5631	Love, now and always, Rachel.
5639	5641	Prepared a little breakfast.
5645	5647	-Very well, then.-Alfred.
5647	5648	Yes, Master Wayne?
5650	5652	Did I bring this on her?
5653	5655	I was meant to inspire good...
5655	5657	...not madness, not death.
5658	5662	You have inspired good. But you spatin the faces of Gotham's criminals.
5662	5664	Didn't you thinkthere might be some casualties?
5664	5667	Things are always going to get worsebefore they got better.
5667	5668	But Rachel, Alfred.
5669	5672	Rachel believed in what you stood for...
5672	5674	...what we stand for.
5674	5676	Gotham needs you.
5676	5679	No, Gotham needs its true hero...
5680	5684	...and I let that murdering psychopathblow him half to hell.
5684	5686	Which is why, for now...
5687	5689	...they're gonna have tomake do with you.
5691	5692	She was going to wait for me, Alfred.
5694	5696	Dent doesn't know.
5696	5698	He can never know.
5700	5702	What's that?
5702	5705	-It can wait.-That bandit...
5705	5707	...in the forest in Burma.
5707	5709	-Did you catch him?-Yes.
5709	5711	How?
5712	5714	We burned the forest down.
5751	5754	He's credible source, an M&A lawyerfrom a prestigious consultancy, and
5754	5757	He says he's waited as long as he canfor the Batman to do the right thing.
5757	5759	And now he's taking mattersinto his own hands.
5759	5762	We'll be live at 5 withthe true identity of the Batman.
5778	5780	I'm sorry about Rachel.
5782	5787	The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,but that you won't accept medication.
5788	5790	That you're refusing to...
5790	5792	...accept skin grafts.
5792	5794	Remember that name...
5795	5797	...you all had for me...
5797	5800	...when I was at Internal Affairs?
5802	5804	What was it, Gordon?
5804	5806	Harvey, I....
5806	5807	Say it.
5809	5810	Say it!
5818	5821	Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.
5822	5826	Why should I hide who I am?
5827	5829	I know you tried to warn me.
5830	5831	I'm sorry.
5831	5834	Wuertz picked you up.Was he working for them?
5836	5838	Do you know who picked up Rachel?
5839	5842	Harvey, I need to knowwhich of my men I can trust.
5842	5844	Why would you listen to me now?
5846	5847	I'm sorry, Harvey.
5850	5851	No.
5852	5854	No, you're not.
5855	5856	Not yet.
5861	5864	This craziness, it's too much.
5864	5867	You should've thought about thatbefore you let the clown out of the box.
5867	5869	You want him?
5871	5873	I can tell youwhere he'll be this afternoon.
5881	5883	Not so crazy as you look.
5883	5887	I told you, I'm a man of my word.
5890	5891	Where is the Italian?
5891	5894	All tactical units will convergeon the location in 20 minutes.
5895	5898	I want auxiliary units to coverall possible getaway routes.
5899	5900	Please.
5900	5903	Joker-man, what you dowith all your money?
5904	5906	You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.
5906	5908	I enjoy...
5908	5909	...dynamite...
5910	5911	...and gunpowder...
5912	5914	...and gasoline.
5915	5917	-What the--?-Ah, ah, ah.
5919	5922	And you know the thingthat they have in common?
5922	5924	They're cheap.
5924	5926	I wanna know how much they are payingyou to say who Batman really is?
5926	5930	This is our chance. I want Lau alive.The Joker, either way.
5930	5932	Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.
5932	5933	Let's take the next caller.
5933	5935	Harvey Dent didn't wannagive in to this maniac.
5936	5937	You think you know better than him?
5937	5940	I think that if we could talk to Denttoday, he may feel differently.
5940	5944	And we wish him a speedy recovery.Because God knows, we need him now.
5945	5947	You said you were a man of your word.
5947	5949	Oh, I am.
5951	5953	I'm only burning my half.
5954	5956	All you care about is money.
5957	5960	This town deservesa better class of criminal...
5960	5962	...and I'm gonna give it to them.
5963	5965	Tell your men they work for me now.
5966	5968	This is my city.
5968	5971	They won't work for a freak.
5971	5973	"Freak."
5973	5975	Why don't wecut you up into little pieces...
5975	5977	...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?
5977	5980	And then we'll see how loyala hungry dog really is.
5982	5984	It's not about money...
5984	5987	...it's about sending a message.
5988	5990	Everything burns.
5993	5995	-Who is this?I had a vision...
5995	5997	...of a world without Batman.
5998	6000	The Mob ground out a little profit...
6000	6004	...and the police tried to shut them downone block at a time.
6004	6007	And it was so boring.
6007	6009	I've had a change of heart.
6009	6012	I don't want Mr. Reesespoiling everything...
6012	6016	...but why should I have all the fun?Let's give someone else a chance.
6017	6021	If Coleman Reeseisn't dead in 60 minutes...
6021	6023	...then I blow up a hospital.
6024	6025	I want you to call in every officer.
6025	6028	Tell them to head to their nearesthospital and start evac and search.
6029	6031	Call the transit authority,school board, prisons.
6031	6032	Get every available bus down to a hospital.
6033	6037	The priority is Gotham General. Wheeleverybody out of that place right now.
6037	6039	You, you and you, you come with me.
6039	6041	-Where are we going, sir?-To get Reese.
6041	6044	I need you plugged in, checkingGordon's men and their families.
6044	6046	-Looking for?-Hospital admissions.
6046	6048	Will you be wanting the Batpod, Sir?
6048	6050	In the middle of the day, Alfred?Not very subtle.
6050	6051	The Lamborghini, then.
6052	6053	Much more subtle.
6067	6069	Excuse me. Let me through.Excuse me. Okay.
6069	6073	Sir, could you help, please?
6073	6074	I'm gonna find a bus for him.
6076	6078	Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...
6078	6080	...an ordinary citizenwould try to kill this man?
6085	6087	Sir. Commissioner.
6089	6091	Get the cars around the back!
6093	6095	Go. Keep rolling, Sam.
6100	6102	I see O'Brien and Richards.
6103	6106	No immediate family memberadmitted to a Gotham hospital.
6107	6111	They're trying to kill me.-Well, maybe Batman can save you.
6123	6126	Davis, they got space. Bring him out.
6127	6129	Davis.
6134	6136	I saw Burns and Zachary.
6136	6138	Nothing on them.
6138	6139	And a patrolman I don't know.
6140	6142	Okay, so, what now?
6143	6145	What do we do now?Where are we going?
6148	6149	Send the information to Gordon.
6157	6158	Get out of here.
6160	6162	Davis.
6165	6167	Ma'am, we're gonna have tomove him now.
6179	6181	It's Berg, isn't it?-Commissioner.
6182	6183	You okay, son?
6201	6202	Hi.
6207	6208	You know...
6209	6212	...I don't want there to beany hard feelings between us, Harvey.
6212	6215	-When you and---Rachel!
6215	6218	--Rachel were being abducted...
6218	6221	...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.
6221	6223	I didn't rig those charges.
6223	6225	Your men, your plan.
6226	6228	Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
6228	6231	You know what I am?I'm a dog chasing cars.
6232	6234	I wouldn't know what to do with oneif I caught it.
6234	6237	You know? I just do things.
6237	6241	The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.
6241	6243	Gordon's got plans.
6243	6246	You know, they're schemers.
6246	6250	Schemers trying to controltheir little worlds.
6250	6252	I'm not a schemer.
6252	6253	I try to show the schemers...
6254	6259	...how pathetic their attemptsto control things really are.
6260	6262	So when I say-- Ah. Come here.
6263	6266	When I say that you and your girlfriendwas nothing personal...
6268	6270	...you know that I'm telling the truth.
6272	6275	-I'm gonna need your weapon.-What?
6279	6280	Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?
6281	6283	Yeah, that would be why.
6283	6286	It's the schemersthat put you where you are.
6287	6290	You were a schemer, you had plans...
6290	6293	...and look where that got you.
6303	6305	The Police, of course,are taking every possible precaution...
6305	6307	...and urging everyone not totake matters into their hands.
6307	6310	I just did what I do best.
6310	6314	I took your little plan,I turned it on itself.
6314	6319	Look what I did to this city with a fewdrums of gas and a couple of bullets.
6319	6322	Hm? You know...You know what I noticed?
6322	6326	Nobody panics whenthings go "according to plan."
6326	6327	Even if the plan is horrifying.
6328	6333	If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,a gangbanger will get shot...
6333	6336	...or a truckload of soldierswill be blowing up...
6337	6338	...nobody panics.
6338	6341	Because it's all part of the plan.
6342	6346	But when I say thatone little old mayor will die...
6346	6349	...well, then, everyone loses their minds.
6352	6355	Introduce a little anarchy...
6356	6358	...upset the established order...
6358	6363	...and everything becomes chaos.
6364	6367	I'm an agent of chaos.
6367	6370	Oh, and you know the thingabout chaos?
6372	6373	It's fair.
6382	6385	-You live.-Mm-hm.
6386	6387	You die.
6387	6389	Mmm. Now we're talking.
6398	6400	Mr. Reese.
6417	6419	That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?
6419	6422	-That was a very brave thing you did.-Trying to catch the light?
6423	6425	-You weren't protecting the van?-Why? Who's in it?
6430	6432	Don't you thinkI should go to the hospital?
6433	6435	You don't watch a whole lot of news,do you, Mr. Wayne?
6498	6500	Southeast.
6500	6503	It's Gotham General.
6503	6505	-Did you clear the building?Yeah.
6508	6509	We must knowhow many were inside.
6510	6511	You have patient lists, roll call.
6511	6513	Right now we're showing50 people missing. One bus.
6513	6516	All these others buses were heading off toother hospitals. My guess is we missed one.
6517	6519	Yeah? Well, what's your guessabout where Harvey Dent is?
6519	6523	Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.Anybody asks, we got him out.
6526	6528	Get me the mayor's office on the line.
6529	6531	We're gonna need the National Guard.
6531	6532	--people are still missing...
6533	6534	...including GCN's own Mike Engel.
6534	6537	I'm now being told that we're cutting toa video GCN has just received.
6537	6539	I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.
6539	6543	What does it take to make youpeople wanna join in?
6543	6545	You failed to kill the lawyer.I've gotta get you off the bench...
6545	6547	-...and into the game.Bench. Game.
6549	6551	Come nightfall, this city is mine.Mine.
6551	6554	-And anyone left here plays by my rules.-Rules.
6554	6558	Mr. Fox? Security is showinga break-in at the R&D Department.
6558	6560	If you don't wanna be in the game...
6560	6561	-...get out now.-Get out now.
6563	6566	But the bridge-and-tunnel crowdare sure in for a surprise.
6567	6568	Ha-ha, ha-ha.
6600	6602	Gotham P.D. has shut down...-Sweet Jesus.
6602	6604	-...the bridges and tunnels across the area.
6604	6608	Shouldn't you be out there,you know, doing something?
6608	6610	It's my day off.
6610	6612	I gotta take a leak.
6612	6614	Keep an eye out for me, will you?
6620	6621	Now what?You need someone to shake it for you?
6622	6623	Hello.
6624	6625	Dent.
6625	6628	Jesus. I thought you was dead.
6628	6629	Half.
6635	6637	Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
6637	6639	-It must've been Maroni's men.-Shut up!
6640	6642	Are you telling methat you're gonna protect...
6643	6644	...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
6644	6646	I don't know, he never told me.
6646	6649	Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn'tknow what they were gonna do to you.
6651	6652	That's funny...
6654	6656	...because I don't knowwhat's gonna happen to you either.
6660	6662	Beautiful, isn't it?
6663	6664	Beautiful.
6665	6666	Unethical.
6667	6668	Dangerous.
6669	6672	You've turned every cell phonein Gotham into a microphone.
6672	6674	And a high-frequency generator-receiver.
6675	6679	You took my sonar conceptand applied it to every phone in the city.
6680	6684	With half the city feeding you sonar,you can image all of Gotham.
6686	6687	This is wrong.
6687	6689	I've gotta find this man, Lucius.
6691	6692	At what cost?
6693	6695	The database is null-key encrypted.
6695	6698	It can only be accessed by one person.
6699	6701	This is too much power for one person.
6701	6703	That's why I gave it to you.
6704	6705	Only you can use it.
6705	6709	Spying on 30 million peopleisn't part of my job description.
6711	6714	This is an audio sample. If he talkswithin range of any phone in the city...
6714	6716	...you can triangulate his position.
6717	6719	I'll help you this one time.
6720	6721	But consider this my resignation.
6722	6726	As long as this machine isat Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.
6727	6729	When you're finished...
6729	6730	...type in your name.
6739	6742	Well, my officers are going overevery inch of the tunnels and bridges...
6742	6745	...but with the Joker's threat,they're not an option.
6745	6748	-And land routes east?-Backed up for hours.
6748	6751	Which leaves the ferrieswith 30,000 ready to board.
6751	6754	Plus, I wanna use the ferries so I canget some of those prisoners off the island.
6755	6757	The men you and dent put away?Those aren't people I'm worried about.
6758	6760	You should be.Whatever the Joker's planning...
6760	6762	...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
6762	6764	I wanna get them out of here.
6765	6767	So where is Harvey?
6767	6770	-We haven't found him.-Oh, Jesus.
6774	6776	How long can you keep this quiet?
6789	6792	Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
6793	6795	Going to join your wife?
6798	6801	-You love her?-Yes.
6801	6804	You ever imagine what it would be liketo listen to her die?
6804	6806	Look, take it up with the Joker.
6806	6809	He killed your woman. He made you...
6809	6810	...like this.
6811	6814	The Joker's just a mad dog.
6814	6816	I want whoever let him off the leash.
6817	6820	I took care of Wuertz, but who isyour other man inside Gordon's unit?
6820	6823	Who picked up Rachel?Must have been someone she trusted.
6824	6826	Look, if I tell you...
6826	6827	...will you let me go?
6828	6829	Can't hurt your chances.
6832	6833	It was Ramirez.
6839	6842	-But you said---I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
6845	6847	You're a lucky man.
6851	6852	-But he's not.-Who?
6855	6856	Your driver.
6869	6870	Stand back.
6870	6872	Hey Man, that ain't right.We should be on that boat.
6873	6875	You wanna ride acrosswith them? Be my guest.
6897	6899	Sir, they've stopped their engines.
6899	6900	Right, get on the radio.
6900	6904	Tell them we'll come back and pickthem up once we dump the scumbags.
6904	6906	Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.
6908	6909	What the heck was that?
6911	6913	What the--?
6913	6916	Liberty, come in, please.This is Spirit. Come in.
6918	6920	Liberty, we have the same thing.We've lost both engines.
6920	6921	-Liberty, come in.Fox.
6921	6924	There's something going onon the ferries.
6925	6927	Get down to the engine room now.
6927	6929	Hey, buddy, what's happening?
6938	6941	Captain, we got a hundred barrelsdown there rigged to blow. And this.
6954	6955	Oh, my God.
6955	6957	Looks like some kind of detonator.
6957	6959	Why would they give usthe detonator to our own bomb?
6962	6964	Tonight, you're all gonna be...
6964	6965	...a part of a social experiment.
6969	6973	Through the magic of diesel fueland ammonium nitrate...
6973	6977	...I'm ready right nowto blow you all sky-high.
6977	6979	Liberty, come in, over.
6980	6981	It's dead.
6982	6986	If anyone attemptsto get off their boat, you all die.
6986	6988	I'm zeroing in.
6988	6992	Each of you has a remoteto blow up the other boat.
6992	6995	His voice is on the ferry...
6995	6997	...but it's not the source.
6999	7000	West.
7007	7009	-Gordon.I have the Joker's location.
7009	7010	Prewitt Building.
7011	7013	Assemble on the building opposite.
7014	7017	At midnight, I blow you all up.
7017	7022	If, however, one of you pressesthe button, I'll let that boat live.
7022	7024	So who's it gonna be?
7024	7027	Harvey Dent's most-wantedscumbag collection...
7027	7030	...or the sweet and innocent civilians?
7030	7033	You choose.
7033	7035	Oh, and you might wannadecide quickly...
7035	7039	...because the people on the other boatmay not be quite so noble.
7046	7047	Stay back.
7047	7051	Well, now, who are you to decide?We ought to talk this over, at least.
7051	7055	We don't all have to die.Those men had their chance.
7055	7059	-We are not going to talk about this.-Why aren't we talking about it?
7059	7062	They're talking over the same exactthing on the other boat.
7062	7064	-Let's put it to a vote.Yes!
7069	7072	-Hello?Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.
7072	7075	Jim needs you to pack upand put the kids in the car right away.
7075	7076	But the units outside....
7077	7078	Those cops can't be trusted.
7078	7081	Jim needs you away from themas soon as possible.
7081	7084	I'll call them off for 10 minutes,and you'll have to move fast.
7084	7088	-But where am I supposed to take them?-250 52nd Street.
7088	7090	Leave as soon asthe patrol car pulls out.
7090	7091	Okay.
7092	7093	She believe you?
7094	7096	It's because she trusts you...
7096	7097	...just like Rachel did.
7097	7099	-I didn't know---Didn't know what they were gonna do?
7099	7102	You're the second cop to say that to me.
7102	7104	What exactly did you thinkthey were gonna do?
7104	7107	They got me early on.My mother's hospital bills....
7107	7110	-Don't!-I'm sorry.
7110	7113	You live to fight another day, officer.
7116	7118	We found the missing hospital bus.
7118	7120	And we have a hostage situation.
7122	7124	It's a shooting gallery.
7124	7126	Why would he choose a spotwith such big windows?
7126	7128	We have clear shots on five clowns.
7128	7131	Snipers take them out,smash the windows, a team rappels in.
7131	7133	Team moves in by the stairwells.
7133	7135	Two, three casualties max.
7135	7137	-Let's do it.It's not that simple.
7137	7138	-With the Joker, it never is.
7138	7140	-What's simple is thatevery second we don't take in,
7140	7143	those people on the ferries get closerto blowing each other up--
7143	7145	-That won't happen.-Then he'll blow both of them up!
7145	7149	-We don't have time for paper ballots.-I want everybody to put their votes...
7149	7151	...on this piece of paper.
7152	7155	If anyone's got pens, pass it along.
7155	7159	Thank you. Anybody else? Comingthrough. Anybody else? Thank you.
7159	7162	We need to get these votes in quickly.
7162	7163	Come on.
7165	7167	What are you waiting for?Just push the button!
7167	7169	We're running out of time!
7170	7172	I need five minutes alone.
7172	7174	No! There's no time!
7174	7176	We have clear shots!
7176	7179	Dent is in there with them.We have to save Dent!
7179	7181	I have to save Dent.
7181	7182	Get ready.
7185	7187	Two minutes, then we breach.
7193	7194	Fox, I need picture.
7197	7199	-Hello?Jim, we're in trouble.
7200	7203	Okay, you got POV on alpha...
7204	7206	...omni on beta.
7207	7210	Looks like clowns and hostageson two floors.
7210	7213	There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.
7216	7218	Another SWAT team on the roof.
7220	7221	Line's clear.
7223	7225	-Barbara, calm down.-He has the kids!
7225	7229	Hello, Jim.-Harvey?
7229	7232	-Where's my family?-Where my family died.
7235	7237	Blue team, acquire the target.
7239	7241	Entry team, set your charge.
7256	7258	Fox, the SWATs aretargeting the wrong people.
7258	7260	The clowns are the hostages.
7260	7262	Red team, go! Red team, go!
7266	7267	Entry team, blow and go!
7271	7272	Don't move.
7273	7275	Take the shot.
7280	7282	Those SWATs are coming in hot.
7282	7284	Clowns, put down your guns.
7284	7287	Drop your weapons!On the ground, now!
7287	7290	Doctors, get down!Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap--
7313	7315	Freeze!
7315	7317	Stand down or you will be--
7320	7322	Look up.
7322	7325	See those bad guys on the floor above?
7325	7328	They're waiting to ambushthe SWAT team coming up the elevator.
7328	7329	Sixty seconds.
7337	7342	The tally is 140 against, 396 for.
7350	7352	So go ahead. Do it.
7352	7354	We're still here.
7355	7358	And that means they haven'tkilled us yet either.
7359	7361	Go, go, go!
7361	7363	Blue team, cover!
7366	7367	Uh-oh.
7368	7370	Trouble on the floor above.
7379	7380	Get down on the ground now!
7388	7391	Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.
7391	7393	We will shoot you. Drop the officer.
7393	7394	Release the officer right now.
7394	7396	Let him go now!On your knees!
7397	7399	We got him. He's out of the game.
7399	7401	Keep your hands in the air!Step away from the edge!
7409	7411	Halt!
7423	7425	Stay down!Don't move!
7425	7429	Be advised. Clowns are hostages,doctors are targets.
7435	7437	Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.
7437	7440	-Where's the detonator?-Go get him.
7453	7456	Put down your weapon!Don't move!
7486	7488	You don't wanna die...
7488	7491	...but you don't know how to take a life.
7491	7493	Give it to me.
7493	7497	These men will kill youand take it anyway.
7501	7503	No one wants to get their hands dirty.
7503	7506	Fine. I'll do it.
7508	7510	Those men on that boat?They made their choices.
7510	7513	They chose to murder and steal.
7513	7516	It doesn't make any sensefor us to have to die too.
7525	7527	All the old familiar places.
7533	7534	Stand by.
7544	7548	Red team, floor secure.Hostages are safe.
7548	7550	Give it to me.
7551	7555	You can tell them I took it by force.
7555	7560	Give it to me, and I'll do whatyou should've did 10 minutes ago.
7581	7584	We really should stop this fighting,otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.
7585	7586	There won't be any fireworks.
7587	7590	And here we go.
7628	7629	What were you trying to prove?
7630	7632	That deep down,everyone's as ugly as you?
7633	7634	You're alone.
7641	7646	Can't rely on anyone these days. Yougotta do everything yourself. Don't we?
7646	7649	That's okay. I came prepared.
7649	7653	It's a funny world we live in. Speaking ofwhich, you know how I got these scars?
7654	7656	No, but I know how you got these.
7673	7676	Oh, you.
7676	7679	You just couldn't let me go, could you?
7680	7684	This is what happenswhen an unstoppable force...
7684	7688	...meets an immovable object.
7689	7694	You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?
7694	7697	Huh? You won't kill me...
7697	7703	...out of some misplaced senseof self-righteousness.
7703	7706	And I won't kill you...
7707	7710	...because you're just too much fun.
7711	7715	I think you and I are destinedto do this forever.
7715	7717	You'll be in a padded cell forever.
7717	7719	Maybe we could share one.
7719	7721	You know,they'll be doubling up...
7721	7723	...the rate this city's inhabitantsare losing their minds.
7723	7726	This city just showed you...
7727	7731	...that it's full of peopleready to believe in good.
7731	7734	Until their spirit breaks completely.
7735	7739	Until they get a good lookat the real Harvey Dent...
7739	7742	...and all the heroic things he's done.
7744	7748	You didn't think I'd risk losing the battlefor Gotham's soul...
7749	7751	...in a fistfight with you?
7752	7753	No.
7754	7757	You need an ace in the hole.
7757	7759	Mine's Harvey.
7759	7761	What did you do?
7761	7764	I took Gotham's white knight...
7764	7767	...and I brought him down to our level.
7768	7771	It wasn't hard.See, madness, as you know...
7771	7774	...is like gravity.
7774	7776	All it takes is a little push.
7792	7794	Dent!
7814	7818	This is where they brought her,Gordon, after your men handed her over.
7819	7820	This is where she died.
7821	7823	I know, I was here...
7824	7826	-...trying to save her.-But you didn't.
7827	7828	-I couldn't.-Yes, you could've.
7829	7830	If you'd listened to me.
7830	7833	If you stood up against corruption...
7833	7835	...instead of doing your dealwith the devil.
7835	7837	I was trying to fight the Mob!
7837	7842	You wouldn't dare try to justify yourselfif you knew what I'd lost.
7843	7846	Have you ever had to talk to theperson you loved most...
7846	7850	...tell them it's gonna be all right,when you know it's not?
7852	7855	Well, you're about to knowwhat that feels like, Gordon.
7856	7860	Then you can look me in the eyeand tell me you're sorry.
7861	7865	-You're not going to hurt my family.-No.
7865	7868	Just the person you love most.
7875	7878	So is it your wife?
7879	7881	Put the gun down, Harvey.
7881	7883	Harvey, put down the gun.
7883	7886	Please. Please, Harvey. Please.
7888	7889	Oh, goddamn it.
7889	7891	Will you stop pointing that gunat my family?
7892	7893	No!-We have a winner.
7893	7895	No, Jim, stop him!
7895	7897	Harvey.Don't let him--
7897	7898	Harvey!
7900	7901	I'm sorry!
7903	7904	For everything.
7907	7909	Please don't hurt my son.
7919	7920	You brought your cops?
7920	7923	All they know is there's a situation.
7923	7926	They don't know who or what.They're just creating a perimeter.
7926	7929	You think I wanna escape from this?
7929	7932	There is no escape from this.
7932	7934	You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.
7936	7939	It's not about what I want,it's about what's fair!
7940	7944	You thought we could be decent menin an indecent time.
7946	7947	But you were wrong.
7948	7952	The world is cruel. And the only moralityin a cruel world...
7953	7954	...is chance.
7955	7956	Unbiased.
7956	7958	Unprejudiced.
7959	7960	Fair.
7960	7962	His son's got the same chance she had.
7963	7964	Fifty-fifty.
7964	7968	What happened to Rachel wasn'tchance. We decided to act.
7968	7969	We three.
7969	7973	Then why was it me who wasthe only one who lost everything?
7975	7978	-It wasn't.-The Joker chose me.
7978	7980	Because you were the best of us.
7980	7985	He wanted to prove thateven someone as good as you...
7985	7987	...could fall.
7987	7988	And he was right.
7989	7991	You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.
7991	7994	So point it at the people responsible.
7995	7996	Fair enough.
8000	8001	You first.
8013	8015	My turn.
8022	8024	Harvey, you're right.
8025	8027	Rachel's death was my fault.
8030	8032	Please don't punish the boy.
8034	8037	-Please, punish me.-I'm about to.
8038	8040	Tell your boyhe's gonna be all right, Gordon.
8041	8042	Lie...
8043	8044	...like I lied.
8048	8049	It's going to be all right, son.
8056	8056	No!
8086	8089	Dad? Daddy, is he okay?
8104	8107	-Thank you.-You don't have to thank me.
8107	8109	Yes, I do.
8113	8114	The Joker won.
8117	8119	Harvey's prosecution,everything he fought for...
8120	8121	...undone.
8122	8127	Whatever chance you gave us at fixingour city dies with Harvey's reputation.
8127	8128	We bet it all on him.
8129	8132	The Joker took the best of usand tore him down.
8133	8134	People will lose hope.
8134	8136	They won't.
8138	8140	They must never know what he did.
8140	8142	Five dead.
8142	8143	Two of them cops.
8144	8146	-You can't sweep that---No.
8151	8153	But the Joker cannot win.
8158	8161	Gotham needs its true hero.
8167	8170	-No.-You either die a hero...
8171	8175	...or you live long enoughto see yourself become the villain.
8175	8177	I can do those things...
8177	8180	...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.
8183	8186	I killed those people.That's what I can be.
8186	8188	No, no, you can't. You're not.
8188	8190	I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
8192	8193	Call it in.
8196	8198	A hero.
8198	8201	Not the hero we deserved,but the hero we needed.
8202	8204	Nothing less than a knight...
8205	8206	...shining.
8207	8208	They'll hunt you.
8209	8210	You'll hunt me.
8211	8213	You'll condemn me.
8213	8216	Set the dogs on me.
8219	8221	Because that's what needs to happen.
8223	8224	Because sometimes...
8225	8227	...the truth isn't good enough.
8227	8230	Sometimes people deserve more.
8233	8237	Sometimes people deserveto have their faith rewarded.
8254	8256	Batman.
8258	8259	Batman!
8260	8262	Why's he running, Dad?
8263	8264	Because we have to chase him.
8265	8267	Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!
8273	8275	He didn't do anything wrong.
8277	8283	Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,but not the one it needs right now.
8284	8285	So we'll hunt him...
8288	8290	...because he can take it.
8292	8295	Because he's not our hero.
8302	8303	He's a silent guardian...
8304	8306	...a watchful protector.
8309	8310	A Dark Knight.
