293	295	Go inside.
297	299	Hurry up.
299	301	This way.
307	309	Hurry up.
321	324	Yeah, this'll do.Which one are you gonna have?
324	326	- I...- No, that's mine.
326	328	Alllz hup!
365	367	How far are the trees, Danny?
368	371	Over 200 feet.
371	373	Yeah, I'd say 300.
373	375	Long ways to dig.
375	379	We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.I wish Big X were here.
380	382	Willie, you think X got away?
382	384	He'd have sent us wordsomehow if he had.
384	388	- Gestapo, you think?- Either that or he's dead.
404	406	- Group Captain Ramsey?- Yes.
406	410	I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.Will you accompany me, please?
411	413	- I'll look after your gear, sir.- Right.
425	427	Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
428	430	Good morning, Group Captain.
431	436	I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.Since you're senior British officer,
436	440	you are to be liaison betweenthe prisoners and the colonel.
441	444	He wishes to make clear to youcertain matters of...
445	447	the word is "policy"?
447	448	Yes.
448	450	Thank you.
464	466	Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
467	470	I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.
479	482	Group Captain Ramsey,in the past four years
482	485	the Reich has been forced to spendan enormous amount of time,
485	487	energy, manpower and equipment
487	491	hunting down escapingprisoner-of-war officers.
491	494	At least it's rather niceto know you're wanted, isn't it?
494	500	For us it's not a matter for levity.There will be no escapes from this camp.
500	504	Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn dutyof all officers to try to escape.
504	506	If they can't, it is their dutyto cause the enemy
507	509	to use an inordinate numberof troops to guard them
510	513	and their sworn duty to harassthe enemy to the best of their ability.
514	516	Yes, I know.
516	519	The men under your authorityhave been most successful.
520	522	This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.
523	527	Caught in the North Sea, escaped,recaptured, escaped, recaptured.
527	530	Archibald "Archie" Ives:11 escape attempts.
531	534	Even tried to jumpout of the truck coming here.
534	536	Dickes, William.
536	539	Known to have participatedin digging of 11 escape tunnels.
539	542	Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.
542	545	MacDonald: nine.Hendley, the American: five.
545	549	Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.The list is almost endless.
549	553	One man here has made17 attempted escapes.
553	555	Group Captain, this is close to insanity.
555	558	- Quite.- And it must stop!
558	562	Colonel, do you expect officersto forget their duty?
565	567	No.
568	572	It is because we expect the oppositethat we have brought you here.
573	575	This is a new camp.
576	579	It has been builtto hold you and your men.
579	584	It is organised to incorporate allwe have learned of security measures.
584	588	And in me, you will not bedealing with a common jailer,
588	591	but with a staff officerpersonally selected for the task
592	594	by the Luftwaffe high command.
595	600	We have in effect putall our rotten eggs in one basket,
600	603	and we intend to watchthis basket carefully.
604	605	Very wise.
609	612	You will not be denied the usual facilities.
612	617	Sports, a library, a recreation hall,
618	621	and for gardening we will give you tools.
621	624	We trust you to use them for gardening.
624	627	Devote your energies to these things.
627	630	Give up your hopelessattempts to escape.
631	633	And, with intelligent cooperation,
634	636	we may all sit out the war
638	641	as comfortably as possible.
658	661	- What do you do here by the truck?- I'm stealing tools.
661	665	- For stealing tools, cooler.- I was only kidding.
665	667	- Oh, you're American.- Yes, and you're a German.
667	670	Of course.Why do you come to Germany?
671	674	- Why fight for England, your enemy?- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?
674	678	- In 1812 they burned your capital.- That's propaganda.
678	681	It's in the history books. I read it.
682	684	Now go away from here.If you steal tools, cooler.
685	686	Yeah. No tools.
692	694	Hey, Virgil.
694	696	Hey, did you see the cooler?
697	698	Boy, is it ever a big one!
698	701	- I think they expect a lot of business.- Yeah.
701	705	Those two guys who were with us inthe old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.
706	709	- You think the goons left 'em behind?- I guess.
709	712	What were their names?It was Jackson and...
713	715	- And Dexter.- Dexter. That's right.
715	718	I'm gonna see who else I can find.I'll see you later.
743	745	Hey, Danny. Who are they?
745	748	Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.
748	751	- They keep them here?- No, they take them out.
754	756	Willie, cigarettes.
776	780	Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Couldyou put on a brief show for the goons?
780	782	Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?
783	785	- Choir practice?- Knuckles, eh?
785	788	- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.- Give him the coat.
790	793	- What are you doing with my coat, mate?- What? It's mine!
793	795	Are you pushing me?
795	797	That's mine, you son of a...
827	830	Stop it! Stop this nonsense!
830	834	It's all right, mate. We're justhaving a friendly little argument.
834	837	- No more fighting. No more!- All right.
837	838	- Back in your huts.- Yes, sir.
839	841	You, too!
842	844	Get away! Get back in your huts!
847	848	Go on!
880	884	Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's onlyone other American in the whole camp.
884	886	Some guy named Hendleyin the RAF Eagle squadron.
887	889	Hey, you got something goin' already?
889	893	See the way the goonsgot those towers placed?
893	896	- There's a blind spot through the middle.- A blind spot?
896	899	A guy could stand at that wireand not be seen by either tower.
899	902	They'd never see me, especially at night.
902	906	- You're crazy.- You think so? Let's find out right now.
923	926	Now, the next step's a little tricky.
926	930	- You're not goin' out there?- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.
932	935	I think I'll take a little walk.
977	979	- Danny, you speak Russian?- Only one sentence.
980	982	Let me have it, mate.
989	992	- What's it mean?- I love you.
992	995	I love you? What bloody good is that?
995	998	I don't know.I wasn't going to use it myself.
1022	1024	Out. Out!
1026	1029	- Your friend, yes?- Huh?
1030	1033	And who vouches for you,Lieutenant Willinski?
1033	1035	Get out, Sedgwick.
1072	1074	Hold it, hold it!
1078	1080	- Your name?- Ives.
1081	1083	Ives.
1083	1087	Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.
1087	1090	The photograph doesn't do you justice.
1090	1093	I'd like to see one of youunder similar circumstances.
1118	1121	I will not take action against you now.
1121	1126	This is the first day here and there hasbeen much stupidity and carelessness...
1127	1128	on both sides.
1146	1148	Hey! Get out!
1152	1154	Don't shoot!
1156	1159	You fool! To cross the wire is death!
1159	1162	- What wire?- This wire! The warning wire!
1163	1166	It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.You know that.
1166	1169	But my baseball rolled over there.How am I gonna get my baseball?
1169	1172	- You first ask permission.- Oh, OK.
1174	1178	- Gettin' my baseball.- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!
1178	1180	- OK.- You stay there!
1180	1183	Out of the way. Out.
1187	1189	What are you doingover here by the wire?
1189	1192	Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...
1204	1207	- What were you doing by the wire?- Well, like I told Max...
1208	1212	I was trying to cut my way throughyour wire, because I wanna get out.
1219	1221	Do you speak German?
1222	1224	Wire cutters.
1226	1230	I have had the pleasure of knowing quitea number of British officers in this war.
1231	1234	And I flatter myselfthat we understand one another.
1240	1243	You are the first American officerI have met. Hilts, isn't it?
1243	1245	Captain Hilts, actually.
1245	1247	- 17 escape attempts.- 18, sir.
1247	1250	- Tunnel man, engineer.- Flier.
1250	1255	I suppose what's calledin the American army a "hotshot pilot".
1255	1257	Unfortunately,you were shot down anyway.
1257	1260	So we are both groundedfor the duration of the war.
1260	1263	Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.
1267	1271	- You have other plans?- I haven't seen Berlin yet.
1271	1274	I plan on doing so before the war's over.
1274	1277	Are all American officers so ill-mannered?
1277	1280	About 99 per cent.
1280	1283	Perhaps while you are with us,you will have a chance to learn some.
1284	1286	10 days isolation, Hilts.
1286	1289	- Captain Hilts.- 20 days.
1289	1291	Right.
1292	1295	Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?
1295	1298	Cooler.
1306	1308	- Name?- Ives.
1308	1310	Flying Officer Ives.
1310	1312	Cooler. 20 days.
1316	1318	- Cooler, Ives.- Pleasure.
1417	1419	- Hilts.- Yeah?
1419	1422	What did you do in the States?Play baseball?
1422	1424	No, I was in college.
1425	1427	- Say, Ives.- Aye?
1428	1432	- How many escapes have you tried?- Four over, seven under.
1434	1437	- Tunnel man, huh?- Sure, I am that.
1439	1441	How tall are you, Ives?
1441	1443	Five feet four. Why?
1444	1446	Oh, just wondering.
1447	1451	What did you do in college?Study physical education?
1451	1455	Chemical engineering.Did a little bike riding, though.
1455	1456	Bicycles?
1457	1462	Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.Picked up a buck here and there.
1462	1466	- Helped pay my tuition.- I did a wee bit of racing myself.
1466	1468	- In Scotland.- Bikes?
1468	1471	No, horse racing. Jockey.
1473	1475	Jockey.
1478	1479	Jockey.
1484	1485	Hilts?
1487	1488	Are you there, Hilts?
1491	1492	Yeah, I'm here.
1492	1495	Don't you have them in the States?Jockeys?
1496	1497	Sure.
1498	1503	They were the days. Saturday nightsin towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.
1504	1506	You had to fight off the birds.
1506	1508	You know, birds.
1508	1510	Girls, man. Girls.
1512	1513	Do you not have them in the States?
1516	1518	Hilts?
1518	1520	Are you there, Hilts?
1521	1522	Ives.
1525	1527	What?
1527	1532	You know the kind of clay and gravelwe got here in the compound?
1532	1535	How many feet do you thinkyou could get through in eight hours?
1535	1540	I could go through this dirt herelike the bit on an end of an auger.
1540	1544	But you know it's not the digging.It's the shoring up with wood
1544	1547	and getting the dirt out -that's what you've to worry about.
1547	1550	No, it isn't, Ives.You don't have to worry about that.
1550	1553	How are you going to get the dirt out?
1553	1557	- What do they call a mole in Scotland?- A mole.
1558	1560	Aye.
1561	1564	Well, what do you think?
1565	1568	I must say,it's an interesting first 20 minutes.
1568	1570	I'd say we made fools of ourselves.
1570	1573	As the sergeant out there says,this is only the first day.
1591	1593	Eric.
1593	1597	Don't take too much notice.The goons may not know who he is.
1597	1600	- I'll pass the word.- I'll tell the old man.
1602	1604	He has arrived.
1612	1616	The prisoner Bartlett is dischargedinto your custody, Colonel Von Luger.
1626	1628	I suggest this prisoner be kept
1628	1632	under the strictestsecurity confinement permanently.
1632	1635	Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.
1636	1638	We have reason to believehe is the leader
1638	1641	of numerous criminal escape attempts.
1642	1646	Squadron Leader Bartletthas been three months in your care,
1646	1650	and the Gestapo has only"reason to believe"?
1650	1654	If he once more falls into our hands,he will not be so lucky.
1654	1659	Air-force officer prisoners arethe responsibility of the Luftwaffe,
1659	1661	not the SS,
1662	1664	or the Gestapo.
1665	1667	At present, yes, Herr Oberst.
1667	1671	That is why he is returnedfor the moment to your care.
1671	1674	Of course, if the Luftwaffeis not up to the task,
1674	1677	the prisoners will find themselvestotally in our charge.
1677	1681	We regretfully are notso professionally understanding.
1685	1688	Squadron Leader Bartlett,
1688	1693	if you escape again and be caught,you will be shot.
1707	1709	Herr Kuhn.
1752	1753	- Eric.- Hello, Roger.
1754	1756	- They dumped you here, too.- What's this one like?
1756	1758	Well, it's new.
1759	1762	Here. Let's find you a bed.
1762	1764	Thanks.
1780	1782	Come in.
1784	1786	- Hello, Roger.- Hello, sir.
1787	1790	- I'll put your bag in your room.- Thanks, Eric.
1791	1793	- How are you?- As well as can be expected.
1794	1797	The fellows wanted to put upa welcome committee, but that's for later.
1797	1802	- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.- A lot of old friends here.
1802	1805	- How long have you been here, sir?- Arrived today.
1805	1807	New camp, expert guards, the elite.
1808	1810	You met the commandant?
1811	1813	Yes, I did.
1814	1817	What were the Gestapoand the SS doing with you?
1817	1819	They wanted to find outwho helped me to the border.
1820	1821	Who else is here? Cavendish?
1822	1824	- Nimmo and Sorren?- Griffith, Haynes.
1824	1826	- Blythe?- Yes.
1827	1830	Almost the whole X organisation.
1830	1835	Almost. They cleaned out all the othercamps and dumped us in this one.
1835	1838	As Von Luger put it:"All the rotten eggs in one basket. "
1840	1842	There's madness in their method.
1842	1844	What about Tommy Bristol?
1844	1847	No, but there's an American - Hendley.
1848	1850	Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?
1851	1854	- MacDonald says he's the best.- Good.
1855	1859	Last of the tea untilthe Red Cross gets through again.
1859	1861	I scrounged this from Sedgwick.
1866	1869	Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?
1869	1872	Not nearly as roughas I now intend to give them.
1873	1878	Roger, personal revenge must bekept out of what we have to do here.
1878	1880	Too many lives are at stake.
1883	1886	What my personal feelings areis of no importance.
1887	1891	You appointed me Big X,and it's my duty to harass,
1891	1893	confound and confuse the enemyto the best of my ability.
1894	1897	- That's true.- That's what I intend to do.
1898	1902	I'm gonna cause such a terrible stinkin this Third Reich of theirs
1902	1907	that thousands of troops'll betied up here looking after us.
1907	1908	How?
1908	1911	By putting more men out of this
1911	1914	perfect camp of theirsthan have ever escaped before.
1914	1919	Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.Scatter them all over Germany.
1919	1922	- Think that's possible?- The men are here to do it.
1922	1927	The goons have put every escape artistin Germany here. You said so yourself.
1927	1929	Have you thought of what it might cost?
1932	1936	I've thought of the humiliationif we just tamely submit,
1936	1939	knuckle under and crawl.
1939	1942	Surely you don't advocate that,do you, sir?
1942	1945	I have to point outone thing to you, Roger.
1945	1948	No matter how unsatisfactorythis camp may be,
1948	1951	the high command have left usin the hands of the Luftwaffe,
1951	1953	not the Gestapo and the SS.
1955	1959	Look, sir, you talk aboutthe high command of the Luftwaffe,
1959	1961	then the SS and the Gestapo.
1961	1965	To me they're the same.We're fighting the bloody lot.
1965	1967	There's only one way to put it, sir.
1967	1971	They are the common enemies ofeveryone who believes in freedom.
1971	1974	If they didn't approve of Hitler,why didn't they throw him out?
1974	1977	I have no argument with you, Roger.
1977	1981	As senior officer, I'm merelypointing out a pertinent fact.
1984	1987	When are you calling a meeting, X?
1995	1997	Tonight.
2008	2014	Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard theimmortal words of our new commandant.
2014	2017	"Devote your energiesto things other than escape
2017	2019	and sit out the waras comfortably as possible. "
2022	2025	Well, that's exactlywhat we're going to do.
2025	2028	We're going to devote our energiesto sports and gardening,
2028	2031	all the cultural pursuitsas far as they're concerned.
2031	2034	In fact, we're going toput the goons to sleep.
2035	2038	Meanwhile, we dig.
2039	2042	Now, even a superficial lookat the compound
2042	2046	shows us that huts 104 and 5are closest to the woods.
2046	2048	The first tunnel goes out from 105,
2048	2051	directly eastunder the cooler and the wire.
2051	2053	But that's over 300 feet, Roger.
2054	2057	- Did you make a survey, Dennis?- Only a temporary one, sir.
2057	2060	- I make it just over 335 feet.- Tell me when you've got an exact one.
2060	2064	Willie, this time we'll dig straight down30 feet before we go horizontal.
2064	2068	That'll rule out any questionof sound detection or probing.
2068	2071	All right, Roger,but did you say the first tunnel?
2071	2074	I did. There'll be three.
2076	2080	We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.Tom goes out directly east from 104.
2080	2085	Dick goes north from the kitchen, andHarry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.
2087	2090	If the goons find one,we'll move into the other.
2090	2094	How many men do youplan to take out, Roger?
2094	2095	250.
2097	2101	There'll be no half measures this time.Identification papers for everyone.
2101	2104	And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.
2105	2107	- 250?- Mostly civilian clothes.
2107	2109	Yes, but...
2111	2112	OK, Roger.
2113	2117	Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,compasses for all the walkers.
2117	2120	- Timetables for every train.- Right, Roger.
2126	2129	- Sorry I'm late, Roger.- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
2129	2131	We're going to tunnel.
2132	2134	Splendid.
2135	2140	Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.
2140	2143	Sedgwick, manufacturer.Griff, as I said, tailor.
2143	2148	Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,of course, will take care of intelligence.
2148	2151	Hendley. We haven't met.
2151	2153	- Scrounger?- Right.
2154	2156	Dennis, maps and surveys.
2156	2161	Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?
2161	2166	Usual places. I hadn't anticipatedthree tunnels, but we'll manage.
2166	2170	Roger, who's going to handlesecurity for all this?
2170	2174	You are. I want a system of stoogescovering this compound
2174	2178	from front to back,checking every goon in and out.
2178	2182	I want a signal system so perfectthat if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet
2182	2187	of any of the huts in which we're working,we can shut down without a sign.
2188	2192	Well, I don't think there's much pointin discussing any more now.
2192	2197	I'll meet each of you on the exercisecircuit, and we'll pound out the details.
2199	2201	Nothing else, is there, Mac?
2201	2204	I shouldn't think so, Roger.
2229	2232	Oh, hello.
2232	2233	My name's Blythe.
2235	2236	Hendley.
2240	2243	- For birds.- I used to do a little hunting myself.
2243	2246	Oh, not hunting. Watching.
2247	2250	Oh, a bird watcher?
2250	2254	Yes, that's right.Watching them and drawing them.
2256	2259	I suppose you havebird watchers in the States?
2259	2261	Yes, we have some.
2263	2264	Tea?
2265	2267	I only drank tea once, in the hospital.
2269	2271	Where's your kit?
2271	2276	This is it. The rest was confiscatedin the last shakedown.
2276	2281	The goons didn't appreciatesome of my more personal items.
2284	2286	Such as.
2286	2290	- You're the scrounger.- Yes, that's right.
2290	2292	I'll need a camera.
2293	2296	- What kind?- A good one.
2296	2301	A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shuttershould do all right.
2304	2305	All right.
2306	2308	- And film, of course.- Oh, of course.
2310	2313	Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.
2314	2316	- Only one?- Two would be better.
2321	2323	I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.
2323	2327	I must have used thesewretched leaves about 20 times.
2327	2330	It's not that I mind so much.
2330	2332	Tea without milk is so uncivilised.
2333	2335	Yeah.
2335	2337	I'll get our wood.
2345	2347	Close up! Close up!
2355	2357	Close up!
2358	2360	Close up!
2360	2361	Close up!
2361	2365	- No me sprlchln the English.- Close up!
2389	2391	Splendid.
2404	2407	Blythe, what are you doing here?
2408	2411	I'm in Photographic AerialReconnaissance Interpretation.
2411	2415	Went for a joyride to see for myself.It's my own silly fault.
2415	2420	The aircraft bought it.Got shot down. Terrifying.
2421	2425	- No, I mean, what do you do here?- Here?
2428	2430	I'm the forger.
2449	2452	Forgers are installing themselvesin the recreation hut.
2452	2454	- Sedgwick?- I'm in 110.
2454	2458	- Griffith.- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.
2458	2460	109? Right.
2460	2464	I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willieand their trap team will be in 104.
2465	2469	I want to take a chance on the tunnelsand press ahead without any shoring-up.
2469	2472	We will need timber for the shaftsand the entrance chambers.
2472	2475	Hendley figuresthere are 36 empty bunks.
2475	2479	We can tear up 15 and move the menaround so the goons won't miss them.
2479	2481	The rest will comefrom strips off the wall.
2481	2484	- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?- Not yet.
2484	2487	He's working on some steelfor a pick that Danny needs.
2505	2508	Hey! What the hell is going on here?
2508	2511	Turn the water off! Get your hands away!
2512	2513	Get away!
2514	2517	Hey! What the hell's going on there?
2518	2520	Stop this nonsense!
2523	2525	Get away!
2525	2526	Turn the water off!
2526	2527	Somewhere!
2567	2573	In the stove, we keep fire burning always.The goons will not feel like moving it.
2573	2577	- Good.- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.
2577	2580	- We need new ones.- There's some in 113's washroom.
2580	2582	- Should match perfectly.- Good.
2591	2594	It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.
2596	2598	Not when you're organised, Mac.
2602	2604	- We're ready.- Big enough?
2605	2609	It's perfect. Right throughthe middle of the foundation.
2614	2616	Good luck to us, Danny.
2635	2637	Why 17?
2637	2640	This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.
2672	2674	All right?
2689	2691	It's good.
2700	2702	It's very good.
2740	2742	Get out! Get out!
2766	2769	You're not in your hut?What are you doing here?
2770	2770	Mopping up.
2775	2778	- And you?- Shower. I need a wash.
2782	2785	I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.
2789	2793	Put on warm clothes.You might be outside all night.
2842	2846	No. I vote no. Look, we've putthe goons to sleep exactly like you said.
2846	2850	But just one little thing like thisand we're up the creek without a paddle.
2850	2854	- Ives, sit down, won't you?- Hello, sir.
2854	2857	Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,Captain Hilts.
2857	2859	Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
2859	2863	I understand you twoare contemplating a blitz-out.
2863	2865	Where'd you hear that... sir?
2865	2869	MacDonald. It's Mac's jobto know everything that goes on.
2869	2872	We thought perhaps we might talk it over.
2872	2875	Why? It's only a two-man job.
2875	2878	Everybody in the camp is supposed toclear all escape attempts in advance
2879	2881	with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.
2881	2884	We don't necessarily want to interfere.
2884	2889	It's just that... well, what sort of blitzwere you contemplating?
2890	2893	We sneak out at night to a spotI found near the wire - a blind spot.
2893	2896	Then we dig down, take the dirt,spread it on top so it won't make a pile,
2897	2898	and then straight out.
2898	2902	Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digsin front, pushes the dirt behind him.
2902	2906	I stash it behind me, then we burrowthrough the dirt like a couple of moles.
2906	2911	By dawn we're under the wire, acrossthe open space, into the woods and gone.
2918	2919	Well...
2922	2924	When do you intend to try this?
2924	2927	- When do you intend to try it?- Oh, tonight.
2928	2932	Hilts, this may not be quitethe right time for this sort of thing.
2933	2936	Look, sir, I've been in the bagnearly three years now,
2936	2938	bloody close to being wire-happy.
2938	2941	It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.
2942	2944	It'll work. I know it will.
2953	2954	Good luck.
2954	2956	Thank you.
2958	2962	- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.
2962	2965	We shove it up and make air holesas we go along.
2965	2967	Good night, sir.
2973	2976	Now, why didn't anybodythink of that before?
2976	2979	It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.
2979	2982	But it'll bring every goonin the camp down on top of us.
2983	2985	I don't know.Perhaps we're being too clever.
2985	2987	If we stop all the breakouts,
2987	2991	it may only convince the goonsthat we must be tunnelling.
2991	2997	I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're goingto be in the cooler for an awful long time.
3042	3045	- Good, huh?- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.
3052	3055	- This is the dirt from the compound.- This is from the tunnel.
3062	3065	Wherever we put it,they're going to spot it a mile away.
3065	3068	Maybe we could put it under the huts.The dirt's dark there.
3068	3072	It's the first place the ferrets would look.I saw one measuring yesterday.
3072	3074	Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.
3074	3078	- There are 50 tons of it.- I was just thinking out loud.
3079	3082	If you must think,for God's sake, think clearly.
3083	3085	Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?
3086	3090	We can't destroy the dirtand we can't eat it.
3090	3093	The only thing left to do is camouflage it.
3093	3096	That's as far as my thinking takes me.
3097	3100	Didn't they teach youpromptness in the RN?
3100	3103	You'll never believe it,but I think I have the solution.
3103	3107	The problem is somehow to get rid ofthis tunnel dirt over the compound.
3107	3109	Well, of course.
3110	3112	Would you mind?
3122	3124	Now...
3125	3129	you fill these bagswith the dirt from the tunnel.
3129	3132	Then, wearing them inside your trousers,
3132	3135	you wander out into the compound
3135	3139	where you pull thesestrings in your pockets.
3140	3142	Out come the pins.
3145	3150	- Eric, it's good.- All you have to do is kick it in.
3150	3153	Unless you're a fool,the ferrets won't see a thing.
3153	3156	It's indecently brilliant.What do you think, Roger?
3156	3160	- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.- I already have. It works.
3162	3165	Mac, this is what we'll do.
3179	3182	- A little present from Tom, sir.- Thank you, Nimmo.
3191	3193	Nice garden you've got, sir.
3226	3228	All right. Let's look sharp.
3235	3236	That looks sharp.
3241	3243	Sir.
3246	3250	Please, gentlemen, continue.This is merely a routine inspection.
3265	3268	- Good morning, Squadron Leader.- Good morning, sir.
3268	3272	I am sorry the soil here isn'tbetter suited to your men's purpose.
3272	3274	We'll manage, sir.
3284	3288	I must say I am surprised withthe extent of this activity, Group Captain.
3288	3292	- Pleased, of course, but surprised.- Surprised, Colonel?
3292	3298	Fliers are gentlemen, not peasantsto dig in the earth. So I am surprised.
3298	3300	The English are keen on gardening.
3300	3304	Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?
3305	3307	You can't eat flowers, Colonel.
3310	3312	Good point.
3329	3332	I have the nasty feelinghe knows exactly what we're doing.
3332	3335	- Maybe he does.- You don't really think so, do you?
3335	3338	If he does, we'll find out soon enough.
3349	3351	- Morning, Bob.- Andy.
3352	3355	Here we are. Now, let's see.
3355	3358	Biscuits, two packets.
3358	3360	Coffee, two tins.
3360	3362	Bovril, one jar.
3362	3365	Cigarettes, six packets.
3365	3370	Strawberry jam, Sorren's.Black currant jam, Cavendish.
3370	3372	And marmalade, mine.
3372	3376	Danish butter, Von Luger's.I liberated it from his mess supplies.
3376	3381	Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.
3382	3385	That cleans out the gift foodfor the entire organisation.
3386	3389	Now, the first thing we needis the new form of travel permit.
3389	3392	The forgers have no ideawhat it looks like.
3392	3393	I'll see what I can do.
3393	3397	And, of course, any otheridentity cards, personal papers,
3397	3399	documents you can put your hands on.
3399	3402	- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.- Right.
3402	3404	Good luck.
3412	3416	O come all ye faithful
3416	3419	Joyful and triumphant
3419	3421	O come ye
3421	3427	O come ye to Bethlehem
3427	3430	Come and behold Him
3431	3434	Born the King of Angels
3434	3437	O come let us adore Him
3438	3441	O come let us adore Him
3441	3446	O come let us adore Him
3446	3448	Louis, where the hell is the air pump?
3449	3450	Patience is a virtue, Roger.
3451	3454	Yes, I know, but the diggerscan only work when the trap's open,
3454	3457	and this is holding us up very badly.
3459	3461	- Is it finished?- Of course.
3461	3464	- Why isn't it in?- Working on the air ducts now.
3464	3467	- Well, when will they be finished?- One or two days.
3468	3470	- Does it work?- Of course it works.
3471	3474	- Will it give us enough air?- As much as you'll need.
3475	3476	Mac.
3477	3478	Excellent.
3479	3482	Have it in by tomorrow night.
3483	3486	Christ the Lord
3493	3495	- Got a light?- Yeah.
3498	3500	Thanks.
3500	3502	- It's pretty, isn't it?- Yes.
3510	3513	Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?
3515	3519	I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.Thank you.
3519	3522	You probably havea couple of roommates, huh?
3523	3528	- Beautiful day.- Yes, but I think it might rain later.
3528	3529	No, no.
3529	3532	Red sky in the morning,sailor takes warning.
3532	3535	Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
3535	3537	It was a red sky last night.
3537	3539	I never heard that before.
3539	3541	I learned it in the Boy Scouts.
3541	3544	- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.- Really?
3544	3547	- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.- I had 20.
3548	3552	I was working on my 20th whenthe government abolished scouting
3552	3555	and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.
3559	3563	Werner, you think you'll stayin the army after the war?
3563	3566	No. I'm not a well man.
3566	3568	- And my teeth...- Your teeth?
3568	3570	Yes. I could tell youstories about my teeth
3570	3573	that would make your hair stand on end.
3573	3575	Our dentist here is a butcher.
3577	3579	But don't tell anyone I said so.
3580	3582	It's a soldier's right to complain.
3583	3585	Maybe in your army, but here?
3586	3590	One little criticism,and... to the Russian front.
3590	3594	Is that so? Terrible.
3595	3597	That's terrible.
3602	3604	Werner.
3607	3609	Why don't we go into my room?
3609	3612	I'd better not.If Strachwitz should see me...
3615	3617	I was just gonna make some coffee.
3620	3622	Real coffee.
3650	3653	Coffee, coffee, coffee.
3653	3655	Where is it?
3661	3664	My grandmother keepssending me this stuff.
3670	3672	Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.
3681	3683	Yeah. Keep it.
3683	3685	Nlin. I must go.
3685	3688	It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.
3688	3691	With you in the cooler,will we be friends? I must report this.
3691	3697	I don't understand you. Report what?That you and I were chatting in my room?
3697	3700	- I must go.- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.
3700	3703	I'll never be able to eat it all.I've got all I could eat.
3703	3706	I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.
3739	3743	And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,is the voice of the Nelles warbler.
3743	3747	Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -the masked shrike.
3747	3749	Kanius nubicus. The butcherbird.
3749	3753	The shrike impales his foeson the spikes of thorn bushes.
3753	3757	Not a very lovable character, you see.Let's have a look at the colouring.
3757	3760	Uniform black above, from head to tail.
3761	3766	A black rump, a black crown with a boldwhite flash, and a white line over the eye.
3766	3769	The shrike livesin lightly wooded country...
3769	3773	Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll finddrawing materials on the table.
3774	3778	The shrike lives in lightly woodedcountry, olive groves and gardens.
3778	3780	Well, Hendley, have youtaken to birds too now?
3780	3783	Yeah. Stick around.You might learn something.
3783	3786	I have better things to do than draw birds.
3787	3792	The voice is a monotonous successionof scratchy, complaining notes.
3792	3796	Now, let's have a good look at this bird.He's got a round shape...
3816	3820	An Urlaubsschlin. Permission tocross a frontier. Here's another one.
3820	3823	Which one's the forgery?
3824	3826	- That one.- That's right.
3826	3828	They both are.
3829	3832	What's holding us up now isthe new form of this travel permit.
3832	3835	- We've no idea what they look like.- Here's one.
3836	3839	And a military identity card.
3840	3841	And a...
3841	3843	- An Auswlis.- Yeah.
3843	3847	- Permission to be on Reich property.- A ticket to Oden.
3847	3851	What appears to be the ferretassignments for the next week.
3852	3854	You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.
3854	3858	- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.- Where did you get this?
3859	3861	It's on loan.
3863	3866	In order to getthe right amount of outfits, Roger,
3866	3869	I suggest that we workmainly from service uniforms.
3869	3873	I can do double-breasteds,single-breasteds,
3873	3876	and rather nice lounge suits.
3876	3879	Lapels. I can do quite a lotof things with those.
3879	3884	I can have them deep like thator high ones like that.
3885	3888	Here's one thatwe're working on right now.
3888	3891	Oh, yes. What about buttons?
3892	3897	Take a look at those.Here's one that I've finished, Roger.
3899	3905	And here's one that I dyedwith a bottle of blue ink.
3907	3910	It's rather good. What's up, Roger?
3910	3913	The goons'd have a field dayif they crashed in on this lot.
3913	3917	That's Sorren's department. Now, I'vestarted working on the other materials.
3917	3919	This blanket.
3920	3923	Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.
3923	3924	- Coats.- Yes.
3924	3927	I've got the chaps working on theseall over the compound.
3927	3930	Those battle dresses -I'm afraid they're a bit too short.
3930	3935	I'll have to get the chaps to make thoseinto some sort of workingman's outfits.
3935	3937	Blanket ticking.
3937	3942	Now, I've made these intorather nice little waistcoats.
3942	3946	- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.- Of course.
3946	3948	Just take a look at this, Roger.
3949	3954	Now, this blanket material, we scrapethis down until it's really smooth,
3954	3956	and then dye it with boot polish.
3956	3960	Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.I wish we had more of this.
3960	3963	- Where in God's name did you get these?- Hendley.
3963	3966	- Where did he get them?- I asked him that.
3966	3968	- What did he say?- "Don't ask. "
3969	3972	Let me show you some of the overcoatsI've been working on.
4002	4004	Good morning, Hilts.
4005	4008	Well, if you're here to find outif I'm going out again, I am.
4009	4011	- When?- 17 days. 7th of July.
4011	4013	- Dark of the moon.- Correct.
4013	4015	Is Ives going with you?
4015	4018	Yeah, if he wants to.
4018	4022	You know that Ives is close to cracking?
4023	4025	Yeah.
4026	4029	- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?- Safer.
4035	4036	Right.
4038	4042	It's possible for one man to get outthrough the wire, even get away,
4042	4048	but there are in fact a considerablenumber of people besides yourself
4048	4050	in this camp who are trying to escape.
4051	4053	I appreciate that.
4056	4058	Something's coming - I can feel it -
4058	4062	and it's coming right around the cornerat me, Squadron Leader.
4062	4064	- My name's Roger.- All right, Roger.
4064	4066	Yours is Virgil, isn't it?
4068	4070	Hilts. Just make it Hilts.
4071	4076	Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,
4077	4080	we have maps of Germany -general maps, that is.
4080	4084	We have all the information we needfor the escape routes out of Germany.
4084	4086	But what we do not have...
4086	4090	Is a clear idea of what's 500 yardsbeyond those trees.
4090	4093	We've tried every goon in the camp.No go.
4093	4097	We must know the exact positionof the local town.
4097	4100	We want to know wherewe hit the main roads.
4100	4104	Where the police stations are,where they've got their roadblocks.
4104	4108	And most important of all,we've got to know how to get from here
4108	4111	to the railway station.
4111	4114	No. Absolutely not.When I get through that wire,
4114	4117	I'm not gonna bemaking maps for you guys.
4117	4123	I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hearif they're shooting at me with howitzers.
4123	4126	- Understandable.- Completely.
4128	4131	I mean, I'd like to help, but...
4134	4137	Interesting idea.
4137	4140	- How many you taking out?- 250.
4143	4145	250?
4145	4147	Yeah.
4147	4149	You're crazy. You too.
4149	4153	250 guys just walking down the road,just like that.
4153	4157	Well, some on the road, some by train,some cross-country.
4157	4159	They'll have forged papers, clothes,
4160	4161	maps, compasses, rations.
4162	4164	You're gonna alertevery goon in the country.
4165	4168	Anybody that can carry a pitchforkis gonna be out looking for you.
4168	4173	They're gonna swoop down and scoopyou up so fast it'd make your head swim.
4176	4177	Yes, well, thanks, anyway.
4178	4181	- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.- That's good of you.
4181	4183	Any time.
4184	4190	Wait a minute. You aren't seriouslysuggesting that if I get through the wire
4190	4193	and case everything out thereand don't get picked up,
4193	4196	to turn myself inand get thrown back in the cooler
4196	4198	so you can get the information you need?
4198	4203	Yes. One has to ask some verystrange things in the job I have.
4203	4206	- We'll give you a front place.- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
4206	4208	- I don't blame you.- Well, OK, then.
4208	4211	- It's completely understandable.- Well, OK, then.
4214	4216	Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.
4223	4225	Check.
4228	4230	Herr Hendley, I...
4230	4233	Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.
4236	4239	- What's the matter, Werner?- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.
4239	4243	Gone. I lost them. Everything.
4244	4246	He lost his wallet.
4246	4249	Do you realise what would happenif Strachwitz found this out?
4249	4251	- The Russian front.- Dear, dear.
4255	4257	I've looked every place, every place.
4258	4261	I must have lost them while I was in here.
4262	4264	- No.- Yes.
4264	4268	Look, I told you we were friends.We'll find them.
4268	4270	Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.
4272	4274	Werner.
4274	4277	Not now. It might look a little peculiar
4277	4281	if you and I were seenprobing around at this time of night.
4282	4287	Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'llfind 'em if I have to tear this room apart.
4294	4296	- Thank you.- Forget it.
4296	4298	- Werner.- Yes?
4298	4300	There is one small favour.
4300	4303	A camera.
4304	4308	We want to take some snapshots.You know, keepsakes.
4309	4313	35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.
4313	4315	Focal-plane shutter.
4317	4320	Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.
4322	4324	Let me know when you got it.
4328	4333	He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,that Werner, but I like him.
4333	4335	Checkmate.
4359	4361	How soon's our air pumpgoing to be ready?
4362	4365	- I'll have it for you tomorrow.- You're badly behind schedule.
4365	4367	- How's it coming, Danny?- No good.
4368	4370	- No good?- Today, three times.
4388	4389	Willie, you all right?
4389	4391	Pull!
4420	4425	You're gonna have to shore up the wholebloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.
4425	4427	Four times today.
4428	4432	This way we never get through.We must have more wood.
4433	4436	It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?
4439	4442	We'll get it. We've gotta get it.
4443	4447	I'll put Hendley on it,and the new man we got this morning.
4448	4449	OK, Willie.
4450	4453	On the first day of Christmasmy true love sent to me
4453	4456	A partridge in a pear tree
4456	4459	On the second day of Christmasmy true love sent to me
4460	4463	Two turtle dovesand a partridge in a pear tree
4464	4467	On the fourth day of Christmasmy true love sent to me
4467	4469	Four calling birds, three French hens

4473	4477	On the fifth day of Christmasmy true love sent to me
4477	4480	Five gold rings
4481	4485	- How's it going with the rafters up there?- Taking out one in four.
4491	4492	Stay with it.
4492	4495	Five gold rings
4495	4497	Four calling birds, three French hens
4497	4501	Two turtle dovesand a partridge in a pear tree
4501	4505	On the seventh day of Christmasmy true love sent to me
4505	4507	Seven swans a-swimming,six geese a-laying
4508	4511	Five gold rings
4511	4513	Four calling birds, three French hens
4513	4517	Two turtle dovesand a partridge in a pear tree
4531	4534	Five gold rings, four calling birds...
4534	4537	Bloody singing. I've never workedso hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.
4537	4538	Say, Cavendish...
4538	4540	Three French hens, two turtle doves
4540	4542	And a partridge in a pear...
4543	4545	Alllz hup!
4551	4553	Never mind.
4563	4566	Here's a present from our friend Werner.
4566	4568	Splendid.
4568	4570	Simply splendid.
4571	4573	This should do very nicely.
4576	4578	Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.
4578	4583	He requested permission to disposeof some of his dirt in our attic.
4651	4655	Tom has reached just beyondthat pile of wood, sir.
4655	4659	- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.- How much further to the trees?
4659	4661	We make it 50 feet, sir.
4662	4665	- Dark of the moon is the 7th...- 8th and 9th.
4665	4667	A day earlier in August.
4673	4675	Morning.
4676	4678	There he goes again.
4678	4681	Why is he buying up allthe potatoes in the camp?
4681	4684	I've been working on that,but I can't find out.
4684	4687	Hilts and Hendleylock themselves in every night.
4687	4690	Sometimes Goff's with them.Other nights he's on guard outside.
4690	4694	Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.Seal them off.
4694	4697	Put the entire effort into Tomand press on into the trees.
4697	4699	Right, Roger.
4747	4748	Wow.
4750	4752	Wow.
4754	4755	Wow.
4782	4783	Wow.
4790	4792	Wow.
4800	4802	Wow.
4852	4853	About face!
4855	4857	Forward march!
4864	4868	- What is it?- They're celebrating the revolution.
4868	4870	It's the 4th of July.
4879	4881	What the devil's this?
4887	4889	Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.
4889	4893	- A little present from the colonials.- Down the British.
4893	4896	- Quite right too.- And a little drink to Tom.
4896	4898	And to getting home.
4898	4900	Very well. We accept.
4900	4902	- Up the rebels!- Down the British!
4902	4903	Gentlemen, follow us.
4903	4905	About face!
4925	4927	Company, halt!
4931	4933	All right, let's line up down here!
4934	4937	All right, grab a cup!
4937	4939	Line it up! Here we go.
4946	4949	That explains what happenedto the potatoes.
4949	4952	No harm in closing down Tomfor one day, Roger.
4952	4955	I suppose it'll do us all goodto let off a bit of steam.
4955	4959	There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and youcan feel it throughout the whole camp.
4959	4962	- I think that calls for a drink.- Hear, hear.
4962	4964	- Drink it up!- What is this stuff, Hilts?
4964	4968	Moonshine.American moonshine. Moonshine.
4968	4970	Make my moustache grow. Cheers.
4970	4973	Keep it moving.
4973	4975	Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.
4975	4977	- There you go.- Down with the British.
4978	4981	All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...
4982	4985	- Don't get any on your clothes.- Cheers!
4986	4989	- Don't spill any of that.- Before your morning tea?
4989	4991	Keep it moving.
4991	4993	Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
4993	4997	American moonshine.Don't smoke right after you drink it.
4997	5000	No smoking.No smoking while you're drinking.
5015	5017	Get good and stoned, my friend.
5019	5022	Keep it going. Keep it...
5022	5026	No taxation without representation.
5026	5029	Keep it going, boys. Keep it...
5030	5032	Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.
5032	5035	Well, let's drink to Tom.
5035	5037	To Tom.
5044	5048	In the three years, seven monthsand two weeks that I've been in the bag,
5048	5051	that's the most extraordinarystuff I've ever tasted.
5051	5055	- It's shattering.- Well, I think it's rather good.
5057	5061	Well, with your permission, sir,I think I'll all on kive.
5062	5064	Call on Ives.
5074	5076	Cheers, Hendley!
5084	5086	You know what that is?
5086	5088	I'll tell you what it isn't.
5089	5091	It isn't Napoleon brandy.
5092	5094	How do you like it, sir?
5095	5097	Well, it's...
5098	5099	To the colonies.
5100	5102	Independence.
5107	5112	How are you managing over there withoutus? Getting along all right, are you?
5112	5115	We seem to be getting along all right,shir... sir.
5123	5125	Yes, well, it's...
5127	5129	It's good stuff, Hilts.
5131	5133	Thank you, sir.
5153	5155	Danny! Here's to...
5163	5165	Roger, goons in 105.
5166	5168	- Who?- Strachwitz.
5171	5176	We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,the goons'll know the hut's important.
5177	5179	Here's to going home.
5194	5197	Come on, Danny.They've searched it a hundred times.
5198	5200	Home!
5212	5216	Anyway, I'm glad we've got youin the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?
5219	5223	Och, never mind. You'll be walking downArgyle Street in a couple of weeks.
5223	5228	To Tom. You know, Sandy,I'm just beginning to realise that myself.
5228	5231	Why shouldn't you, man?We're nearly at the trees, boy.
5231	5233	We're nearly at the trees, eh?
5280	5282	Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
5283	5284	Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
5323	5325	Oh, my God! They've found Tom.
5339	5341	It's the tunnel.
5358	5360	Success.
5384	5385	Ives!
5456	5461	Sir, let me knowthe exact information you need.
5462	5464	- I'm going out tonight.- Right.
5466	5468	Open up Harry.
5469	5471	We dig. Around the clock.
5566	5568	- Cooler.- Right.
5572	5575	Well, I didn't thinkthey'd catch him so soon.
5577	5579	He wasn't caught.
5592	5595	Hilts, welcome home.
5648	5649	Danny?
5651	5653	Danny?
5656	5658	Danny?
5664	5666	Are you all right, Danny?
5668	5670	Yes.
5670	5672	All right.
5674	5677	All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.
5680	5683	For God's sake,you've left out a whole eagle.
5683	5685	That's impossible.
5686	5688	Yes.
5688	5691	Four days' work up the bloody spout!
5693	5695	I'm sorry, Colin.
5695	5697	It's all right, Smithy.
5698	5702	It's getting late.You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.
5702	5704	All right.
5704	5707	- Good night, Colin.- Good night, Smithy.
5747	5749	I can't see a bloody thing.
5777	5781	- Your German's very good.- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...
5781	5786	Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip upa suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.
5786	5789	- I'm sorry, Mac.- OK. But remember, German always.
5802	5806	One, two, three, four, five.
5826	5827	Roger.
5832	5833	No, it's me.
5836	5838	How do you like the old escape suit?
5838	5840	Fine, fine.
5842	5844	Colin.
5846	5849	How do you like mine?
5849	5851	It looks splendid.
5878	5880	Where are you going?You'll get yourself shot.
5880	5884	- What's the matter with you?- I'm going out through that fence.
5886	5889	Danny, we're getting out throughthe tunnel. We're almost clear.
5889	5892	Please, Willie, let me alone.
5892	5895	I can't go in that tunnel any more.
5895	5897	So I'm going out through the wire.
5901	5905	Danny, think. We're getting out,but not through the wire.
5905	5908	We're getting out through the tunnel.It's finished.
5908	5910	- I go out now.- No.
5911	5915	Danny, you go through that wireand you'll get killed.
5922	5924	Don't do that.
5926	5928	Willie...
5930	5932	Since I was a boy,
5932	5937	I hate and feared little rooms,
5937	5939	closets, caves.
5939	5941	Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.Over 17 tunnels.
5941	5944	Because I must get out.
5944	5947	I hide the fear, and I dig.
5948	5952	But tomorrow night in the tunnelwith all those men,
5952	5955	I'm afraid maybe this timeI will lose my head
5955	5958	and ruin the escape for everybody.
5961	5963	So I go now.
5967	5970	Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.
5972	5975	I'll look after you.I'll stick with you all the way.
5977	5979	All right.
5987	5989	- Good evening.- Hello, Roger.
5990	5992	Well, how do you think we look?
5996	5998	It's as bad as all that?
5998	6004	Colin, I want first of all to say that withoutyou, we would not have been ready.
6005	6008	That's all right. I had lots of help.Lots of very good help.
6010	6012	What's the matter, Roger?
6013	6015	You can't go.
6016	6018	- What do you mean?- I can't allow it.
6018	6019	Why?
6019	6022	You can't see your handin front of your face.
6022	6025	You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.
6025	6027	That's ridiculous.
6028	6031	That's ridiculous. Never heardanything so absurd in my life.
6031	6035	I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!
6035	6039	I can see... that pin down there.
6039	6042	- Does that satisfy you?- What pin? Where?
6053	6057	Colin, do you see the foot of the door?
6058	6059	Yes, of course.
6061	6065	Put the pin down there, will you?
6065	6066	All right.
6071	6072	All right. Come on.
6073	6075	Come on. Sit down.
6076	6079	Sit down. It was a good try.
6080	6084	I hate these last-minute letdowns,but I've only just been told.
6085	6088	- It's too risky for you.- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?
6088	6091	- No, I don't.- Come on, Roger.
6091	6096	We all know the score here.Well, at least, most of us do.
6096	6099	Your idea of this escapeis to start another front,
6100	6104	to foul up the Germans behind the lines.All right, that's fine.
6104	6108	But once we get past that wire and havethem looking all over Germany for us,
6109	6111	that mission is accomplished.
6111	6114	Afterwards, we havesome ideas of our own.
6116	6117	You mean getting home?
6118	6120	- Back to your family?- That's right.
6120	6123	Do you really believeI haven't thought about that too?
6123	6125	I'm sure you have.
6127	6129	I know Colin has.
6130	6132	And, Roger, I have too.
6132	6134	We think we can make it all the way.
6134	6139	Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazardto the escape. That must be my decision.
6139	6143	Let's talk about hazard.Let's talk about you.
6143	6147	You're the biggest hazard we have.The Gestapo has you marked.
6149	6151	No one has said you can't go.
6153	6155	That's true.
6155	6157	I have thought about the Gestapo.
6160	6164	But if you're asking me how fara commanding officer is allowed to go,
6164	6166	or dare go,
6167	6169	or should be permitted to play God,
6171	6173	I can't answer you.
6174	6176	But I can tell you
6176	6180	a blind man is an unnecessary hazardto himself and the whole plan,
6180	6183	and must therefore beeliminated from the operation.
6194	6199	Colin's not a blind man as longas he's with me, and he's going with me.
6205	6207	It's all right with you, Colin?
6209	6212	Oh, yes. Quite.
6220	6226	Very well. I'll arrange for your escapenumbers to be altered accordingly.
6226	6228	Good night, gentlemen.
6235	6237	Actually...
6238	6241	he's quite right.
6241	6243	He's completely right.
6243	6245	I really shouldn't go at all.
6245	6249	My eyes have been gettingworse and worse lately.
6249	6252	I think they call it progressive myopia.
6253	6256	I can see things up here. Close to.
6256	6259	I can see to work, but...
6261	6264	you're just a blur.
6264	6266	I know.
6267	6269	Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.
6269	6271	Colin, do you have any tea?
6273	6275	- Yes, of course.- Then let's have some.
6277	6279	Splendid.
6325	6327	Hi, Hilts.
6327	6329	Hey, Mac.
6331	6333	When?
6333	6335	Tonight. We thoughtthey'd never let you out.
6336	6338	Me, too. Let's get at it.
6338	6341	- Bartlett's waiting for you.- I'll be there.
6412	6413	What time?
6415	6418	Only eight minutes now, Danny.
6422	6424	You OK?
6434	6436	Cavendish.
6436	6437	Griff, down there.
6437	6439	Goff, there.
6459	6462	Smith, Foles, third on the right.
6463	6466	Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.
6496	6498	There are the lights.
6499	6502	Right on the tick, Danny.
6511	6514	Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.
6517	6520	It's just like Blackpoolat the height of the season.
6522	6525	You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?
6525	6526	Yes.
6527	6529	No.
6529	6531	I don't know.
6535	6537	It's time, Roger.
6549	6553	Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.
6556	6558	It's all clear, sir.
6567	6569	All set, Roger.
6581	6583	Roger.
6583	6585	Good luck.
6616	6618	They're coming downthe shaft now, Danny.
6619	6622	And then they'll be comingright up the tunnel.
6628	6630	Willie...
6630	6633	I can't wait. I must get out.
6634	6637	Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!
6665	6669	What is it, Danny? What's the matter?Danny! Come here!
6669	6673	Roger? Danny and I'll go later.We'll take another place.
6673	6676	Danny, tell me what this isand tell me quickly!
6676	6680	This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.I dug it. I built it.
6680	6682	I was buried many times.I go when I want.
6682	6684	Let me out. Let me out.
6688	6690	Take him out, Willie. Take him out.
6705	6707	Danny? What is it?
6707	6710	Danny, what's going on?
6710	6713	It's all right, Sedgwick.It's all right. We're going later.
6719	6722	Danny, it's all right. It's all right.
6722	6726	We can take another place in the line.It's all right.
6727	6729	All right, Colin. Down you go.
6729	6734	Sit down. Feel the top rung ofthe ladder with your right foot. Got it?
6734	6736	Down you go.
6752	6754	Danny cut out, huh?
6754	6756	Willie took him up top. Hilts, I...
6769	6772	- Remember, keep your head down.- Right.
6789	6791	Right.
6798	6800	Bartlett.
6838	6840	All right?
6841	6844	- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.- What do you mean?
6844	6847	20 feet short of the woods.The hole is in the open.
6847	6850	The guard is between us and the lights.
6850	6852	How could that happen?
6852	6855	What the hell difference does it make?It's happened.
6869	6872	- Roger...- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!
6873	6875	We could postpone it.
6875	6878	All the documents are dated today.It's now or never.
6882	6887	One chance. When the guard goes to thefar end, you might be able to move out.
6887	6891	I think I can make it to the woods,set up a signal when you're clear.
6892	6893	What about the towers?
6893	6896	They're gonna be watchingthe compound, not the woods.
6901	6903	Mac, pass the word.Send down 30 feet of rope.
6904	6906	Send down 30 feet of rope!
6908	6910	Send down 30 feet of rope.
6912	6914	Send down 30 feet of rope!
6914	6916	- What?- 30 feet of rope!
6916	6919	- What do they want that for?- How should I know? Get the rope.
6934	6939	- How's it going? Have you heard?- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.
6939	6943	- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?- I don't think so, sir.
6965	6967	He's over there.
6973	6975	Right. You go first, Eric.
6977	6979	I'm staying here till we get moving.
6990	6993	- See you in Piccadilly.- Scott's Bar.
6993	6994	Right.
7007	7009	Thank you.
7009	7011	- Good luck.- Right.
7035	7037	We're moving.
7044	7048	Danny, they're moving throughthe tunnel now. They're getting out.
7051	7056	When Warsaw fell, you escaped andcame to England because you're a flier.
7056	7061	You came because you wanted to flywith us and fight the Germans.
7061	7064	We can get out now.We can get back to England.
7066	7068	If you don't go through that tunnel,
7068	7072	everything you've donewill have been for nothing - nothing!
7100	7102	- Blythe's behind, Mac.- Right.
7105	7107	In here, Colin.
7108	7110	Sit down.
7114	7117	You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.
7120	7123	- What have you got in here? A piano?- That's very funny, mate.
7124	7126	- You won't get this thing through.- I'll cope.
7130	7133	- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?- Who else?
7133	7136	I wish he was home with his kangaroos.
7142	7146	- We're 20 feet short.- How the hell...?
7146	7148	Hilts is on the other endof that rope in the woods.
7148	7153	As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,off you go, but keep Colin low.
7154	7156	- Good luck, Colin.- Thanks, Mac.
7166	7168	What's that?
7169	7172	- It's an air raid.- Oh, God! No!
7172	7175	The goons'll pull the switches.We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.
7176	7179	Come on, Colin. We can get outwhen the lights go down.
7191	7193	Willie.
7194	7195	Willie!
7197	7200	It's an air raid.Searchlights are out. Come on!
7206	7208	Get 'em out.
7213	7215	- It's gonna give!- Danny.
7215	7219	Danny. Danny, it's all right.Danny, it's the lights.
7221	7224	Light the lamps down there!
7225	7227	There's been an air raidand they've cut the lights.
7227	7230	Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!
7232	7234	Danny, look.
7237	7242	Come on, fellas. Move! Move!We can get dozens out in this darkness.
7248	7251	What the hell's going on?
7251	7254	- You go.- No. Danny.
7256	7257	Go.
7265	7267	- What is this, Willie?- Danny.
7267	7269	- Is he stuck in there?- He's all right.
7269	7271	Get him out fast.
7274	7276	Come on.
7278	7280	Come on, Danny, move.
7297	7298	Up you go.
7304	7306	Give me your bag.
7313	7315	We're on the rope!
7360	7364	You and I had better get out, or we won'thave a chance of any of the trains.
7364	7368	It's moving. We'll just have to passthe instructions from man to man.
7369	7371	- Right.- I'll be right behind you.
7418	7420	Come on, come on.
7439	7440	Come on.
7459	7460	- Hey!- Don't shoot!
7461	7463	Don't shoot!
7464	7466	Don't shoot!
7470	7472	Get off! We're coming back!
7495	7498	Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lotof shooting going on up there.
7498	7501	Think they've been shooting themas they came out?
7501	7504	We would've heard the shots before.
7506	7507	Pull!
7507	7509	Wait for me.
7515	7517	Out.
7538	7539	Out.
7573	7575	- How many did he say?- 76.
7575	7577	76.
7577	7579	- 76.- 76.
7593	7595	- Dismissed.- Ten hut!
7652	7655	Half the guys who missedtheir trains are piled up here.
7655	7658	Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.
7658	7660	Makes quite a group.
7660	7664	- What do we do?- Wait for the train.
8029	8031	Tallyho.
8074	8076	Tallyho.
8109	8113	- Are the police on the train?- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.
8113	8115	All right.
8119	8123	- I'll tell you when.- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.
8143	8146	- Are you all right?- Yes, I'm fine.
8146	8148	That's quite exciting.
8150	8153	- It isn't stopping.- No, we're all right.
8209	8211	Switzerland.
8244	8245	Hey!
8494	8494	Bartlett.
8554	8559	- Where were you going, Cavendish?- I... I hadn't quite decided.
8559	8562	What information were youto collect on the way?
8562	8562	None.
8563	8565	What sabotage directionsdid you receive?
8565	8568	What have you done with your papers?
8570	8573	- Papers?- Forged papers and identity cards.
8573	8576	Don't be so stupid.What did you do with them?
8576	8578	All I did was escape from a prison camp.
8579	8582	You'd do the same if you'd beenlocked up for three years.
8583	8587	- I wanted to get home.- I don't think you'll see your wife again.
8587	8589	You've got the wrong man.I'm not even married.
8589	8592	You're wearing civilian clothes.
8593	8596	You're a spy. Spies are being shot.
8597	8600	This is my uniform.I had to recut it when I lost weight.
8602	8605	I dyed it with boot polishto cover some oil smears
8605	8607	I picked up when I was shot down.
8618	8621	And you lost your insigniaover the years?
8621	8623	That's right.
8628	8630	- Look...- That's all, Cavendish.
8655	8657	Hello, boys.
8661	8663	Hello.
8665	8667	- Hello, Haynes.- Hello, Cavendish.
8669	8671	I wish I could say I was happyto see you again.
8672	8674	- Just picked up?- Yes, this morning.
8692	8694	There's a trainer out there I can fly.
8695	8697	- Any sentries?- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.
8765	8770	Colin, when I say go,crank this clockwise.
8771	8775	When the engine catches, don't move,or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.
8789	8790	Go!
8840	8842	Next stop, Switzerland!
8925	8927	The Alps.
8927	8928	Splendid.
8940	8944	Over this range, then 20 more minutesand we've got it made.
8971	8975	- What is it? Petrol?- I don't know. We're losing power.
9001	9003	Go that way! I'll follow.
9028	9029	Hendley?
9034	9036	Colin!
9039	9042	Stop! Don't shoot! Please!
9046	9050	Colin, I'm sorry I fouled things up.
9051	9053	That's all right.
9054	9056	Thank you for...
9057	9060	getting me out.
9243	9245	Cafe Suzette.
9278	9280	Hello?
9281	9283	Hello?
9320	9321	Resistance.
9321	9323	Resistance?
9324	9326	You are English?
9326	9328	I'm Australian.
9329	9334	- You can speak English. I understand.- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.
9334	9338	I've just escaped froma prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.
9338	9342	I'm trying to make my way into Spain.You understand me?
9342	9344	Can you help me?
9347	9350	- I know someone who can.- Bloody good.
9394	9395	Good luck.
9396	9397	Thank you.
9510	9512	You are English.
9553	9555	Herr Bartlett?
9563	9565	Your German is good.
9565	9568	And I hear also your French.
9570	9572	Your arms... up!
9609	9611	Herr Bartlett.
9611	9614	And Herr MacDonald.
9617	9619	We are together again.
9619	9623	You are going to wishyou had never put us to so much trouble.
9639	9643	- What's troubling you, Roger?- I'm just a little surprised.
9643	9646	I expected either a long stayor a very short trip.
9647	9649	Yes.
9649	9651	I have to admit,I'm a little worried, though.
9651	9654	I hope to God I haven'tblotted 70-odd ledgers.
9654	9656	Och, no, no.
9656	9660	We're all over 21,footloose and fancy-free.
9660	9663	We'd never have got as faras we did without you, Roger.
9663	9667	For what it's worth,I think you did a damn good job.
9667	9670	- I think we all do.- Yes.
9710	9713	All right. You can get out now.Stretch your legs for five minutes.
9714	9717	It will take hoursbefore you reach the camp.
9738	9744	You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,tunnelling, Tom and Harry -
9744	9746	kept me alive.
9747	9749	And even though we...
9750	9752	I've never been happier.
9753	9755	You know, Mac...
9796	9799	11 of your men are being returned today.
9799	9800	Oh, who?
9800	9803	I do not have that information.
9803	9805	I...
9806	9810	I am directed by a higher authorityto inform you that...
9811	9815	50 of your officerswere shot while escaping.
9816	9818	Shot?
9819	9822	Their... personal effects will be returned.
9826	9828	How many of them were wounded?
9829	9832	Here are the names... of the dead.
9836	9839	How many of the 50 were wounded?
9840	9842	None.
9843	9845	They - the higher authority -
9846	9849	only directs me to inform you that...
9851	9853	that 50 men were...
9859	9861	I see.
9863	9865	Addison, John.
9865	9867	Alladale, Peter.
9867	9869	Bancroft, Edward.
9869	9871	Bartlett, Roger.
9871	9873	Cavendish, Dennis.
9874	9876	Eldridge, David.
9876	9878	Felton, William.
9879	9881	Fanshaw, Arthur.
9965	9967	I am your guide, senor.
9968	9970	Spain?
9991	9994	- Glad to see you're all safe.- Thank you, sir.
9994	9996	- How many have been brought back?- You're the first.
9996	10000	- Do you know how many got away?- Not yet.
10000	10002	What happened to Blythe?
10003	10005	He didn't make it, sir.
10005	10007	Roger was right about that.
10008	10011	I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.
10013	10017	I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.
10018	10020	The Gestapo murdered them.
10021	10023	50?
10023	10025	MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?
10025	10026	Yes.
10026	10028	Danny and Willie?
10028	10030	No, they're not on the list.
10030	10032	- Haynes?- Yes.
10035	10036	I'm sorry.
10038	10041	Roger's idea was to get back atthe enemy the hardest way he could.
10041	10044	Mess up the works.
10044	10047	From what we've heard here,I think he did exactly that.
10048	10050	Do you think it was worth the price?
10051	10053	That depends on yourpoint of view, Hendley.
10057	10058	Yes, sir.
10108	10112	He is not to be saluted.He's no longer in command.
10120	10122	The job just didn't work out, huh?
10122	10126	- You were lucky, Hilts.- Lucky? Because I didn't...
10128	10130	How many?
10130	10132	50.
10133	10138	It looks, after all, as ifyou will see Berlin before I do.
10191	10193	Sir.
10199	10201	Hey, Hilts!
