203	205	Echo Three to Echo Seven.
205	207	Han, old buddy,do you read me?
207	209	Loud and clear, kid.What's up?
209	212	I finished my circle.I don't pick up any life readings.
212	215	There isn't enough life on this ice cubeto fill a space cruiser.
215	217	The sensors are placed.I'm going back.
217	218	Right. I'll see you shortly.
219	221	There's a meteoritethat hit the ground near here.
221	223	I want to check it out.It won't take long.
223	224	Steady.
225	228	Steady, girl. What's the matter?You smell something?
268	270	Chewie. Chewie?
275	278	All right.Don't lose your temper.
278	280	I'll come right backand give you a hand.
300	301	Solo.
301	303	No sign of life out there, General.The sensors are in place.
304	306	- You'll know if anything comes around.- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
306	309	No. He's checking outa meteorite that hit near him.
309	313	With all the meteor activity, it's gonnabe difficult to spot approaching ships.
313	315	General, I gotta leave.I can't stay any more.
315	317	- I'm sorry to hear that.- There's a price on my head.
318	320	If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,I'm a dead man.
320	322	A death mark's notan easy thing to live with.
323	326	You're a good fighter, Solo.I hate to lose you.
326	327	Thank you, General.
335	337	Well, Your Highness,guess this is it.
338	339	That's right.
341	344	Don't get all mushy on me.So long, Princess.
347	348	Han.
349	352	- Yes, Your Highnessness.- I thought you had decided to stay.
353	355	The bounty hunter we ran intoin Ord Mantell changed my mind.
355	357	Han, we need you.
358	360	- We need?- Yes.
360	362	- What about you need?- I need?
362	365	I don't know whatyou're talking about.
365	368	- You probably don't.- What precisely am I supposed to know?
368	371	Come on. You want me to stay becauseof the way you feel about me.
372	374	Yes. You're a great help to us.You're a natural leader.
374	377	No. That's not it.
377	378	Come on.
380	381	- Come on.- You're imagining things.
382	383	Am I?Then why are you following me?
384	386	Afraid I'd leavewithout giving you a goodbye kiss?
386	388	- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.- I can arrange that.
388	390	You could use a good kiss!
391	394	Don't blame me. I didn't ask youto turn on the thermal heater.
394	397	I merely commented that it was freezingin the princess's chamber.
398	399	It's supposed to be freezing.
399	402	How we're going to dryher clothes I really don't know.
402	403	Oh, switch off!
403	406	Why did you take this apart now?I'm trying to get us out of here.
406	408	- Excuse me.- Put them back together right now.
408	410	- Might I have a word?- What do you want?
411	413	Princess Leia's been tryingto get you on the communicator.
413	415	I turned it off.I don't want to talk to her.
415	418	Princess Leia is wondering aboutMaster Luke. He hasn't come back.
418	420	- She doesn't know where he is.- I don't know where he is.
420	423	- Nobody knows where he is.- What do you mean, nobody knows?
423	424	Deck Officer.
425	427	- Deck Officer.- Excuse me, sir. Might l...
427	429	Do you know whereCommander Skywalker is?
429	431	I haven't seen him. It's possiblehe came in the south entrance.
432	434	It's possible?Why don't you go find out?
434	436	- It's getting dark out there.- Yes, sir.
436	439	Excuse me, sir.Might I enquire what's going on?
439	441	- Why not?- Impossible man.
441	443	Come along, R2.Let's find Princess Leia.
443	446	Between ourselves, I thinkMaster Luke is in considerable danger.
455	457	Commander Skywalkerhasn't come in the south entrance.
457	460	- Maybe he forgot to check in.- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
460	462	Not yet. We're having troubleadapting them to the cold.
462	465	- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.
465	467	That's right,and my friend's out in it.
472	474	Your tauntaun will freezebefore you reach the first marker.
474	476	Then I'll see you in hell.
608	610	You must come along now, R2.
610	612	There's reallynothing more we can do.
612	614	And my joints are freezing up.
615	619	Don't say things like that.Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
619	622	And he'll be quite all right.You'll see.
622	625	Stupid little short circuit.He'll be quite all right.
681	683	Sir, all the patrols are in.Still no...
685	687	Still no contactfrom Skywalker or Solo.
687	691	Mistress Leia, R2 says he's beenquite unable to pick up any signals...
691	695	although he admits that his own rangeis far too weak to abandon all hope.
695	697	Your Highness,there's nothing more we can do tonight.
697	699	The shield doors must be closed.
700	703	- Close the doors.- Yes, sir.
704	709	R2 says the chancesof survival are 725-to-1.
720	723	Actually, R2 has been knownto make mistakes...
726	728	from time to time.
728	730	Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
733	735	Don't worry about Master Luke.I'm sure he'll be all right.
735	738	He's quite clever, you know,for a human being.
754	755	Luke.
757	758	Luke.
765	767	Ben?
767	769	You will go tothe Dagobah system.
770	771	Dagobah system?
771	775	There you willlearn from Yoda...
775	778	the Jedi masterwho instructed me.
796	799	Don't do this, Luke.Give me a sign here.
822	824	- Not much time.- Ben.
831	832	Hang on, kid.
834	836	Dagobah system. Dagobah.
836	838	This may smell bad, kid...
839	841	Yoda.
841	845	But it'll keep you warmtill I get the shelter up.
845	847	Ben. Dagobah.
851	853	I thought they smelled bad...
853	855	on the outside.
896	899	Echo Base, I've got something.
899	901	Not much,but it could be a life form.
905	907	Commander Skywalker,do you copy?
907	909	This is Rogue Two.
909	912	This is Rogue Two.
912	915	Captain Solo, do you copy?
920	923	Commander Skywalker,do you copy?
924	925	This is Rogue Two.
925	928	Good morning.Nice of you guys to drop by.
929	932	Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
932	935	I've found them.Repeat. I've found them.
964	965	Master Luke, sir, it's so goodto see you fully functional again.
965	967	Master Luke, sir, it's so goodto see you fully functional again.
968	970	- Thanks, 3PO.- R2 expresses his relief also.
970	974	How ya feelin', kid?You don't look so bad to me.
974	976	You look strong enoughto pull the ears off a gundark.
977	980	- Thanks to you.- That's two you owe me, junior.
980	982	Well, Your Worship...
982	985	Iooks like you managed to keep me aroundfor a little while longer.
985	987	I had nothing to do with it.
987	989	General Rieekan thinksit's dangerous for any ships to leave...
989	991	until we've activated the energy field.
991	993	That's a good story.
993	996	I think you just can't bear to let agorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
997	1000	I don't know whereyou get your delusions, laser brain.
1003	1005	Laugh it up, fuzzball...
1005	1008	but you didn't see us alonein the south passage.
1008	1011	She expressedher true feelings for me.
1011	1012	My...
1012	1015	Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...
1015	1017	scruffy-looking nerf herder!
1018	1020	Who's scruffy-lookin'?
1024	1027	I must have hit close to the markto get her riled up like that, huh, kid?
1030	1033	I guess you don't knoweverything about women yet.
1039	1042	Headquarters personnel,report to command centre.
1044	1047	Headquarters personnel,report to command centre.
1047	1049	Take it easy.
1049	1051	Excuse us, please.
1054	1055	Princess, we have a visitor.
1057	1059	We picked up somethingoutside Zone 12 moving east.
1060	1062	- It's metal.- It couldn't be one of those creatures.
1062	1065	- Could be one of our speeders.- No. Wait.
1066	1068	There's somethingvery weak coming through.
1071	1074	Sir, I am fluent in six millionforms of communication.
1074	1077	This signal is not used by the Alliance.It could be an imperial code.
1083	1085	It isn't friendly.Chewie, let's check it out.
1085	1088	Send Rogues 10 and 11to Station 38.
1123	1125	- I'm afraid there's not much left.- What was it?
1125	1127	Droid of some kind.I didn't hit it that hard.
1127	1130	- Must have had a self-destruct.- An imperial probe droid.
1130	1133	It's a good bet the Empireknows we're here.
1133	1135	We'd better start the evacuation.
1179	1181	- Admiral.- Yes, Captain?
1182	1185	I think we've got something, sir.The report is only a fragment...
1185	1188	from a probe droid in the Hoth system,but it's the best lead we've had.
1188	1191	We have thousands of probe droidssearching the galaxy.
1191	1194	- I want proof, not leads.- The visuals indicate life readings.
1194	1196	It could mean anything.If we followed up every lead...
1196	1199	But, sir, the Hoth system issupposed to be devoid of humans forms.
1199	1202	- You found something?- Yes, my lord.
1204	1206	That's it.The rebels are there.
1207	1211	My lord, there are so manyuncharted settlements.
1211	1213	- It could be smugglers...- That is the system.
1214	1216	And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
1216	1219	Set your coursefor the Hoth system.
1219	1221	General Veers,prepare your men.
1221	1223	Admiral.
1229	1231	Groups Seven and 10will stay behind to fly the speeders.
1231	1233	As soon as each transport is loaded...
1233	1235	evacuation controlwill give clearance for launch.
1235	1237	Right, sir.
1239	1241	All right. That's it.
1241	1242	Try it.
1244	1247	Turn it off! Turn it off!
1249	1252	Sir, it will take quite a whileto evacuate the T-47 s.
1252	1256	Forget the heavy equipment. There's timeto get small modules on the transports.
1256	1258	- Take care, sir.- Thanks.
1261	1264	Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
1268	1269	Okay, okay.
1271	1272	Hi, kid.
1272	1275	There's gotta be a reason for it.Check it at the other end.
1275	1277	Wait a second.
1278	1280	- Are you all right?- Yeah.
1286	1288	Be careful.
1288	1290	You too.
1296	1298	General, there'sa fleet of Stardestroyers...
1298	1300	coming out of hyperspacein Sector Four.
1300	1303	Reroute all powerto the energy shield.
1303	1306	We gotta hold them tillall transports are away.
1306	1308	Prepare for ground assault.
1321	1325	- What is it, General?- The fleet has moved out of light speed.
1325	1327	ComScan has detectedan energy field...
1327	1329	protecting an area of the sixth planetof the Hoth system.
1329	1332	The field is strong enoughto deflect any bombardment.
1332	1334	The rebels are alertedto our presence.
1334	1337	Admiral Ozzel came out of light speedtoo close to the system.
1337	1340	He felt surprise was wiser.
1340	1342	He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
1342	1345	General, prepare your troopsfor a surface attack.
1345	1347	Yes, my lord.
1354	1355	Lord Vader.
1355	1358	The fleet has moved out of light speed,and we're preparing to...
1359	1363	You have failed mefor the last time, Admiral.
1363	1365	- Captain Piett.- Yes, my lord?
1365	1368	Make ready to land our troopsbeyond their energy field...
1368	1371	and deploy the fleet so thatnothing gets off the system.
1371	1374	You are in command now,Admiral Piett.
1374	1376	Thank you, Lord Vader.
1378	1381	All troop carriers will assembleat the north entrance.
1381	1383	The heavy transport shipswill leave as soon as they're loaded.
1383	1385	Only two fighter escorts per ship.
1386	1388	The energy shieldcan only be opened for a short time...
1389	1391	so you'll have to stay very closeto your transports.
1391	1393	Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
1393	1395	The ion cannon will fireseveral shots...
1395	1398	to make sure that any enemy shipswill be out of your flight path.
1398	1400	When you've gotten pastthe energy shield...
1401	1402	proceed directlyto the rendezvous point.
1403	1404	Understood?
1405	1406	Good luck.
1406	1409	Everybody to your stations.Let's go.
1425	1428	Their primary target will bethe power generators.
1428	1430	Prepare to open shield.
1435	1438	Sir, rebel ships arecoming into our sector.
1438	1440	Good. Our first catch of the day.
1442	1444	Stand by, ion control.
1445	1446	Fire.
1460	1463	The first transport is away.
1463	1466	The first transport is away.
1472	1474	Feeling all right, sir?
1474	1476	Just like new, Dak.How about you?
1476	1479	Right now I feel I could take onthe whole Empire myself.
1479	1481	I know what you mean.
1498	1502	Echo Station 3-T8.We've spotted imperial walkers.
1502	1504	Imperial walkerson the north ridge.
1525	1527	Echo Station 57,we're on our way.
1533	1535	All right, boys,keep tight now.
1535	1537	Luke, I have no approach vector.I'm not set.
1537	1538	Steady, Dak.
1538	1540	Attack pattern Delta.Go now.
1544	1545	I'm coming in.
1550	1551	Hobbie, you still with me?
1573	1575	That armour's too strong for blasters.
1577	1579	Rogue Group,use your harpoons and tow cables.
1579	1581	Go for the legs.It might be our only chance.
1584	1585	Stand by, Dak.
1585	1587	Luke, we've gota malfunction in fire control.
1588	1590	I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
1590	1591	Just hang on.
1592	1594	Hang on, Dak.Get ready to fire that tow cable.
1599	1600	Dak?
1624	1626	Yes, Lord Vader.I've reached the main power generators.
1626	1629	The shield will be down in moments.You may start your landing.
1634	1635	Rogue Three.
1635	1637	Copy, Rogue Leader.
1637	1640	Wedge, I've lost my gunner.You'll have to make this shot.
1640	1642	I'll cover for you.
1642	1644	Set your harpoon.Follow me on the next pass.
1645	1647	Coming around, Rogue Leader.
1650	1651	Steady, Rogue Two.
1652	1653	Activate harpoon.
1656	1657	Good shot, Janson.
1663	1665	One more pass.
1671	1673	Cable out.Let her go!
1673	1674	Detach cable.
1675	1676	Cable detached.
1684	1685	Come on!
1693	1695	- That got him!- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
1696	1698	I don't think we can protecttwo transports at a time.
1698	1700	It's risky, but we can'thold out much longer.
1700	1702	We have no choice.
1703	1705	- Launch patrol.- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
1710	1713	This one goes there,that one goes there. Right?
1713	1717	R2, you take good careof Master Luke now, understand?
1718	1720	And do take good care of yourself.
1724	1725	Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1748	1750	All troops will debarkfor ground assault.
1751	1753	Prepare to targetthe main generator.
1756	1760	- Rogue Two, are you all right?- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
1760	1762	Set harpoon.I'll cover for you.
1763	1766	- Coming around.- Watch that crossfire, boys.
1767	1769	Set for position three.
1769	1770	Steady.
1771	1773	Stay tight and low.This is it!
1779	1780	Hobbie!
1780	1781	I've been hit!
1822	1825	- You all right?- Why are you still here?
1825	1828	- Heard the command centre had been hit.- You've got your clearance to leave.
1828	1831	Don't worry. I'll leave.First I'm gonna get you to your ship.
1831	1834	Your Highness, we must takethis last transport. It's our only hope.
1835	1837	Send all troops in Sector 12 tothe south slope to protect the fighters.
1839	1841	Imperial troopshave entered the base.
1841	1843	Imperial troops have entered...
1843	1845	Come on. That's it.
1845	1847	Give the evacuation code signal.
1849	1851	And get to your transports.
1851	1852	Wait for me.
1852	1853	Begin retreat!
1855	1856	Fall back!
1912	1915	- Distance to power generators?- 17.28.
1924	1925	Target. Maximum firepower.
1951	1953	Transport, this is Solo.Take off. I can't get to you.
1953	1955	I'll get her out on the Falcon.Come on.
1958	1960	Where are you going?Come back!
1977	1981	Wait! Wait for me! Stop!
1981	1982	- How typical.- Come on.
1986	1989	Hurry up, goldenrod!You're gonna be a permanent resident.
1989	1991	Wait! Wait!
2008	2011	- How's this?- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
2011	2013	- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.- It might.
2015	2017	Sir, might I suggest that you...
2017	2019	It can wait.
2023	2025	This bucket of boltswill never get past that blockade.
2025	2027	This baby's gota few surprises left in her.
2036	2038	Come on! Come on!
2038	2041	Switch over.Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
2043	2043	See?
2044	2046	Someday you'll be wrong.I hope I'm there to see it.
2049	2050	Punch it!
2067	2068	R2.
2070	2072	Get her ready for take-off.
2074	2076	Good luck, Luke.See you at the rendezvous.
2079	2081	Don't worry, R2.We're going. We're going.
2093	2097	There's nothing wrong, R2.I'm just setting a new course.
2100	2104	We're not gonna regroup with the others.We're going to the Dagobah system.
2106	2108	Yes, R2.
2110	2113	That's all right. I'd like to keep iton manual control for a while.
2129	2132	- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!- Saw what?
2132	2134	Stardestroyers,two of'em coming right at us.
2134	2137	- Sir, might I suggest...- Shut him up or shut him down!
2138	2140	Check the deflector shield.
2142	2144	Great. Well, we can stilloutmanoeuvre them.
2148	2150	Take evasive action!
2161	2164	- Prepare to jump to light speed.- But, sir!
2165	2167	They're getting closer.
2167	2169	Oh, yeah?Watch this.
2172	2173	Watch what?
2175	2177	- I think we're in trouble.- If I may say so...
2177	2180	I noticed earlier the hyperdrivemotivator has been damaged.
2180	2183	- It's impossible to go to light speed.- We're in trouble.
2187	2188	Horizontal boosters!
2190	2192	Alluvial dampers.
2195	2197	That's not it.Bring me the hydrospanner.
2201	2203	I don't know howwe're gonna get out of this one.
2206	2207	Chewie!
2211	2212	That wasn't a laser blast.Something hit us.
2213	2214	Han, get up here.
2216	2217	Come on, Chewie!
2218	2219	Asteroids.
2223	2225	- Chewie, set 271.- What are you doing?
2227	2229	You're not actually goinginto an asteroid field?
2229	2230	They'd be crazy to follow us,wouldn't they?
2234	2235	You don't have to do thisto impress me.
2235	2238	Sir, the possibility of successfullynavigating an asteroid field...
2239	2242	- is approximately 3,720-to-1.- Never tell me the odds.
2269	2272	You said you wanted to be around whenI made a mistake. This could be it.
2272	2273	I take it back.
2273	2276	We're gonna get pulverizedif we stay out here much longer.
2276	2278	- Ain't gonna argue with that.- Pulverized?
2278	2280	I'm going closerto one of the big ones.
2280	2282	- Closer?- Closer?
2308	2310	This is suicide!There's nowhere to go.
2310	2312	There. That looks pretty good.
2312	2314	What looks pretty good?
2314	2316	Yeah. That'll do nicely.
2316	2319	Excuse me, ma'am,but where are we going?
2328	2331	I hope you knowwhat you're doing.
2331	2332	Yeah. Me too.
2341	2343	Yep, that's it. Dagobah.
2345	2347	No, I'm not gonna changemy mind about this.
2348	2350	I'm not picking upany cities or technology.
2351	2352	Massive life form readings though.
2354	2355	There's something alive down there.
2357	2360	Yes. I'm sureit's perfectly safe for droids.
2367	2369	I know! I know!
2369	2372	All the scopes are dead.I can't see a thing.
2372	2375	Just hang on.I'm gonna start the landing cycle.
2427	2429	No, R2, you stay put.I'll have a look around.
2433	2435	R2?
2438	2439	Where are you?
2443	2444	R2!
2451	2452	You be more careful.
2455	2458	R2, that way.
2485	2486	R2!
2513	2514	Oh, no.
2515	2517	Are you all right?Come on.
2521	2523	You were luckyto get out of there.
2524	2525	Anything broken?
2528	2531	If you're sayingcoming here was a bad idea...
2531	2533	I'm beginning to agree with ya.
2533	2536	R2, what are we doing here?
2536	2537	It's like...
2538	2540	something out of a dream or...
2541	2543	I don't know.
2543	2545	Maybe I'm just going crazy.
2576	2578	Yes, Admiral?
2578	2580	Our ships have sightedthe Millennium Falcon, lord...
2580	2583	but it has entered an asteroid field,and we cannot risk...
2583	2586	Asteroids do notconcern me, Admiral.
2586	2589	- I want that ship, not excuses.- Yes, lord.
2595	2598	I'm gonna shut down everythingbut the emergency power systems.
2598	2602	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but doesthat include shutting me down too?
2602	2604	No. I need youto talk to the Falcon...
2604	2606	find out what's wrongwith the hyperdrive.
2614	2617	Sir, it's quite possiblethis asteroid is not entirely stable.
2617	2619	Not entirely stable?
2619	2621	I'm glad you're hereto tell us these things.
2621	2625	Chewie, take the professor in the backand plug him into the hyperdrive.
2625	2627	Sometimes I just don'tunderstand human behaviour.
2627	2630	After all, I'm onlytrying to do my job.
2635	2636	Let go.
2638	2640	- Let go, please.- Don't get excited.
2640	2644	Captain, being held by youisn't quite enough to get me excited.
2644	2645	Sorry, sweetheart.
2646	2648	I haven't got timefor anything else.
2681	2684	Ready for some power?Okay.
2688	2690	Let's see now.
2690	2692	Put that in there.There you go.
2695	2698	Now all I gotta dois find this Yoda...
2698	2700	if he even exists.
2705	2708	It's really a strange placeto find a Jedi master.
2709	2711	This place gives me the creeps.
2715	2716	Still...
2718	2719	there's something familiarabout this place.
2722	2723	I don't know.
2723	2725	- I feel like...- Feel like what?
2726	2728	Like we're being watched.
2728	2731	Away put your weapon.I mean you no harm.
2732	2735	I am wondering,why are you here?
2736	2739	- I'm looking for someone.- Looking?
2739	2742	Found someone you have,I would say.
2743	2745	Right.
2746	2748	Help you I can. Yes.
2749	2750	I don't think so.
2751	2754	I'm looking for a great warrior.
2754	2756	Great warrior.
2759	2761	Wars not make one great.
2769	2770	Put that down.
2771	2772	Hey! That's my dinner.
2776	2778	How you get so bigeating food of this kind?
2778	2780	Listen, friend, we didn't meanto land in that puddle.
2781	2783	If we could get our ship out, we would.But we can't.
2783	2785	Aw, cannot get your ship out.
2785	2787	Get out of there.
2790	2792	Hey, you could have broken this.
2794	2796	Don't do that.
2804	2806	You're making a mess.
2808	2810	Hey, give me that.
2810	2812	Mine, or I will help you not.
2812	2814	I don't want your help.I want my lamp back.
2814	2817	I'm gonna need it to get out ofthis slimy mud-hole.
2817	2819	Mud-hole? Slimy?My home this is.
2823	2824	R2, let him have it.
2827	2830	- Mine! Mine! Mine!- R2.
2833	2837	Will you move along, little fella?We got a lot of work to do.
2838	2841	Stay and help you I will.Find your friend.
2842	2844	I'm not looking for a friend.I'm looking for a Jedi master.
2846	2849	Jedi master. Yoda.
2849	2851	- You seek Yoda.- You know him?
2853	2855	Take you to him I will.
2856	2859	Yes, yes, but now we must eat.
2859	2862	Come.Good food. Come.
2871	2873	Come, come.
2875	2876	R2...
2877	2879	stay and watch after the camp.
2892	2894	Where is R2 when I need him?
2894	2897	Sir, I don't know where your shiplearned to communicate...
2897	2898	but it has the most peculiar dialect.
2899	2902	I believe it says the power couplingon the negative axis has been polarized.
2902	2904	I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
2905	2908	Well, of courseI'll have to replace it.
2909	2911	Here. And, Chewie...
2913	2915	I think we better replacethe negative power coupling.
2937	2939	Hey, Your Worship,I'm only trying to help.
2939	2942	Would you pleasestop calling me that?
2942	2944	Sure, Leia.
2944	2947	- You make it so difficult sometimes.- I do. I really do.
2948	2950	You could be a little nicer though.
2950	2953	Admit it.Sometimes you think I'm all right.
2955	2957	Occasionally, maybe...
2957	2960	when you aren't actinglike a scoundrel.
2960	2961	Scoundrel?
2965	2967	I like the sound of that.
2968	2970	- Stop that.- Stop what?
2971	2973	Stop that.My hands are dirty.
2973	2975	My hands are dirty too.What are you afraid of?
2975	2977	- Afraid?- You're trembling.
2978	2980	I'm not trembling.
2981	2984	You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
2984	2986	There aren't enoughscoundrels in your life.
2986	2988	I happen to like nice men.
2988	2991	- I'm a nice man.- No, you're not.
2994	2995	Sir, sir!
2995	2998	I've isolatedthe reverse power flux coupling.
3000	3001	Thank you.
3001	3004	- Thank you very much.- You're perfectly welcome, sir.
3010	3013	That, Lord Vader, was the last timethey appeared in any of our scopes.
3013	3016	Considering the damage we've sustained,they must have been destroyed.
3016	3019	No, Captain, they're alive.
3019	3023	I want every ship available to sweepthe asteroid field until they are found.
3028	3031	- Lord Vader.- Yes, Admiral. What is it?
3031	3033	The emperor commands youto make contact with him.
3033	3035	Move the ship out ofthe asteroid field...
3035	3037	so that we can senda clear transmission.
3038	3039	Yes, my lord.
3055	3057	What is thy bidding, my master?
3059	3063	There is a great disturbancein the Force.
3063	3066	I have felt it.
3066	3068	We have a new enemy...
3068	3072	the young rebel who destroyedthe Death Star.
3072	3075	I have no doubt this boy...
3075	3080	is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
3080	3082	How is that possible?
3082	3085	Search your feelings, Lord Vader.
3085	3088	You will know it to be true.
3089	3091	He could destroy us.
3091	3093	He's just a boy.
3093	3096	Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
3096	3099	The Force is strong with him.
3100	3105	The son of Skywalkermust not become a Jedi.
3105	3107	If he could be turned...
3107	3110	he would become a powerful ally.
3111	3113	Yes.
3114	3118	He would be a great asset.
3118	3120	Can it be done?
3120	3124	He will join us or die, master.
3140	3144	I'm sure it's delicious. I just don'tunderstand why we can't see Yoda now.
3144	3147	Patience. For the Jedi,it is time to eat as well.
3151	3153	Eat. Eat.
3153	3155	Hot.
3162	3164	Good food. Good.
3164	3167	How far away is Yoda?Will it take us long to get there?
3167	3169	Not far. Yoda not far.
3169	3172	Patience.Soon you will be with him.
3174	3177	Root leaf. I cook.
3179	3181	Why wish you become Jedi?
3182	3185	Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.
3185	3188	Father.Powerful Jedi was he.
3189	3191	- Powerful Jedi.- Oh, come on.
3192	3194	How could you know my father?You don't even know who I am.
3194	3198	I don't even know what I'm doing here.We're wasting our time!
3199	3201	I cannot teach him.
3201	3203	The boy has no patience.
3204	3206	He will learn patience.
3210	3213	Much anger in him...
3213	3214	like his father.
3215	3218	Was I any differentwhen you taught me?
3219	3220	No.
3221	3224	- He is not ready.- Yoda.
3227	3229	I am ready.
3229	3232	I can be a Jedi.Ben, tell him I'm...
3232	3236	Ready, are you?What know you ready?
3236	3240	For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
3240	3243	My own counsel will I keepon who is to be trained.
3245	3249	A Jedi must havethe deepest commitment...
3249	3251	the most serious mind.
3253	3256	This one a long time have I watched.
3257	3259	All his lifehas he looked away...
3260	3262	to the future,to the horizon.
3263	3266	Never his mind on where he was...
3267	3269	what he was doing.
3271	3272	Adventure.
3273	3275	Excitement.
3275	3277	A Jedi craves not these things.
3278	3280	You are reckless.
3280	3283	So was I, if you remember.
3283	3285	He is too old.
3287	3289	Yes, too old to begin the training.
3289	3291	But I've learned so much.
3298	3301	- Will he finish what he begins?- I won't fail you.
3303	3304	I'm not afraid.
3309	3311	You will be.
3312	3314	You will be.
3354	3357	- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...- I'm not interested in your opinion.
3358	3359	There's something out there.
3360	3361	- Where?- Outside in the cave.
3363	3365	There it is. Listen!
3365	3366	- I'm going out there.- Are you crazy?
3367	3369	I just got this bucket together.I won't let it get torn apart.
3369	3371	Then I'm going with you.
3372	3375	I think it might be betterif I stay behind and guard the ship.
3376	3376	Oh, no.
3391	3393	This ground sure feels strange.
3394	3396	It doesn't feel like rock.
3401	3403	There's an awful lotof moisture in here.
3403	3407	I don't know.I have a bad feeling about this.
3407	3408	Yeah.
3410	3411	Watch out!
3412	3414	It's all right. It's all right.
3415	3417	Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.
3417	3420	Chewie, check the rest of the ship andmake sure there are no more attached...
3420	3422	chewing on the power cables.
3422	3424	Mynocks?
3424	3426	Go inside. We'll clean them offif there are any more.
3435	3437	Go away!Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!
3444	3446	Wait a minute.
3467	3470	- Chewie, let's get out of here!- The Empire is still out there!
3470	3472	No time to discuss thisin committee!
3473	3475	I am not a committee!
3480	3483	You can't make the jump to light speedin this asteroid field.
3483	3485	Sit down, sweetheart.We're taking off.
3490	3491	- Look!- I see it.
3491	3493	- We're doomed!- The cave is collapsing.
3494	3495	- This is no cave.- What?
3526	3528	Yes, run.
3528	3529	Yes.
3530	3533	A Jedi's strengthflows from the Force.
3533	3536	But beware of the dark side.Anger, fear, aggression...
3536	3538	The dark sideof the Force are they.
3538	3542	Easily they flow,quick to join you in a fight.
3542	3544	If once you start downthe dark path...
3544	3546	forever will it dominateyour destiny.
3547	3550	Consume you it will,as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
3550	3552	Vader.
3552	3555	- Is the dark side stronger?- No, no.
3557	3559	Quicker, easier, more seductive.
3560	3562	How am I to knowthe good side from the bad?
3562	3564	You will know...
3564	3566	when you are calm,at peace...
3567	3569	passive.
3570	3574	A Jedi uses the Forcefor knowledge and defence...
3574	3576	never for attack.
3576	3579	- But tell me why I can't...- No. There is no why.
3579	3582	Nothing morewill I teach you today.
3582	3584	Clear your mind of questions.
3606	3608	There's something not right here.
3612	3613	I feel cold.
3614	3615	- Death.- That place...
3616	3620	is strong withthe dark side of the Force.
3620	3622	A domain of evil it is.
3623	3625	In you must go.
3626	3627	What's in there?
3630	3632	Only what you take with you.
3636	3637	Your weapons...
3638	3639	you will not need them.
3793	3796	Bounty hunters.We don't need their scum.
3796	3798	- Yes, sir.- Those rebels won't escape us.
3804	3807	Sir, we have a priority signalfrom the Stardestroyer Avenger.
3807	3809	Right.
3809	3814	There will be a substantial reward forthe one who finds the Millennium Falcon.
3814	3817	You are free to useany methods necessary...
3818	3820	but I want them alive.
3820	3822	No disintegrations.
3822	3824	- As you wish.- Lord Vader.
3826	3828	My lord, we have them.
3832	3835	Thank goodnesswe're coming out of the asteroid field.
3840	3843	Let's get out of here.Ready for light speed?
3843	3845	One, two...
3845	3846	three!
3852	3855	It's not fair.
3856	3859	Transfer circuits aren't working.It's not my fault.
3859	3862	- No light speed?- It's not my fault.
3866	3868	Sir, we just lostthe main rear deflector shield.
3868	3871	One more direct hiton the back quarter and we're done for.
3871	3872	Turn her around.
3872	3875	Turn her around! I'm gonnaput all power in the front shield.
3875	3877	- You're gonna attack?- The odds of surviving...
3877	3879	a direct assaulton an imperial Stardestroyer...
3879	3881	Shut up!
3887	3889	They're moving to attack position.
3891	3892	Shields up.
3899	3901	Track them. They maycome around for another pass.
3901	3903	Captain Needa, the ship no longerappears on our scopes.
3904	3907	They can't have disappeared. No shipthat small has a cloaking device.
3907	3911	- There's no trace of them.- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.
3914	3916	Get a shuttle ready.
3916	3920	I shall assume full responsibility forlosing them and apologize to Lord Vader.
3920	3923	- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.- Yes, Captain Needa.
3927	3929	Use the Force.
3929	3930	Yes.
3936	3937	Now, the stone.
3941	3943	Feel it.
3954	3956	Concentrate!
3970	3973	Oh, no.We'll never get it out now.
3973	3975	So certain are you.
3979	3982	Always with youit cannot be done.
3983	3985	Hear you nothing that I say?
3985	3987	Master, moving stonesaround is one thing.
3987	3989	This is totally different.
3989	3991	No. No different.
3991	3993	Only different in your mind.
3993	3996	You must unlearnwhat you have learned.
3998	4001	- All right. I'll give it a try.- Try not.
4002	4003	Do...
4003	4005	or do not.
4005	4006	There is no try.
4053	4056	I can't. It's too big.
4056	4058	Size matters not.
4058	4061	Look at me.Judge me by my size, do you?
4063	4066	And well you should not...
4066	4069	for my ally is the Force.
4069	4071	And a powerful ally it is.
4072	4075	Life creates it...
4075	4077	makes it grow.
4077	4080	Its energy surrounds us...
4081	4083	and binds us.
4083	4086	Luminous beings are we,not this crude matter.
4087	4090	You must feelthe Force around you.
4091	4094	Here, between you, me...
4094	4097	the tree, the rock...
4097	4099	everywhere.
4099	4100	Yes...
4100	4104	even betweenthe land and the ship.
4109	4111	You want the impossible.
4214	4216	I don't believe it.
4218	4220	That is why you fail.
4239	4242	Apology accepted,Captain Needa.
4250	4253	Lord Vader, our ships have completedtheir scan and found nothing.
4253	4255	If the Millennium Falconwent into light speed...
4255	4257	it'll be on the other sideof the galaxy now.
4257	4259	Alert all commands.
4259	4263	Calculate every possible destinationalong their last known trajectory.
4263	4266	- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.- Don't fail me again...
4267	4269	Admiral.
4271	4274	Alert all commands.Deploy the fleet.
4289	4292	Captain Solo,this time you have gone too far.
4292	4295	I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
4295	4297	The fleet's beginning to break up.
4297	4300	Go stand by the manual releasefor the landing claw.
4302	4304	I really don't seehow that's going to help.
4304	4308	Surrender is a perfectly acceptablealternative in extreme circumstances.
4308	4310	The Empire may begracious enough...
4310	4312	- Thank you.- What did you have in mind next?
4312	4314	If they follow standardimperial procedure...
4314	4316	they'll dump their garbagebefore they go to light speed.
4316	4319	- Then we just float away.- With the rest of the garbage.
4319	4321	Then what?
4321	4324	Then we gotta find a safe portsomewhere around here.
4324	4326	Any ideas?
4326	4328	- Where are we?- The Anoat system.
4328	4331	The Anoat system.There's not much there.
4331	4333	Oh, wait.This is interesting.
4333	4336	- Lando.- Lando system?
4336	4340	Lando's not a system.He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
4340	4342	Card player, gambler.
4342	4345	- A scoundrel. You'd like him.- Thanks.
4345	4347	Bespin. It's pretty far,but I think we can make it.
4349	4352	- A mining colony?- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
4353	4355	Lando conned somebody out of it.
4355	4357	We go back a long way,Lando and me.
4359	4361	- Can you trust him?- No.
4361	4364	But he's got no love for the Empire.I can tell you that.
4365	4368	Here we go, Chewie.Stand by. Detach.
4375	4376	You do have your moments.
4377	4380	Not many of them,but you do have them.
4413	4415	Concentrate.
4415	4418	Feel the Force flow.
4418	4420	Yes.
4427	4429	Good.
4429	4430	Calm.
4430	4432	Yes.
4432	4435	Through the Force,things you will see.
4435	4438	Other places.The future. The past.
4438	4441	Old friends long gone.
4451	4452	Control, control.
4452	4454	You must learn control.
4457	4460	I saw a city in the clouds.
4462	4464	Friends you have there.
4465	4469	- They were in pain.- It is the future you see.
4470	4471	Future?
4480	4481	Will they die?
4484	4486	Difficult to see.
4486	4489	Always in motion is the future.
4491	4492	I've gotta go to them.
4494	4497	Decide you musthow to serve them best.
4497	4500	If you leave now,help them you could...
4501	4504	but you would destroy allfor which they have fought and suffered.
4518	4521	No, I don't have a landing permit.
4521	4524	I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
4524	4526	Wait a minute!Let me explain!
4526	4528	You will not deviatefrom your present course.
4528	4531	- Rather touchy, aren't they?- I thought you knew this person.
4534	4537	That was a long time ago.I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
4545	4548	Permission granted to landon Platform 327.
4548	4550	Thank you.
4551	4553	Nothing to worry about.We go way back, Lando and me.
4553	4555	Who's worried?
4602	4603	No one to meet us.
4605	4607	I don't like this.
4607	4610	- What would you like?- They did let us land.
4610	4612	Look, don't worry.Everything's gonna be fine.
4613	4614	Trust me.
4619	4621	See? My friend.
4625	4627	Keep your eyes open.
4629	4631	Hey.
4631	4635	Why, you slimy, double-crossing,no-good swindler.
4635	4639	You've got a lot of guts coming here,after what you pulled.
4649	4653	How you doin', you old pirate?So good to see you!
4653	4656	- I never thought I'd see you again.- Well, he seems very friendly.
4656	4659	Yes. Very friendly.
4659	4660	What are you doing here?
4661	4662	Repairs. I thoughtyou could help me out.
4663	4665	- What have you done to my ship?- Your ship?
4665	4669	Hey, remember,you lost her to me fair and square.
4669	4671	How you doin', Chewbacca?
4672	4674	Still hanging around with this loser?
4676	4678	Hello.What have we here?
4680	4683	Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.I'm the administrator of this facility.
4683	4686	- And who might you be?- Leia.
4686	4688	Welcome, Leia.
4691	4693	All right, all right.You old smoothie.
4693	4697	Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,human-cyborg relations.
4697	4700	My facilities are at your...Well, really!
4700	4702	- What's wrong with the Falcon?- Hyperdrive.
4702	4704	- I'll get my people to work on her.- Good.
4704	4706	That ship saved my lifequite a few times.
4706	4709	She's the fastesthunk of junk in the galaxy.
4710	4712	How's the gas mine?Still paying off for you?
4713	4716	Not as well as I'd like. We're a smalloutpost and not very self-sufficient.
4716	4719	I've had supply problemsof every kind.
4719	4722	I've had labour difficulties.
4722	4725	- What's so funny?- You. Listen to you.
4725	4728	You sound like a businessman,a responsible leader.
4728	4729	Who'd have thought that, huh?
4730	4732	Seeing you sure brings backa few things.
4733	4734	Yeah.
4734	4736	Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
4737	4739	It's the price you payfor being successful.
4742	4744	Nice to see a familiar face.
4744	4746	How rude!
4748	4749	That sounds likean R2 unit in there.
4750	4751	I wonder if... Hello?
4753	4755	How interesting.
4755	4758	- Who are you?- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.
4758	4760	I didn't mean to intrude.Please don't get up.
4778	4780	Luke, you must complete the training.
4781	4784	I can't keep the vision out of my head.I've gotta help them.
4784	4786	You must not go.
4786	4789	- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.- You don't know that.
4792	4795	Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
4795	4797	But I can help them.I feel the Force.
4797	4799	But you cannot control it.
4800	4802	This is a dangerous time for you...
4802	4805	when you will be temptedby the dark side of the Force.
4805	4808	Yes, yes.To Obi-Wan you listen.
4809	4810	The cave.
4810	4812	Remember your failure at the cave.
4813	4814	But I've learnedso much since then.
4815	4817	Master Yoda, I promise to returnand finish what I've begun.
4817	4819	You have my word.
4819	4822	It is you and your abilitiesthe emperor wants.
4822	4825	That is why your friendsare made to suffer.
4826	4829	That's why I have to go.
4829	4833	Luke, I don't want to lose youto the emperor the way I lost Vader.
4833	4834	You won't.
4835	4839	Stopped they must be.On this all depends.
4840	4843	Only a fully trained Jedi knight,with the Force as his ally...
4843	4845	will conquer Vaderand his emperor.
4846	4848	If you end your training now...
4848	4852	if you choose the quick and easy path,as Vader did...
4852	4854	you will become an agent of evil.
4855	4855	Patience.
4856	4861	- And sacrifice Han and Leia?- If you honour what they fight for...
4861	4862	yes.
4862	4865	If you choose to face Vader,you will do it alone.
4865	4867	I cannot interfere.
4869	4870	I understand.
4875	4878	R2, fire up the converters.
4883	4885	Don't give in to hate.
4885	4888	That leads to the dark side.
4888	4889	Strong is Vader.
4890	4892	Mind what you have learned.Save you it can.
4893	4894	I will.
4894	4897	And I'll return. I promise.
4904	4907	Told you, I did.Reckless is he.
4907	4908	Now...
4908	4910	matters are worse.
4910	4912	That boy is our last hope.
4912	4915	No, there is another.
4946	4949	The ship's almost finished. Two or threemore things and we're in great shape.
4949	4951	The sooner the better.Something's wrong here.
4951	4953	No one has seen or knowsanything about 3PO.
4953	4955	He's been gone too longto have gotten lost.
4956	4957	Relax.
4957	4960	I'll talk to Landoand see what I can find out.
4960	4963	I don't trust Lando.
4963	4966	Well, I don't trust him either,but he is my friend.
4966	4969	Besides, we'll soon be gone.
4970	4972	Then you're as good as gone,aren't you?
5005	5007	What happened?
5008	5009	Where?
5011	5013	Found him in a junk pile?
5013	5015	What a mess.Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5017	5021	- Lando's got people that can fix him.- No, thanks.
5022	5024	I'm sorry.Am I interrupting anything?
5025	5026	Not really.
5029	5031	You look absolutely beautiful.
5031	5034	You truly belong herewith us among the clouds.
5035	5036	Thank you.
5036	5039	Would you join mefor a little refreshment?
5039	5042	Everyone's invited, of course.
5042	5044	Having trouble with your droid?
5044	5046	No. No problem. Why?
5055	5057	You see, since we'rea small operation...
5057	5061	we don't fall intothe jurisdiction of the Empire.
5061	5063	- So you're part of the Mining Guild?- No, not actually.
5063	5065	Our operation is small enoughnot to be noticed.
5065	5067	Which is advantageousfor everybody...
5068	5072	since our customers are anxious to avoidattracting attention to themselves.
5072	5076	Aren't you afraid the Empire'sgonna find out, shut you down?
5076	5079	It's been a danger that looms likea shadow over everything we've built.
5079	5082	But things have developedthat'll ensure security.
5082	5085	I've just made a deal that'll keepthe Empire out of here forever.
5094	5097	We would be honouredif you would join us.
5104	5106	I had no choice.They arrived right before you did.
5107	5108	I'm sorry.
5112	5113	I'm sorry too.
5127	5129	No, 3PO's with them.
5130	5132	Just hang on.We're almost there.
5189	5191	I'm terribly sorry.I didn't mean to intrude.
5191	5193	No, please don't get up.
5199	5202	Stormtroopers? Here?We're in danger.
5202	5205	I must tell the others.Oh, no! I've been shot!
5231	5233	Lord Vader.
5233	5235	You may take Captain Soloto Jabba the Hutt...
5236	5237	after I have Skywalker.
5238	5239	He's no good to me dead.
5240	5243	He will not bepermanently damaged.
5245	5247	Lord Vader, what about Leiaand the Wookiee?
5248	5250	They must never again leave this city.
5250	5253	That wasn't part of our agreement, norwas giving Han to this bounty hunter!
5253	5257	Perhaps you think you'rebeing treated unfairly?
5260	5261	No.
5261	5264	Good. It would be unfortunateif I had to leave a garrison here.
5267	5269	This deal is getting worseall the time.
5270	5272	Oh, yes, that's very good.I like that.
5274	5276	Something's not rightbecause now I can't see.
5279	5281	That's much better.
5281	5283	Wait. Wait.
5283	5285	Oh, my!What have you done?
5285	5286	I'm backwards!
5286	5288	You flea-bitten furball!
5288	5291	Only an overgrown mophead like youwould be stupid enough...
5305	5307	I feel terrible.
5321	5323	Why are they doing this?
5326	5328	They never even asked meany questions.
5337	5339	- Get out of here, Lando.- Shut up and listen.
5340	5342	Vader's agreedto turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5343	5344	They'll have to stay here,but they'll be safe.
5345	5347	- And Han?- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.
5347	5349	- Vader wants us all dead.- He doesn't want you at all.
5349	5352	He's after somebodycalled Skywalker.
5352	5355	- Lord Vader set a trap for him.- And we're the bait.
5355	5357	- He's on his way.- Perfect.
5358	5360	You fixed us all real good,didn't you?
5360	5361	My friend.
5364	5365	Stop!
5366	5368	I've done all I can.
5369	5371	Sorry I couldn't do better,but I got my own problems.
5371	5372	Yeah.
5372	5374	You're a real hero.
5384	5387	You certainlyhave a way with people.
5401	5402	This facility is crude...
5403	5405	but it should be adequateto freeze Skywalker...
5406	5408	for his journey to the emperor.
5408	5411	Lord Vader,ship approaching, X-wing class.
5411	5414	Good. Monitor Skywalkerand allow him to land.
5416	5420	Lord Vader, we only use this facilityfor carbon freezing. It might kill him.
5420	5423	I do not wantthe emperor's prize damaged.
5423	5426	We will test it on Captain Solo.
5449	5453	If you'd attached my legs I wouldn'tbe in this ridiculous position.
5453	5456	Now remember, Chewbacca,you have a responsibility for me...
5456	5457	so don't do anything foolish.
5471	5473	What's going on, buddy?
5474	5476	You're being put into carbon freeze.
5476	5479	What if he doesn't survive?He's worth a lot to me.
5479	5483	The Empire will compensate youif he dies. Put him in.
5486	5488	Chewbacca, stop!
5488	5490	No, Chewie, stop!
5490	5493	You're going to get us all killed!Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.
5493	5495	Hey! Hey!Listen to me.
5495	5497	Chewie, this won't help me.
5497	5500	Hey, save your strength.There'll be another time.
5501	5503	The princess.
5503	5505	You have to take care of her.
5507	5509	Do you hear me?
5522	5525	- I love you.- I know.
5553	5557	What's going on?Turn round. I can't see.
5613	5615	They've encased him in carbonite.
5615	5617	He should be quitewell-protected...
5617	5619	if he survivedthe freezing process, that is.
5619	5621	Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
5621	5623	Yes, he's alive.
5624	5626	And in perfect hibernation.
5627	5629	He's all yours, bounty hunter.
5629	5631	Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5633	5635	Skywalker has just landed, lord.
5635	5639	Good. See to itthat he finds his way in here.
5643	5645	Calrissian...
5645	5647	take the princessand the Wookiee to my ship.
5647	5650	You said they'd be leftunder my supervision.
5650	5652	I am altering the deal.
5652	5654	Pray I don't alter it any further.
5748	5750	Luke, don't! It's a trap!
5751	5753	It's a trap!
5797	5799	The Force is with you,young Skywalker.
5802	5804	But you are not a Jedi yet.
5863	5865	Well done.
5866	5869	Hold them in the security tower.And keep it quiet.
5869	5871	Move.
5875	5878	- What do you think you're doing?- We're getting out of here.
5878	5880	I knew all along.It had to be a mistake.
5880	5883	Do you think thatafter what you did to Han...
5884	5887	- I had no choice.- What are you doing? Trust him!
5887	5890	We understand, don't we, Chewie?He had no choice.
5890	5892	I'm just trying to help.
5892	5894	We don't need any of your help.
5899	5901	What?
5901	5905	- It sounds like Han.- There's still a chance to save Han...
5906	5909	at the east... platform.
5913	5915	I'm terribly sorry about all this.
5915	5917	After all, he's only a Wookiee.
5918	5920	Put Captain Soloin the cargo hold.
5935	5937	R2, where have you been?
5937	5939	Wait. Turn around, you woolly...
5940	5943	Hurry! We're trying to saveHan from the bounty hunter.
5946	5948	Well, at leastyou're still in one piece.
5948	5950	Look what's happened to me.
5962	5964	Oh, no!Chewie, they're behind you!
5977	5979	You have learned much, young one.
5979	5981	You'll find I'm full of surprises.
5992	5995	Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
5996	5998	Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
6006	6007	All too easy.
6012	6015	Perhaps you're not as strongas the emperor thought.
6018	6019	Impressive.
6021	6023	Most impressive.
6030	6034	Obi-Wan has taught you well.You have controlled your fear.
6036	6039	Now, release your anger.
6040	6042	Only your hatred can destroy me.
6168	6170	The security codehas been changed.
6170	6173	R2, you can tell the computerto override the security systems.
6174	6175	R2, hurry.
6179	6181	Attention.This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.
6181	6183	The Empire has taken controlof the city.
6183	6186	I advise everyone to leavebefore more imperial troops arrive.
6192	6193	This way.
6193	6196	Well, don't blame me.I'm an interpreter.
6196	6198	I'm not supposed to know a power socketfrom a computer terminal.
6219	6222	We're not interested in the hyperdriveon the Falcon. It's fixed!
6227	6229	Just open the door,you stupid lump!
6238	6240	I never doubted you for a second.Wonderful!
6264	6266	That hurts! Bend down,you thoughtless... Ow!
6273	6274	Go!
6280	6283	I thought that hairy beastwould be the end of me.
6283	6285	Of course I've looked better.
6337	6340	You are beaten.It is useless to resist.
6340	6344	Don't let yourself be destroyedas Obi-Wan did.
6359	6360	There is no escape.
6361	6363	Don't make me destroy you.
6367	6370	You do not yet realizeyour importance.
6370	6372	You have only begunto discover your power.
6372	6374	Join me...
6374	6377	and I will complete your training.
6377	6379	With our combined strength...
6379	6382	we can endthis destructive conflict...
6382	6384	and bring order to the galaxy.
6384	6387	I'll never join you!
6387	6391	If you only knew the powerof the dark side.
6391	6395	Obi-Wan never told youwhat happened to your father.
6395	6396	He told me enough.
6399	6401	He told me you killed him.
6402	6404	I am your father.
6413	6414	That's not true.
6415	6417	That's impossible!
6417	6420	Search your feelings.You know it to be true.
6429	6433	You can destroy the emperor.He has foreseen this.
6433	6435	It is your destiny.
6436	6437	Join me...
6437	6441	and together we can rule the galaxyas father and son.
6452	6453	Come with me.
6454	6456	It is the only way.
6520	6521	Ben.
6522	6524	Ben, please.
6550	6552	Hear me.
6559	6561	- We've got to go back.- What?
6561	6563	- I know where Luke is.- What about those fighters?
6564	6566	Chewie, just do it.
6566	6568	All right, all right!
6576	6580	Alert my Stardestroyerto prepare for my arrival.
6590	6592	Look, someone's up there.
6593	6595	It's Luke.Chewie, slow down.
6595	6599	We'll get under him.Lando, open the top hatch.
6614	6616	Okay. Easy, Chewie.
6637	6639	- Lando?- Okay, let's go.
6658	6660	All right, Chewie. Let's go.
6694	6696	I'll be back.
6701	6702	Stardestroyer.
6707	6710	All right, Chewie.Ready for light speed.
6710	6712	If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
6712	6714	All the coordinates are set.It's now or never.
