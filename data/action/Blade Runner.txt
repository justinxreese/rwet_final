312	313	Oh, sorry.

330	331	That's the hotel.
331	333	-What?-Where I live.
333	335	-Nice place?-Yeah, sure, I guess.
335	337	Is that part of the test?
337	340	No. Just warming you up. That's all.
340	343	It's not fancy or anything.
344	346	You're in a desert,walking along in the sand, when--
347	348	Is this the test, now?
348	350	Yes. You're in a desert,walking along in the sand...
350	352	-...when you look down---What one?
352	354	-What?-What desert?
354	357	Doesn't make any difference.It's completely hypothetical.
357	360	-But how come I'd be there?-Maybe you're fed up.
360	362	Maybe you wanna be by yourself.Who knows?
363	364	You look down and see a tortoise.
365	368	-It's crawling towards you---Tortoise? What's that?
371	374	-You know what a turtle is?-Of course.
374	375	Same thing.
376	377	I've never seen a turtle.
380	381	But I understand what you mean.
382	384	You reach down,you flip the tortoise over on its back.
384	387	Do you make up these questions,Mr. Holden?
387	389	Or do they write them down for you?
389	392	The tortoise lays on its back,its belly baking in the sun...
392	395	...beating its legs,trying to turn itself over, but it can't...
396	397	...not without your help.
397	399	-You're not helping.-What do you mean I'm not?
400	401	I mean, you're not helping.
402	403	Why is that, Leon?
411	414	They're just questions, Leon.
414	417	In answer to your query,they're written down for me.
417	422	It's a test designed to provokean emotional response.
424	426	Shall we continue?
427	431	Describe in single words only thegood things that come into your mind...
432	434	...about your mother.
434	436	-My mother?-Yeah.

510	513	...designed especially for your needs.
513	517	So come on, America.Let's put out....

683	684	Bryant.
684	688	You wouldn't have comeif I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.
689	693	Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.
710	713	They jumped a shuttle Off-world,killed the crew and passengers.
713	716	They found the shuttle driftingoff the coast two weeks ago...
716	718	...so we know they're around.
719	721	Embarrassing.
721	724	No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's evergonna find out they're down here.
724	727	Because you're gonna spot themand air them out.
727	728	I don't work here anymore.
730	731	Give it to Holden.
731	733	-He's good.-I did.
734	736	He can breathe okayas long as nobody unplugs him.
737	740	He's not good enough.Not good as you.
740	742	I need you, Deck.
742	744	Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.
745	747	I need the old Blade Runner.
747	749	I need your magic.
750	753	I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.
754	756	I'm twice as quit now.
756	759	Stop right where you are.You know the score, pal?
760	762	If you're not cop, you're little people.
774	775	No choice, huh?
777	779	No choice, pal.
779	782	I already had an IQ test this year.
782	784	I don 't think I've everhad one of these.
785	787	Reaction time is a factor,so please pay attention.
787	789	-Answer as quickly as you can.-Yeah, sure.
790	793	1187 at Hunterwasser.
793	794	Yeah. That's the hotel.
794	797	-What?-Where I live.
797	799	-Nice place?-Yeah, sure, I guess.
799	802	There was an escape fromthe Off-world colonies two weeks ago.
802	805	Six Replicants: three male, three female.
805	807	They slaughtered 23 peopleand jumped a shuttle.
808	810	An aerial patrol spottedthe ship off the coast.
810	812	No crew, no sight of them.
812	815	Three nights ago they tried to breakinto Tyrell Corporation.
815	818	Two of them got fried runningthrough an electrical field.
818	820	We lost the others.
821	824	On the possibility they might tryto infiltrate as employees...
825	829	...I had Holden go over and runVoight-Kampff tests on the new workers.
829	831	Looks like he got himself one.
831	835	So you look down and you seea tortoise. It's crawling towards you.
835	836	-Tortoise?-That's Leon.
836	838	Ammunition loaderon intergalactic runs.
838	842	He can lift 400-pound atomic loadsall day and night.
842	844	The only way you can hurt himis to kill him.
844	849	I don't get it. What do they risk comingback to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?
849	852	What do they wantout of the Tyrell Corporation?
852	855	Well, you tell me, pal.That's what you're here for.
866	869	-What's this?-Nexus 6. Roy Batty.
870	872	lncept date: 201 6.
872	875	Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.
876	878	Probably the leader.
881	883	This is Zhora.

898	901	The standard item for military clubsin the outer colonies.
903	907	They were designed to copy human beingsin every way except their emotions.
907	909	The designers reckonedafter a few years...
910	912	...they might developtheir own emotional responses.
913	916	Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
916	918	So they built in a fail-safe device.
918	922	-Which is what?-Four-year lifespan.
928	931	Now, there's a Nexus 6over at the Tyrell Corporation.
931	936	-I want you to go put the machine on it.-And if the machine doesn't work?
1027	1028	Do you like our owl?
1032	1034	It's artificial?
1035	1036	Of course it is.
1038	1039	Must be expensive.
1041	1044	Very. I'm Rachael.
1045	1046	Deckard.
1048	1052	It seems you feel our workis not a benefit to the public.
1053	1058	Replicants are like any other machine:They're either a benefit or a hazard.
1058	1060	If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
1061	1063	May I ask you a personal question?
1065	1067	Sure.
1071	1073	Have you ever retired a humanby mistake?
1076	1077	No.
1077	1081	-But in your position, that is a risk.-Is this to be an empathy test?
1082	1085	Capillary dilationof the so-called blush response?
1086	1089	Fluctuation of the pupil.
1090	1093	Involuntary dilation of the iris.
1095	1097	We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
1098	1100	Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
1101	1103	Demonstrate it.
1104	1105	I wanna see it work.
1105	1108	-Where's the subject?-I wanna see it work on a person.
1108	1111	I wanna see a negativebefore I provide you with a positive.
1111	1113	What's that gonna prove?
1114	1116	Indulge me.
1116	1117	On you?
1118	1119	Try her.
1124	1127	It's too bright in here.
1164	1165	Do you mind if I smoke?
1167	1168	It won't affect the test.
1170	1173	All right, I'm gonna ask youa series of questions.
1173	1177	Just relax and answer themas simply as you can.
1184	1188	It's your birthday.Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
1188	1190	I wouldn't accept it.
1190	1194	Also, I'd report the personwho gave it to me to the police.
1195	1199	You've got a little boy.He shows you his butterfly collection...
1199	1201	...plus the killing jar.
1204	1206	I'd take him to the doctor.
1212	1213	You're watching television.
1213	1216	Suddenly you realizethere's a wasp crawling on your arm.
1216	1218	I'd kill it.
1221	1225	You're reading a magazine. You comeacross a full-page nude photo of a girl.
1225	1228	Is this testing whether I'm a Replicantor a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?
1228	1231	Just answer the questions, please.
1235	1237	You show it to your husband.
1237	1239	He likes it so muchhe hangs it on your bedroom wall.
1240	1241	--bush outside your window?
1241	1243	I wouldn't let him.
1243	1244	--orange body, green legs?
1244	1246	Why not?
1246	1248	I should be enough for him.
1252	1254	One more question.
1255	1258	You're watching a stage play,a banquet is in progress.
1258	1262	The guests are enjoyingan appetizer of raw oysters.
1262	1265	The entr√©e consists of boiled dog.
1282	1284	Would you step outfor a few moments, Rachael?
1294	1296	Thank you.
1297	1299	She's a Replicant, isn't she?
1299	1301	I'm impressed.
1301	1304	How many questionsdoes it usually take to spot one?
1304	1307	-I don't get it, Tyrell.-How many questions?
1307	1310	Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
1310	1312	It took more than a hundred for Rachael,didn't it?
1313	1314	She doesn't know.
1315	1316	She's beginning to suspect, I think.
1317	1319	Suspect?How can it not know what it is?
1319	1322	Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.
1322	1324	"More human than human" is our motto.
1325	1328	Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.
1328	1333	We began to recognize in thema strange obsession.
1333	1337	After all, they are emotionallyinexperienced, with only a few years...
1337	1340	...in which to store up the experienceswhich you and I take for granted.
1340	1346	If we gift them with a past, we createa cushion or a pillow for their emotions...
1346	1349	...then consequentlywe can control them better.
1349	1351	Memories.
1351	1353	You're talking about memories.
1363	1366	Reaction time is a factor,so please pay attention.
1366	1368	-Now answer as quickly as you can.-Sure.
1368	1371	- 1187 at Hunterwasser.-Yeah. That's the hotel.
1371	1372	-What?-Where I live.
1372	1374	-Nice place?-Yeah, sure, I guess.
1374	1376	-Is that part of the test?-No.
1406	1408	Kowalski.
1516	1518	Time...
1518	1519	...enough.
1537	1540	Did you get your precious photos?
1543	1545	Someone was there.
1546	1548	Men?
1552	1555	Policemen?
1647	1650	Fiery the angels fell
1650	1654	Deep thunder rolled around their shores
1654	1657	Burning with the fires of Orc
1660	1664	You not come here! Illegal!
1667	1668	Hey! Hey!

1904	1906	I don't know whyhe told you what he did.
1906	1907	Talk to him.
1908	1910	He wouldn't see me.
1922	1924	You want a drink?
1927	1928	No?
1935	1937	You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?
1943	1945	Look.
1945	1948	It's me with my mother.
1949	1951	Yeah?
1957	1960	Remember when you were 6?
1960	1963	You and your brother snuck into an emptybuilding through a basement window.
1964	1966	You were gonna play doctor?
1967	1970	He showed you his, and when it gotto be your turn, you chickened and ran.
1971	1972	Remember that?
1974	1979	Did you ever tell anybody that?Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?
1981	1984	You remember the spider that livedin the bush outside your window?

3045	3046	Hello?
3048	3052	I've had people walk out on me before,but not when...
3052	3054	...I was being so charming.
3054	3058	I'm in a bar, here now,down in the Fourth Sector.
3060	3061	Taffey Lewis is on the line.
3061	3064	Why don't you come on down hereand have a drink?
3065	3067	I don 't think so, Mr. Deckard.
3068	3070	That's not my kind of place.
3070	3071	Go someplace else?
3087	3090	Ladies and gentlemen...
3090	3095	...Taffey Lewis presentsMiss Salome and the snake.
3095	3100	Watch her take the pleasurefrom the serpent...
3100	3104	...that once corrupted man.
3146	3149	Excuse me, Miss Salome,can I talk to you for a minute?
3149	3153	I'm from the American Federationof Variety Artists.
3153	3154	Oh, yeah?
3154	3158	I'm not here to make you join.No, ma'am. That's not my department.
3158	3160	Actually...
3162	3167	...I'm from the Confidential Committeeon Moral Abuses.
3168	3170	Committee of Moral Abuses?
3170	3172	There's been reportsthat the management...
3172	3174	...has been taking libertieswith the artists.
3174	3176	I don't know nothing about it.
3176	3179	Have you felt yourself to beexploited in any way?
3179	3182	How do you mean "exploited"?
3182	3184	Well, like to get this job.
3185	3189	I mean, did you do, or were youasked to do, anything that's...
3190	3192	...lewd or unsavory or...
3192	3196	...otherwise repulsiveto your person, huh?
3199	3201	-Are you for real?-Oh, yeah.
3202	3205	I'd like to checkyour dressing room, if I may.
3205	3208	-For what?-For holes.
3208	3209	Holes?
3209	3212	Well, you'd be surprisedwhat a guy would go through...
3212	3215	...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
3218	3219	No, I wouldn't.
3219	3222	Little...
3222	3227	...dirty holes they drill in the wallso they can watch a lady undress.
3261	3264	-Is this a real snake?-Of course it's not real.
3264	3268	Think I'd be working in a place like thisif I could afford a real snake?
3282	3285	So if somebody does try to exploit me,who do I go to about it?
3285	3290	-Me.-You're a dedicated man. Dry me.
3316	3318	The only thing they care about--
3318	3319	Hey!

3580	3582	Move on. Move on.
3582	3585	Move on. Move on.

3595	3596	Yeah, what do you want?
3597	3598	Tsingtao.
3606	3607	This enough?
3608	3609	Yeah.
3618	3620	Bryant.
3640	3643	Christ, Deckard, you look almost as badas that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.
3644	3645	I'm going home.
3645	3647	Could learn from this guy, Gaff.
3647	3650	He's a goddamn one-manslaughterhouse, that's what he is.
3651	3652	Four more to go.
3653	3654	-Come on, Gaff, let's go.-Three.
3657	3658	There's three to go.
3658	3661	There's four.
3661	3664	That skin-job you VK'dat the Tyrell Corporation...
3664	3668	...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.Didn't even know she was a Replicant.
3668	3671	Something to do with a brain implant,says Tyrell.
3671	3674	Come on, Gaff.Drink some for me, huh, pal?
3719	3720	Leon.
3720	3722	How old am I?
3726	3728	I don't know.
3730	3733	My birthday's April 10, 2017.How long do I live?
3734	3735	Four years.
3742	3744	More than you.
3749	3751	Painful to live in fear, isn't it?
3757	3760	Nothing is worse than havingan itch you can never scratch.
3761	3763	I agree.
3774	3776	Wake up. Time to die.
3811	3813	Shakes?
3814	3816	Me too.
3820	3822	I get them bad.
3827	3829	It's part of the business.
3837	3838	I'm not in the business.
3852	3854	I am the business.
3947	3948	What if I go north?
3952	3953	Disappear.
3959	3960	Would you come after me?
3962	3964	Hunt me?
3969	3970	No.
3973	3975	No, I wouldn't.
3981	3982	I owe you one.
3997	3999	But somebody would.
4012	4013	Deckard...
4016	4018	...you know those files on me?
4019	4023	The incept date. The longevity.
4023	4025	Those things.
4027	4028	You saw them?
4032	4034	They're...
4034	4035	...classified.
4035	4038	But you're a policeman.
4038	4040	I...
4040	4042	...didn't look at them.
4044	4046	You know,that Voight-Kampff test of yours...
4047	4050	...did you ever take that test yourself?
4062	4064	Deckard.
4214	4216	I dreamt music.
4221	4224	I didn't know if I could play.
4225	4228	I remember lessons.
4229	4233	I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
4238	4240	You play beautifully.
4310	4312	Now you kiss me.
4314	4315	I can't rely on my--
4315	4318	Say, "Kiss me."
4321	4323	Kiss me.
4334	4336	I want you.
4339	4341	I want you.
4341	4342	Again.
4343	4345	I want you.
4348	4350	Put your hands on me.
4432	4435	-What you doing?-I'm sorry. Just peeking.
4439	4442	-How do I look?-You look better.
4442	4445	-Just better?-Well...
4446	4447	...you look beautiful.
4451	4452	Thanks.
4459	4460	How old are you?
4462	4464	Twenty-five.
4465	4468	-What's your problem?-Methuselah syndrome.
4468	4469	What's that?
4469	4472	My glands, they grow old too fast.
4473	4478	-Is that why you're still on Earth?-Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.
4481	4482	Anyway...
4482	4483	...I kind of like it here.
4486	4488	I like you...
4488	4490	...just the way you are.
4493	4495	Hi, Roy.
4495	4496	Hi.
4496	4498	Gosh, you...
4498	4501	...really got some nice toys here.
4501	4503	This is the friend I was telling you about.
4503	4506	This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.
4507	4508	Sebastian.
4509	4512	I like a man that stays put.
4513	4516	You live here all by yourself, do you?
4517	4518	Yes.
4529	4531	How about some breakfast?
4532	4534	I was just gonna make some.
4534	4535	Excuse me.
4542	4544	Well?
4546	4547	Leon... .
4548	4550	What's going on?
4554	4556	There's only two of us now.
4558	4561	Then we're stupid and we'll die.
4565	4567	No, we won't.
4601	4602	No.
4602	4604	Knight takes queen, see?
4604	4606	Won't do.
4615	4617	Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?
4617	4618	Because...
4619	4621	...you're so different.
4622	4624	You're so perfect.
4627	4629	Yes.
4629	4631	What generation are you?
4640	4641	Nexus 6.
4642	4643	I knew it.
4643	4647	Because I do genetic design workfor the Tyrell Corporation.
4647	4649	There's some of me in you.
4650	4652	Show me something.
4652	4654	Like what?
4654	4656	Like anything.
4658	4662	We're no computers, Sebastian.We're physical.
4664	4666	I think, Sebastian...
4667	4669	...therefore, I am.
4669	4673	Very good, Pris. Now show him why.
4699	4701	We've got a lot in common.
4701	4704	-What do you mean?-Similar problems.
4704	4707	Accelerated decrepitude.
4708	4711	I don't know much about bio-mechanics,Roy. I wish I did.
4713	4716	If we don't find help soon...
4716	4719	...Pris hasn't got long to live.
4719	4721	We can't allow that.
4723	4726	-Is he good?-Who?
4726	4730	-Your opponent.-Oh, Dr. Tyrell?
4730	4733	I've only beaten him once in chess.He's a genius.
4736	4737	He designed you.
4739	4742	Maybe he could help.
4742	4744	I'd be happy to mention it to him.
4746	4750	Better if I talk to him in person.
4753	4758	But I understandhe's a sort of hard man to get to.
4758	4760	Yes.
4760	4762	Very.
4765	4767	Will you help us?
4768	4769	I can't.
4770	4772	We need you, Sebastian.
4772	4775	You're our best and only friend.
4788	4790	We're so happy you found us.
4792	4794	I don't thinkthere's another human being...
4794	4797	...in the whole worldwho would've helped us.
4846	4849	66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.
4850	4852	Trade.
4852	4855	-Trade at two---Blue entry.
4856	4859	A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.
4859	4863	16417.
4864	4866	At this hour?
4866	4869	What can I do for you, Sebastian?
4872	4874	Queen to bishop six. Check.
4879	4882	Nonsense.
4882	4884	Just a moment.
4887	4892	Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.
4897	4899	Queen...
4901	4903	...bishop six.
4908	4910	Knight...
4910	4913	... takes queen.
4919	4922	What's on your mind, Sebastian?
4922	4923	What are you thinking about?
4925	4927	Bishop to king seven.
4927	4929	Checkmate.
4930	4932	Bishop to king seven.Checkmate, I think.
4934	4937	Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?
4937	4940	Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?
4940	4942	Let's discuss this.
4942	4944	You better come up, Sebastian.
4962	4964	Mr. Tyrell?
4966	4967	I...
4968	4970	I brought a friend.
4976	4980	I'm surprisedyou didn't come here sooner.
4986	4990	It's not an easy thingto meet your maker.
4990	4993	And what can he do for you?
4994	4997	Can the maker repair what he makes?
4998	5001	Would you like to be modified?
5001	5003	Stay here.
5008	5012	Had in mind somethinga little more radical.
5012	5014	What...?
5014	5017	What seems to be the problem?
5017	5020	-Death.-Death.
5021	5024	Well, I'm afraid that'sa little out of my jurisdiction. You--
5024	5027	I want more life...
5027	5028	...father.
5033	5035	The facts of life.
5037	5039	To make an alteration in the...
5040	5042	...evolvement ofan organic life system is fatal.
5042	5046	A coding sequence cannot be revisedonce it's been established.
5046	5047	Why not?
5047	5049	Because by the second dayof incubation...
5049	5054	...any cells that have undergonereversion mutations...
5054	5058	...give rise to revertant colonieslike rats leaving a sinking ship.
5058	5060	Then the ship sinks.
5060	5064	What about EMS recombination?
5064	5066	We've already tried it.
5066	5070	Ethyl methane sulfonate is analkylating agent and a potent mutagen.
5070	5074	It created a virus so lethal the...
5075	5077	...subject was deadbefore he left the table.
5077	5080	Then a repressor proteinthat blocks the operating cells.
5080	5084	Wouldn't obstruct replication, but itdoes give rise to an error in replication.
5084	5089	So that the newly formed DNA strandcarries a mutation...
5089	5092	...and you've got a virus again.
5092	5097	But this, all of this, is...
5097	5098	...academic.
5099	5101	You were madeas well as we could make you.
5101	5103	But not to last.
5104	5107	The light that burns twice as brightburns half as long.
5107	5111	And you have burnedso very, very brightly, Roy.
5112	5114	Look at you.
5114	5117	You're the prodigal son.
5117	5120	You're quite a prize.
5126	5127	I've done...
5128	5129	...questionable things.
5129	5131	Also extraordinary things.
5132	5134	Revel in your time.
5138	5143	Nothing the god of biomechanicswouldn't let you in heaven for.
5195	5198	Sorry, Sebastian.
5198	5201	Come. Come.
5248	5252	Body identified with Tyrellis a 25-year-old male Caucasian.
5253	5255	Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.
5256	5260	Address: Bradbury Apartments,Ninth Sector, NF4675 1.
5261	5262	I want you to go down there and--
5266	5269	This sector's closed to ground traffic.What're you doing here?
5269	5273	-I'm working. What are you doing?-Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.
5273	5278	I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.26354. I'm filed and monitored.
5278	5279	Hold on. Checking.
5284	5287	Okay. Checked and cleared.Have a better one.
5298	5300	-Hello.-Hi. Is J.F. there?
5300	5303	-Who is it?-This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.
5307	5309	That's no way to treat a friend.
5488	5490	Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.
5491	5494	Good evening, J.F.
5504	5506	Tea?
5507	5509	More tea?
5510	5511	Tea?
5521	5523	More tea?
5525	5526	Tea?
5528	5530	More tea?
5532	5534	More tea?
5546	5548	More tea?
5733	5737	Not very sporting to fireon an unarmed opponent.
5739	5742	I thought you weresupposed to be good.
5743	5746	Aren't you the good man?
5751	5755	Come on, Deckard.
5756	5758	Show me...
5759	5761	...what you're made of.
5773	5775	Proud of yourself, little man?
5782	5784	This is for Zhora.
5786	5787	This is for Pris.
5794	5796	Come on, Deckard.
5796	5800	I'm right here,but you've gotta shoot straight.
5801	5803	Straight doesn't seemto be good enough!
5803	5805	Now it's my turn.
5806	5810	I'm gonna give you a few secondsbefore I come.
5811	5812	One.
5812	5814	Two.
5826	5828	Three.
5829	5830	Four.
5843	5844	Pris.
5915	5919	I'm coming.
5920	5921	Deckard!
5924	5925	Four, five
5928	5931	How to stay alive?
5954	5956	I can see you!
5982	5984	Not yet!
5984	5985	Not... .
6018	6020	Five.
6023	6025	Five.
6029	6030	Yes.
6038	6039	You better get it up.
6040	6042	Or I'm gonna have to kill you.
6043	6045	Unless you're alive, you can't play.
6045	6047	And if you don't play... .
6057	6059	Six, seven
6059	6061	Go to hell or go to heaven
6068	6070	Good, that's the spirit!
6111	6114	That hurt.
6117	6119	That was irrational of you.
6121	6122	Not to mention...
6123	6125	...unsportsmanlike.
6129	6131	Where are you going?
6316	6320	Quite an experience to live in fear,isn't it?
6321	6324	That's what it is to be a slave.
6383	6385	I've...
6385	6390	...seen thingsyou people wouldn't believe.
6391	6397	Attack ships on fireoff the shoulder of Orion.
6399	6401	I watched C-beams...
6401	6405	...glitter in the darknear the Tannh√§user Gate.
6409	6411	All those...
6411	6414	...moments will be lost...
6414	6417	...in time...
6418	6420	...like...
6421	6422	...tears...
6424	6426	...in rain.
6430	6432	Time to die.
6498	6501	You've done a man's job, sir.
6507	6509	I guess you're through, huh?
6511	6513	Finished.
6535	6538	It's too bad she won't live.
6539	6541	But then again, who does?
6575	6577	Rachael?
6585	6586	Rachael?
6600	6602	Rachael?
6669	6670	Do you love me?
6672	6673	I love you.
6674	6676	Do you trust me?
