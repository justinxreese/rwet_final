154	155	Teacher...
158	162	I see your talents have gonebeyond the mere physical level.
163	166	Your skills are now at the pointof spiritual insight.
168	169	I have several questions:
169	172	What is the highest techniqueyou hope to achieve?
172	174	- To have no technique.- Very good.
175	177	What are your thoughtswhen facing an opponent?
177	179	There is no opponent.
179	181	And why is that?
181	183	Because the word "l" does not exist.
185	187	So, continue.
189	191	A good fight should be...
193	196	...like a small play, but played seriously.
199	202	A good martial artist does notbecome tense, but ready.
204	206	Not thinking, yet not dreaming.
208	210	Ready for whatever may come.
210	213	When the opponent expands, I contract.
214	216	When he contracts, I expand.
216	218	When there is an opportunity...
220	221	...I do not hit.
223	225	It hits all by itself.
226	228	Now, you must remember...
229	232	...the enemy has only imagesand illusions...
233	236	...behind which he hides his true motives.
237	240	Destroy the image,and you will break the enemy.
240	243	The hit that you refer to...
244	246	...is a powerful weapon...
246	250	...easily misused by the martial artistwho deserts his vows.
253	254	For centuries now...
255	258	...the code of the Shaolin Templehas been preserved.
258	259	Remember...
259	262	...the honor of our brotherhoodhas been held true.
265	267	Tell me now the Shaolin CommandmentNumber 13.
269	273	"A martial artist hasto take responsibility for himself...
273	276	"...and to accept the consequencesof his own doing."
280	282	I'm ashamed to tell you now.
283	285	Among all the Shaolin men I have taught...
287	291	...there is one who has turnedthe ways of knowledge and strength...
291	293	...to his own base ends.
295	297	He has perverted all we held sacred.
299	301	His name is Han.
303	305	In defiance of all our beliefs...
309	311	...he has brought disgraceto the Shaolin Temple.
313	316	So, it is now for you to reclaimour lost honor.
318	320	Yes, I understand.
322	324	There is a man here. You will go to him.
334	336	Hello, Mr. Lee. My name is Braithwaite.
336	338	Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.
339	343	I've come to speak to youabout a matter of great importance.
343	345	- Have some tea?- Yes, indeed.
350	351	This is very pleasant.
361	364	I've come to speak to youabout a tournament of martial arts.
365	368	A tournament to whichyou've already received an invitation.
368	371	Specifically, a tournament organizedby Mr. Han.
373	375	Han's tournament.
375	376	I know, I know...
377	381	...but we'd like you to attendthat particular tournament, Mr. Lee.
382	383	"We," Mr. Braithwaite?
386	388	It's Lahn's time.
389	390	Yes, of course.
403	404	Kick me.
406	407	Kick me.
416	417	What was that?
417	419	An exhibition?
419	421	We need emotional content.
425	426	Try again.
438	440	I said, "emotional content"...
440	442	...not anger!
442	444	Now try again with meaning!
456	457	That's it!
459	461	How did it feel to you?
463	464	Let me think.
466	467	Don't think! Feel!
469	472	It is like a finger pointing a wayto the moon.
474	478	Don't concentrate on the fingeror you will miss...
478	481	...all that heavenly glory.
483	484	Do you understand?
489	491	Never take your eyes off your opponent.
491	493	Even when you bow.
495	496	That's it.
640	641	There!
642	645	That's Han. That's the only filmwe have on him.
646	649	We know that he was a memberof your temple. A Shaolin monk...
649	651	...now a renegade.
653	656	That's Oharra behind him.Personal bodyguard.
656	660	Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,being Han's bodyguard.
662	665	We got our hands on a demonstration filmof Oharra.
665	669	All real bricks and boards.Nothing phony about any of it.
669	673	This was before he picked upa facial scar somewhere.
684	686	This is where you'll be going.
687	689	An island fortress, really.
690	691	After the war...
692	695	...the nationality of the islandwas uncertain.
696	699	And sometime after that, Han bought it.
700	701	What do you know about Han?
702	706	He lives like a king on that island,totally self-sufficient.
707	709	All of his efforts, seemingly...
709	714	...are directed towards supportingwhat he calls his school of martial arts.
715	719	Han's only contact with the outside worldis this tournament...
719	721	...which he holds every three years.
722	726	This was a stewardess, Mary King,found floating in the harbor.
726	729	Nothing unusualabout a body in the harbor.
729	733	But this girl was last seen at a partyaboard Han's private junk.
734	737	They had reported her lost at seabefore the body was found.
738	740	We believe he selects attractive girls...
740	742	...methodically buildstheir dependence on drugs...
742	746	...then sells them to an elite clientelearound the world.
746	749	What did the autopsy revealas the cause of death?
749	751	She did not drown.
751	752	She OD'd?
758	759	Yes.
759	762	Cause of death was a heroin overdose.
763	767	I gather you still don't have enoughto bust up his operation.
767	769	We know everything.We can prove nothing.
772	774	We want you to go in there as our agent.
774	776	Get us our evidence.
776	779	And come out in one pieceto give it to you.
780	782	We'll give you anything you need.
782	785	Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.Drink?
786	787	No, thanks.
788	789	Guns!
789	793	Now, why doesn't somebody pull a.45,and bang, settle it?
794	795	No. No guns.
797	798	Look at this map here.
800	805	As you know, the possession of a weaponis a serious offense here.
806	809	Han's island rests partlywithin our territorial waters.
811	815	If we were given any reason to believethat he has any kind of arsenal...
816	817	...we'd move in on him.
817	821	Besides, Han would never allow gunson the island, anyway.
821	825	He had a bad experience with them onceand he's fearful of assassination.
826	830	Can't really blame him.Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.
831	833	I guess I won't need anything.
833	835	There's a radio on the island.
835	838	We'll be monitoring it on the chancethat you can get to it.
839	840	And then you'll come?
841	843	Someone will.
843	846	We aren't an agency of enforcement.
846	849	We function as gatherers of information.
849	853	Evidence upon whichinterested governments can act.
853	855	I see.
855	858	If there's any trouble,you make a phone call.
858	859	Oh, by the way...
860	864	...two months ago, we managed to placea female operative on the island.
865	867	Since then, we've lost her.
868	870	If she's still there,she might have something.
870	872	Her name is Mei Ling.
873	875	Are you sure you won't have one?
875	876	No, thanks.
916	920	Now the time has cometo tell you something very difficult.
921	924	I am happy you have decidedto go to Han's tournament.
926	927	Yeah.
928	932	The last of the tournaments was heldthree years ago.
933	935	I was in the city with your sister...
936	937	...at that time.
940	942	I didn't know that.
945	949	Many of Han's men had come infrom the island.
949	952	They were everywhere,bullying and arrogant.
953	956	We were on our way into town.
984	985	Stay back!
989	990	Run!
1196	1198	Now you know the truth.
1199	1201	When you get to the city...
1201	1205	...pay your respects to your sisterand your mother.
1211	1212	I will, old man.
1232	1235	You will not agreewith what I am going to do.
1237	1239	It is contrary to allthat you have taught me.
1243	1245	And all that Su Ling believed.
1255	1256	I must leave.
1260	1263	Please try to find a way to forgive me.
1329	1330	Double or nothing?
1332	1334	That's about $1,000 a foot, Roper!
1336	1337	Why not?
1354	1358	I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.May I take a message?
1382	1384	That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.
1389	1391	Excuse me, fellows.
1392	1394	I say you can't make it.
1394	1395	What will you bet?
1396	1398	You've got to love him.
1398	1401	Come on, Roper, it's 175 big onesby Monday, the 15th.
1403	1404	Only 150.
1406	1408	You forget the interest.
1408	1410	Well, maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
1410	1412	You take advantage, Roper.
1413	1414	Come on, fellows.
1414	1417	It's the dough, Roper,or we gotta break something.
1419	1420	You got it?
1423	1426	Freddie says this is for your own good.
1449	1452	Better confirm that flightto Hong Kong for me.
1453	1456	How much do I have left in the bank?
1456	1457	$63.43.
1459	1460	It's all yours.
1460	1461	Thanks!
1462	1464	Only, I think you'll need it.
1464	1466	You want to bet?
1592	1594	Going on a trip, are you?
1603	1605	This jig's got a passport!
1606	1607	Where are you going, jig?
1609	1610	Where's the plane ticket for?
1610	1612	Hong Kong, via Hawaii.
1614	1615	He's not going to Hawaii.
1618	1620	Well, look what we've got here!
1621	1623	Assaulting a police officer.
1674	1676	Hey, soldier, shape it up!
1676	1678	Roper! Hey, how are you, man?
1679	1682	How am I? I'm glad to see you,that's how I am.
1682	1684	How long has it been? Five?
1684	1687	Six years, man. Not as long as it seems.
1688	1689	Yeah, I know what you mean.
1689	1691	What have you been doing since 'Nam?
1691	1693	Hanging in a little bit.
1693	1695	- All these yours, man?- Always first class.
1696	1697	Same old Roper.
1702	1704	Come here.
1707	1708	Parsons.
1709	1713	Yeah, from New Zealand. This man'sputting quite a collection together.
1714	1715	Know him?
1716	1718	No, never saw him before.
1719	1721	What do you know about this Han cat?
1723	1725	Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.
1729	1732	They don't live so big over there.
1732	1735	Ghettos are the same all over the world.They stink.
1738	1740	Same old Williams.
1828	1831	What have we got here? A little action.
1831	1834	Insects. I'll lay you $50 on the big one.
1836	1838	$50 on the big one. All right?
1839	1840	I'll give you five to one.
1841	1843	Would you bet $100?
1844	1845	You're on.
1854	1856	Come on, let's end this thing quickly.
1861	1864	Hey, that's it, come on,just get him on his back!
1870	1873	For crying out loud,would you believe that?
1877	1878	Oh, shit!
1932	1933	Do I bother you?
1934	1936	Don't waste yourself.
1938	1939	What's your style?
1939	1941	My style?
1942	1945	You can call it the art of fightingwithout fighting.
1945	1948	The art of fighting without fighting?
1949	1950	Show me some of it.
1950	1951	Later.
1958	1960	All right.
1962	1964	Don't you think we need more room?
1966	1967	Where else?
1968	1972	That island, on a beach.We can take this boat.
1981	1982	Okay.
1996	1999	Hey, what the hell are you doing?Are you crazy?
2002	2004	Pull me in. Pull me in!
2006	2008	Don't try to pull yourself up...
2009	2011	...or I'll let go of the line.
2071	2073	Would you look at that?
2077	2081	A woman like that could teach youa lot about yourself.
2105	2106	Welcome.
2164	2165	This way.
2169	2173	I'll show you to your rooms.The banquet begins promptly at 8:00.
2173	2176	I think you'll find our little islandquite charming.
2293	2297	I hope you haven't spent all that moneyyou won from me yesterday.
2298	2299	I plan to win it back.
2299	2300	How?
2302	2304	You'll find out after you've lost it.
2305	2308	You seem to be very much at home here,Mr. Roper.
2309	2312	This guy, Han,has a great sense of hospitality.
2312	2314	And a fantastic sense of style.
2317	2318	Yeah, it's great.
2319	2321	Then why are you so apprehensive?
2321	2322	Apprehensive?
2323	2327	No, I was just wonderingwhether it was okay to drink the water.
2328	2330	Mr. Roper, don't con me.
2331	2333	Want to bet?
2343	2346	No, I really don't think so. Thanks.
2348	2350	What's the matter? Are you on a diet?
2350	2354	I'd like to eat if I could find somethingI could keep down.
2354	2359	I can't wait to meet our host.I hear this is only one of his "B" parties.
2360	2363	Have you ever beento a martial arts tournament like this?
2364	2365	Never.
2366	2369	I have a funny feelingwe're being fattened up for the kill.
2371	2375	Better keep an eye out for the referee.Know what I mean?
2375	2376	Yeah.
2412	2414	Gentlemen, welcome!
2415	2417	You honor our island.
2419	2421	I look forward to a tournament...
2422	2424	...of truly epic proportions.
2426	2428	We are unique, gentlemen...
2428	2431	...in that we create ourselves.
2432	2435	Through long years of rigorous training,sacrifice...
2436	2437	...denial, pain...
2438	2441	...we forge our bodies in the fire of our will.
2443	2445	But tonight, let us celebrate.
2446	2448	Gentlemen...
2448	2450	...you have our gratitude.
2520	2521	Mr. Williams!
2531	2533	Mr. Williams!
2542	2543	For me?
2547	2548	You shouldn't have.
2549	2551	But...
2553	2555	...l'll take you, darling.
2558	2559	And you.
2563	2564	And you.
2566	2567	And you.
2572	2574	Please understand, if I missed anyone...
2576	2579	...it's been a big day. I'm a little tired.
2581	2583	Of course, Mr. Williams.
2584	2587	You must conserve your strength.
2590	2592	Come in.
2597	2599	A gift, Mr. Lee.
2607	2610	If you don't see anything you like...
2610	2612	There was a girl at the feast tonight.
2612	2613	Which girl, sir?
2615	2617	The owner of this dart.
2618	2620	Yes, I know the one.
2622	2624	I'll send her to you.
2631	2634	Another fine mess you got me into.
2638	2639	Come in.
2657	2659	Well, well, one more lovely than the next.
2659	2661	What did you have in mind?
2662	2663	Pick one.
2666	2667	I already have.
2670	2672	A wise decision.
2685	2687	I want to talk to you...
2687	2688	...Mei Ling.
2690	2692	Where do you come from?
2692	2693	Braithwaite.
2693	2695	Let's be quiet.
2695	2696	Have you seen anything?
2696	2699	Nothing much. I'm kept in the palace...
2699	2701	...watched always.
2701	2704	I know nothing of Han's activitiesaway from the palace.
2705	2706	But I can tell you this:
2706	2708	- People disappear.- Who?
2708	2710	The girls. Every one of them.
2711	2715	They're summoned to Han's at night,and the next day they're gone.
2717	2719	I know I don't have much time.
2734	2737	You must attend the morning ritualin uniform.
2737	2739	Outside.
2761	2763	Why are you not in uniform?
2822	2825	Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!
2831	2832	Bolo!
2924	2926	Good work, you made me some bread!
2927	2929	- Mr. Roper?- I'm ready.
2929	2930	Okay.
2933	2935	I've got myself a real pigeon here.
2936	2939	Keep the action going for me, will you?
2939	2941	What do you think, Roper?
2941	2944	No sweat. Give my friendeight to three all the way.
3057	3059	I'm finding out about myself.
3060	3062	This is the real me, definitely.
3063	3065	Do you like it here?
3065	3067	Yes. But a little lower.
3067	3070	I know. I mean here, on the island.
3071	3073	Yes, I like it here.
3073	3075	A little lower.
3075	3077	A man like you belongs here.
3084	3086	To you I'm just another pretty face.
3118	3120	Where are you going?
3121	3123	Out in the moonlight, baby.
3123	3125	It is not allowed. You must stay.
3128	3129	Good-bye.
3472	3473	A human fly!
3479	3481	It seems that one of you...
3482	3484	...was not content last night...
3486	3488	...with the hospitality...
3488	3490	...of the palace...
3491	3493	...and sought diversion...
3493	3495	...elsewhere on the island.
3497	3499	Who it was...
3499	3501	...is not important at this time.
3504	3506	What is important is that...
3508	3511	...my guards performedtheir duties incompetently.
3514	3516	And now they must prove...
3517	3520	...themselves worthy to remain among us.
3625	3628	Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?
3629	3632	Only at how sloppily your man works.
3636	3637	Mr. Lee?
3639	3641	Are you ready?
3680	3682	Boards don't hit back.
3689	3690	Go!
3737	3739	Oharra!
3813	3814	Oharra!
3876	3879	Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.
3899	3902	If you want to talk about this,I'll be in my room.
3902	3903	I got you.
3908	3912	Williams, come here! I want you to goto Han's study as soon as possible.
3918	3920	Hey, Roper, I'll see you in half an hour.
3930	3933	- Mr. Han?- You fought well yesterday.
3935	3937	Your style is unorthodox.
3937	3939	But effective.
3939	3942	It is not the art but the combat you enjoy.
3944	3945	The winning.
3947	3948	We are all ready to win.
3949	3952	Just as we are born knowing only life.
3955	3958	It is defeat that you must learnto prepare for.
3962	3964	I don't waste my time with it.
3964	3966	When it comes, I won't even notice.
3967	3968	How so?
3969	3972	I'll be too busy looking good.
3973	3976	What were you looking forwhen you attacked my guards?
3977	3978	It wasn't me.
3979	3981	You were the only man outside the palace.
3983	3986	I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.
3987	3989	You will tell me who else.
3990	3993	Mr. Han, suddenly I'd liketo leave your island.
3994	3996	It is not possible.
3996	3997	Bullshit, Mr. Han!
4004	4007	You come right out of a comic book!
4031	4033	Been practicing?
4139	4142	My friend, Williams,is expecting me in my room.
4142	4144	I wanted to talk to you.
4144	4147	We will meet your friend, Williams, later.
4147	4148	Okay.
4148	4150	This is my museum.
4152	4154	It is difficult to associate these horrors...
4154	4158	...with the proud civilizationsthat created them.
4158	4161	Sparta, Rome, the Knights of Europe,the Samurai.
4163	4165	They worshipped strength...
4165	4169	...because it is strengththat makes all other values possible.
4170	4172	Nothing survives without it.
4173	4177	Who knows what delicate wondershave died out of the world...
4178	4181	...for want of the strength to survive?
4181	4182	What's this?
4188	4189	A souvenir.
4200	4201	Up here.
4201	4205	A guillotine. No thanks.This is the only angle I care to see it from.
4205	4207	If you please, Mr. Roper.
4211	4214	You mean you want meto put my head on that thing?
4214	4215	An act of faith.
4218	4220	I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.
4236	4238	Very few people can be totally ruthless.
4239	4240	It isn't easy.
4240	4243	It takes more strengththan you might believe.
4264	4266	Now you've got eight more.
4274	4277	Then there is a pointyou will not go beyond.
4282	4283	Faked out again.
4293	4294	This way.
4305	4307	Our power plant.
4320	4321	Oh, yes.
4323	4324	A lifetime of women.
4326	4328	A man's strength can be measuredby his appetites.
4328	4332	Indeed, a man's strength flowsfrom his appetites.
4333	4335	No, they are my daughters.
4338	4339	Your daughters?
4342	4343	I'm sorry. I thought...
4343	4345	I misunderstood. Miss Han...
4351	4354	Also, they are my most personal guard.
4355	4357	I admire your judgment.
4357	4360	Nobody is as loyal as Daddy's little girl.
4362	4363	Mr. Roper?
4363	4366	No, thanks, I'll get up myself.
4368	4369	Nice meeting you.
4378	4379	Opium!
4382	4385	We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.
4387	4390	The business of corruptionis like any other.
4392	4395	Provide your customerswith products they need, and...
4397	4401	...encourage that need a little bitto stimulate your market and...
4401	4405	...soon your customers will depend on you.I mean really need you.
4405	4407	It's the law of economics.
4407	4408	Right.
4409	4412	Here we are stimulatingquite another need.
4430	4433	You wonder why I am exposingso much of myself?
4434	4436	I forget what I see very easily.
4437	4439	But then, why are you?
4439	4443	I'm hoping you'll join us,represent us in the United States.
4446	4450	I'm beginning to understandthis tournament thing, the whole set-up.
4450	4453	It's a great way to recruit new talent.
4459	4460	And who are they?
4461	4464	Refuse found in waterfront bars.
4466	4467	Shanghaied?
4469	4472	Just lost, drunken menwho no longer care...
4472	4474	...where they find themselveseach morning.
4482	4485	You left some rather sizeable debtsin America.
4486	4489	Diner's Club hasn't called in my card yet.
4502	4506	There were some questionswhich I was forced to ask.
4506	4508	I got no answers.
4528	4531	And you want me to join this?
4531	4533	There are certain realities.
4533	4536	I want us to have a clear understanding.
4550	4551	No.
4553	4555	There's no misunderstanding between us.
4687	4688	Help me!
4688	4690	I'm only 17!
4693	4694	Help me! Please, help me!
4695	4698	Come back, please!You have to come back, please!
4703	4704	Quiet!
5059	5062	The battle with the guardswas magnificent.
5063	5065	Your skill is extraordinary.
5067	5070	And I was going to ask you to join us.
5086	5090	My God, this came in half an hour ago!Why didn't I...
5092	5094	Put your colonel on.
5095	5096	Well, wake him up.
5098	5100	I don't care if he's not alone!
5103	5108	Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!You bloody well put him on the line!
5134	5135	Good morning, Mr. Roper.
5136	5138	We have been waiting for you.
5139	5141	What's going on?
5141	5145	Would you be good enough to participatein this morning's edification?
5145	5147	Edification?
5153	5155	What are you going to do to him?
5155	5157	Not me, Mr. Roper. You.
5201	5202	Like you said...
5203	5205	...there's a point I won't go beyond.
5206	5208	I was right about you.
5208	5212	We shall strive to be worthyof your sense of grandeur.
5213	5216	I will find someonewith whom you can fight.
5358	5360	Quick, go destroy them! Kill!
5390	5392	Kill them!
5397	5399	Kill!
5568	5570	You have offended my family...
5571	5574	...and you have offendedthe Shaolin Temple.
5902	5904	Remember...
5904	5907	...the enemy hasonly images and illusions...
5907	5910	...behind which he hides his true motives.
5912	5915	Destroy the image,and you will break the enemy.
