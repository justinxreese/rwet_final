717	719	[Soldiers cheering]
758	760	COMMODUS: Do you think he's really dying?
761	763	He's been dying for 10 years.
764	767	If he weren't really dying,he wouldn't have sent for us.
767	769	Maybe he just misses us.
769	772	And the senators?He wouldn't have summoned them if...
772	773	Peace, Commodus.
773	777	After two weeks on the road,your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
784	787	He's made his decision.He's going to announce it.
791	793	He will name me.
795	799	The first thing I shall do when...
801	805	Is honor him with gamesworthy of His Majesty.

832	834	My horse.
834	835	SOLDIER 2: My lord.
839	840	Kiss?
851	854	[Somber instrumental music]
874	878	You have proved your valor yet again,Maximus.
880	882	Let us hope, for the last time.
883	885	There's no one left to fight, sire.
885	887	There is always someone left to fight.
888	890	How can I reward Rome's greatest general?
896	897	Let me go home.
900	901	Home.
902	904	[Somber instrumental music]
909	911	[Soldiers cheering]
919	920	They honor you, Caesar.
920	923	It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.
932	933	[Soldiers cheering]
945	948	Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?
949	951	You have missed the war.
951	953	Father, congratulations.
954	956	I shall sacrifice 100 bullsto honor your triumph.
956	958	Save the bulls.
958	960	Honor Maximus. He won the battle.
961	963	COMMODUS: General.MAXIMUS: Highness.
964	967	Rome salutes you,and I embrace you as a brother.
967	969	It has been too long, my old friend.
969	970	Highness.
971	973	Here, Father. Take my arm.
975	978	I think it is time for me to leave.
992	995	So much for the glory of Rome.
996	998	[Melancholic instrumental music]
1047	1050	[Melancholic instrumental music continues]
1074	1075	[Drums beating]
1081	1082	Magnificent battle.
1087	1090	[Triumphant instrumental music]
1105	1107	General. Still alive?
1107	1108	QUINTUS: Still alive.
1108	1110	The gods must have a sense of humor.
1110	1113	QUINTUS: The gods must love you.MAXIMUS: Valerius.
1113	1115	Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?
1116	1119	Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.
1119	1122	Maximus the farmer.I still have difficulty imagining that.
1122	1126	You know, dirt cleans offa lot easier than blood, Quintus.
1126	1128	- Here he is.- Highness.
1128	1130	COMMODUS: Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.
1130	1133	Beware of Gaius.He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear...
1133	1137	and you'll wake up one day and allyou'll say is,Â” Republic."
1137	1139	Well, why not?Rome was founded as a republic.
1139	1142	Yes, and in a republicthe senate has the power.
1142	1144	But Senator Gaiusisn't influenced by that, of course.
1144	1147	Where do you stand, General?Emperor or Senate?
1147	1152	A soldier has the advantage of being ableto look his enemy in the eye, Senator.
1152	1156	Well, with an army behind you,you could be extremely political.
1156	1159	I warned you. Now I shall save you.Senators.
1159	1161	[Triumphant instrumental music continues]
1168	1170	Maximus.
1171	1173	I'm going to need good men like you.
1175	1178	How may I be of service, Highness?
1178	1180	You're a man who knows what it isto command.
1181	1184	You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,and the battle is won.
1184	1188	But these senators scheme, squabbleand flatter and deceive.
1189	1192	COMMODUS: We must save Romefrom the politicians, my friend.
1192	1195	Can I count on you when the time comes?
1200	1203	Highness, when your father releases me,I intend to return home.
1203	1207	Home? Well, no one's earned it more.
1208	1212	Don't get too comfortable.I may call on you before long.
1214	1216	COMMODUS: Lucilla's here. Did you know?
1217	1218	She's not forgotten you.
1220	1222	And now, you're the great man.
1234	1236	If only you had been born a man...
1237	1239	what a Caesar you would have made.
1241	1242	Father.
1246	1248	[Soft instrumental music]
1248	1250	You would have been strong.
1250	1253	I wonder, would you have been just?
1254	1256	I would have beenwhat you taught me to be.
1258	1260	How was your journey?
1260	1264	Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?
1264	1267	I need your help. With your brother.
1267	1269	Of course.
1269	1271	He loves you. He always has.
1272	1273	And...
1275	1278	he will need you now, more than ever.
1283	1284	Enough of politics.
1285	1288	Let us pretendthat you are a loving daughter...
1288	1290	and I am a good father.
1293	1295	[Soft instrumental music continues]
1296	1298	This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
1306	1308	[Solemn instrumental music]
1311	1312	SOLDIER: Good morning.
1320	1323	[Solemn instrumental music continues]
1325	1327	SOLDIER 2: I need three more horses.
1337	1339	Two! Three!
1339	1341	SOLDIER 7: Four!
1341	1343	SOLDIER 3: One! Two!
1358	1361	MAXIMUS: You sent for me, Caesar?
1365	1368	- Caesar?- Tell me again, Maximus.
1369	1370	Why are we here?
1372	1374	For the glory of the empire, sire.
1374	1375	Yes.
1377	1379	Yes, I remember.
1382	1384	Do you see that map, Maximus?
1385	1388	That is the world which I created.
1388	1390	For 25 years...
1391	1394	I have conquered, spilt blood,expanded the empire.
1396	1399	Since I became Caesar,I've known four years without war.
1399	1402	Four years of peace in 20.
1402	1403	And for what?
1406	1407	[Sighs]
1411	1414	I brought the sword. Nothing more.
1415	1417	Caesar, your life...
1417	1419	Please. Please don't call me that.
1419	1422	Come. Please.
1422	1424	Come sit.
1425	1427	Let us talk together now...
1428	1430	very simply, as men.
1431	1432	Well, Maximus...
1435	1436	talk.
1439	1441	5,000 of my men are out therein the freezing mud.
1442	1445	3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.2,000 will never leave this place.
1445	1448	I will not believe that they foughtand died for nothing.
1448	1450	CAESAR: And what would you believe?
1450	1453	They fought for you and for Rome.
1453	1455	And what is Rome, Maximus?
1457	1460	I've seen much of the rest of the world.
1460	1463	It is brutal and cruel and dark.Rome is the light.
1464	1465	Yet you have never been there.
1465	1468	You have not seen what it has become.
1468	1471	I am dying, Maximus.
1471	1473	When a man sees his end...
1473	1476	he wants to know there was some purposeto his life.
1477	1480	How will the world speak my namein years to come?
1480	1482	Will I be known as the philosopher?
1482	1484	The warrior?
1484	1485	The tyrant?
1487	1491	Or will I be the Emperorwho gave Rome back her true self?
1492	1494	CAESAR: There was once a dreamthat was Rome.
1494	1497	You could only whisper it.
1497	1500	Anything more than a whisperand it would vanish...
1500	1502	it was so fragile.
1502	1506	And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
1507	1509	CAESAR: Maximus...
1510	1512	let us whisper now...
1513	1514	together, you and I.
1515	1516	You have a son.
1518	1520	Tell me about your home.
1522	1524	[Surreal instrumental music]
1526	1528	My house is in the hills above Trujillo.
1530	1531	A very simple place.
1532	1535	Pink stones that warm in the sun.
1535	1538	A kitchen gardenthat smells of herbs in the day...
1539	1541	jasmine in the evening.
1542	1545	Through the gate is a giant poplar.
1545	1548	Figs, apples, pears.
1548	1551	The soil, Marcus, black.Black like my wife's hair.
1552	1555	Grapes on the south slopes,olives on the north.
1555	1557	Wild ponies play near my house.They tease my son.
1557	1558	He wants to be one of them.
1558	1560	When was the last time you were home?
1560	1563	Two years, 264 days and this morning.
1565	1568	I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.
1570	1571	Worth fighting for.
1574	1576	CAESAR: There is one more duty...
1577	1579	that I ask of you before you go home.
1581	1583	What would you have me do, Caesar?
1583	1587	CAESAR: I want you to becomethe protector of Rome after I die.
1588	1591	I will empower you to one end alone...
1591	1595	to give power back to the people of Rome...
1595	1598	and end the corruption that has crippled it.
1598	1600	[Surreal instrumental music continues]
1604	1607	Will you accept this great honorthat I have offered you?
1609	1611	With all my heart, no.
1613	1615	Maximus...
1615	1618	that is why it must be you.
1618	1620	But surely a prefect, a senator...
1620	1623	somebody who knows the city,who understands her politics.
1623	1626	CAESAR: But you have not been corruptedby her politics.
1630	1634	- And Commodus?- Commodus is not a moral man.
1635	1637	You have known that since you were young.
1637	1639	CAESAR: Commodus cannot rule.
1639	1642	CAESAR: He must not rule.
1643	1646	You are the son that I should have had.
1648	1651	Commodus will accept my decision.
1653	1658	He knows that you commandthe loyalty of the army.
1659	1661	[Somber instrumental music]
1663	1664	I need some time, sire.
1664	1666	Yes.
1666	1669	By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.
1670	1672	Now embrace me as my son.
1675	1678	And bring an old man another blanket.
1694	1696	LUCILLA: My father favors you now.MAXIMUS: My lady.
1697	1699	- It was not always so.- Many things change.
1700	1703	Many things. Not everything.
1706	1707	LUCILLA: Maximus, stop.
1711	1712	Let me see your face.
1715	1718	LUCILLA: You seem upset.MAXIMUS: I lost many men.
1718	1721	What did my father want with you?
1722	1724	To wish me well before I leave for home.
1725	1727	You're lying.
1727	1730	I could always tell when you were lyingbecause you were never any good at it.
1730	1733	- I never acquired your comfort with it.- True.
1733	1735	But then you never had to.
1735	1738	Life is more simple for a soldier.
1739	1742	Or do you think me heartless?
1743	1745	I think you have a talent for survival.
1749	1750	[Chuckles]
1751	1752	Maximus, stop.
1755	1757	Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
1757	1760	No. I'm tired from battle.
1760	1763	LUCILLA: It hurts you to seemy father so fragile.
1766	1770	Commodus expects that my father willannounce his succession within days.
1771	1775	Will you serve my brotheras you served his father?
1775	1777	[Soft instrumental music]
1777	1779	I will always serve Rome.
1781	1782	Do you know...
1783	1785	I still remember you in my prayers.
1786	1789	Oh, yes. I pray.
1793	1796	I was sad to hear of your husband's death.I mourned him.
1798	1801	- Thank you.- And I hear you have a son.
1802	1805	Yes. Lucius.
1806	1808	He'll be nearly eight years old.
1808	1810	My son is also nearly eight.
1813	1815	MAXIMUS: I thank you for your prayers.
1823	1825	MAXIMUS: Ancestors,I ask for your guidance.
1826	1830	Blessed Mother, come to mewith the gods' desire for my future.
1831	1835	Blessed Father, watch over my wife and sonwith a ready sword.
1836	1839	MAXIMUS: Whisper to them,I live only to hold them again.
1840	1842	Ancestors, I honor you...
1843	1846	and will try to livewith the dignity you have taught me.
1847	1849	[Sentimental instrumental music]
1868	1870	MAXIMUS: Cicero.
1874	1875	Sir.
1879	1882	Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?
1884	1887	Sometimes I do what I want to do.
1887	1890	The rest of the time, I do what I have to.
1893	1896	We may not be able to go home, after all.
1901	1902	[Sighs]
1940	1942	[Solemn instrumental music]
1945	1947	CAESAR: Are you ready to do your dutyfor Rome?
1950	1952	Yes, Father.
1953	1955	You will not be emperor.
1958	1960	Which wiser, older man is to take my place?
1960	1963	My powers will pass to Maximus...
1964	1965	to hold in trust...
1966	1969	until the Senate is ready to rule once more.
1971	1974	Rome is to be a republic again.
1976	1978	COMMODUS: Maximus.CAESAR: Yes.
1984	1986	My decision disappoints you?
1990	1992	You wrote to me once...
1993	1996	listing the four chief virtues:
1997	1999	Wisdom...
1999	2000	justice...
2000	2002	fortitude...
2002	2004	and temperance.
2006	2009	As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.
2010	2012	But I have other virtues, Father.
2013	2015	Ambition.
2016	2019	That can be a virtuewhen it drives us to excel.
2020	2023	COMMODUS: Resourcefulness, courage.
2024	2028	Perhaps not on the battlefield,but there are many forms of courage.
2030	2033	Devotion to my family...
2034	2035	to you.
2037	2039	But none of my virtues were on your list.
2039	2041	[Solemn instrumental music continues]
2041	2044	Even then it was as ifyou didn't want me for your son.
2045	2046	Commodus...
2047	2048	you go too far.
2049	2052	I searched the faces of the gods...
2053	2057	for ways to please you, to make you proud.
2058	2060	One kind word...
2060	2062	one full hug...
2062	2066	where you pressed me to your chestand held me tight...
2067	2070	would have been like the sun on my heartfor 1,000 years.
2073	2075	COMMODUS: What is it in me you hateso much?
2075	2076	Commodus.
2077	2080	All I've ever wanted...
2080	2084	was to live up to you, Caesar.
2085	2088	COMMODUS: Father.CAESAR: Commodus...
2092	2094	your faults as a son...
2095	2098	is my failure as a father.
2108	2110	Come.
2110	2112	[Dramatic instrumental music]
2113	2115	Father.
2118	2119	[Sobs]
2129	2131	I would butcher the whole world...
2132	2135	if you would only have loved me!
2138	2139	[Caesar choking]
2139	2141	[Commodus grunting]
2142	2143	[Sobs]
2146	2148	[Caesar groaning]
2152	2154	[Tense instrumental music]
2154	2156	[Caesar groans]
2171	2174	Maximus, the Emperor needs you.It's urgent.
2179	2181	Lament with me, brother.
2182	2184	Our great father is dead.
2187	2189	[Grave instrumental music]
2209	2211	MAXIMUS: How did he die?
2212	2215	COMMODUS: The surgeons saythere was no pain.
2215	2217	His breath gave out as he slept.
2226	2227	MAXIMUS: Father.

2318	2320	Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.
2321	2323	QUINTUS: The Emperor diedof natural causes.
2325	2327	- Why are you armed, Quintus?- Guards!
2330	2332	Please don't fight, Maximus.
2334	2336	I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.
2336	2338	Ride until dawn...
2339	2341	and then execute him.
2341	2343	Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

3550	3552	Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.
3552	3554	I think he could do very well.
3555	3557	GRACCHUS: For Rome, or for you?
3558	3560	[Stately instrumental music continues]
3563	3566	GRACCHUS: Go to your mother, Lucius.It's what she'd like.
3572	3574	LUCILLA: Lucius!LUCIUS: Mother!
3576	3577	BOY 1: Hail, Caesar.
3577	3579	Senators.
3582	3585	Rome greets her new emperor.
3585	3589	Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,Highness.
3589	3591	Thank you, Falco.
3591	3595	And for the loyal subjects,I trust they weren't too expensive.
3595	3597	GRACCHUS: Caesar.COMMODUS: Gracchus.
3597	3599	All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.
3599	3602	There are many mattersthat require your attention.
3605	3608	GRACCHUS: To order, please. To order.
3608	3612	For your guidance, Caesar, the Senatehas prepared a series of protocols...
3613	3615	to begin addressing the many problemsin the city...
3616	3619	beginning with basic sanitationfor the Greek Quarter...
3620	3623	to combat the plaguewhich is already springing up there.
3624	3625	GRACCHUS: So, if Caesar...
3627	3629	Don't you see, Gracchus?
3631	3633	That's the very problem, isn't it?
3633	3636	COMMODUS: My father spent all his timeat study...
3637	3641	at books of learning and philosophy.
3642	3645	COMMODUS: He spent his twilight hoursreading scrolls from the Senate.
3646	3649	And all the while, the people were forgotten.
3650	3652	But the Senate is the people, sire...
3652	3655	chosen from among the peopleto speak for the people.
3656	3659	I doubt many of the peopleeat so well as you do, Gracchus.
3660	3662	Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
3662	3664	I think I understand my own people.
3665	3668	Then perhaps Caesar will be so goodas to teach us...
3668	3671	out of his own extensive experience.
3671	3673	[Senators chuckling heartily]
3675	3676	I call it love.
3676	3679	I am their father.The people are my children.
3680	3682	I shall hold them to my bosomand embrace them tightly.
3682	3685	Have you ever embracedsomeone dying of plague, sire?
3692	3694	No, but if you interrupt me again...
3696	3697	I assure you that you shall.
3697	3699	Senator, my brother is very tired.
3700	3704	Leave your list with me.Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.
3705	3709	My lady, as always,your lightest touch commands obedience.
3716	3718	COMMODUS: Who are they to lecture me?
3719	3721	Commodus, the Senate has its uses.
3721	3724	What uses? All they do is talk.
3725	3730	It should be just you and me and Rome.
3730	3733	Don't even think it.There's always been a Senate.
3733	3735	COMMODUS: Rome has changed.
3735	3738	It takes an emperor to rule an empire.
3738	3740	Of course, but leave the people their...
3740	3742	COMMODUS: Illusions?
3743	3744	Traditions.
3745	3748	My father's war against the barbarians...
3749	3752	He said it himself: it achieved nothing.But the people loved him.
3752	3754	The people always love victories.
3754	3758	Why? They didn't see the battles.
3759	3761	What do they care about Germania?
3761	3763	They care about the greatness of Rome.
3763	3765	"The greatness of Rome."
3767	3768	Well, what is that?
3771	3774	It's an idea. Greatness.
3778	3781	LUCILLA: Greatness is a vision.COMMODUS: Exactly. A vision.
3783	3785	Do you not see, Lucilla?
3786	3790	I will give the people a vision of Rome,and they'll love me for it.
3791	3795	And they'll soon forget the tedioussermonizing of a few dry old men.
3806	3809	I will give the peoplethe greatest vision of their lives.

3877	3881	Clever. The whole of Romewould be laughing at him...
3881	3884	if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.
3884	3886	Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.
3888	3891	You really think the peopleare going to be seduced by that?
3891	3894	I think he knows what Rome is.Rome is the mob.
3894	3897	Conjure magic for them,and they'll be distracted.
3898	3901	Take away their freedom,and still they'll roar.
3902	3906	The beating heart of Romeis not the marble of the Senate.
3906	3908	It's the sand of the Colosseum.
3910	3912	He'll bring them death...
3913	3916	and they will love him for it.

4054	4057	You're good, Spaniard,but you're not that good.
4057	4058	PROXIMO: You could be magnificent.
4059	4062	I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.
4062	4065	That's enough for the provinces,but not for Rome.
4069	4072	The young emperorhas arranged a series of spectacles...
4073	4077	to commemorate his father,Marcus Aurelius.
4077	4079	I find that amusing...
4079	4082	since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise...
4082	4086	the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,that closed us down.
4088	4092	So finally,after five years of scratching a living...
4093	4095	in flea-infested villages...
4095	4098	we're finally going back to where we belong:
4098	4100	the Colosseum.
4102	4105	You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.
4106	4108	Fifty-thousand Romans...
4109	4112	watching every movement of your sword...
4114	4116	willing you to make that killer blow.
4117	4121	The silence before you strikeand the noise afterwards.
4122	4125	It rises. It rises up...
4127	4128	like a storm.
4129	4131	As if you were the thunder god himself.
4131	4134	- You were a gladiator?- Yes, I was.
4138	4140	[Somber instrumental music]
4140	4142	You won your freedom?
4143	4145	A long time ago, the Emperor...
4146	4149	presented me with a rudius.
4150	4152	It's just a wooden sword.
4153	4155	The symbol of your freedom.
4157	4160	He touched me on the shoulder,and I was free.
4160	4161	[Chuckles heartily]
4161	4164	You knew Marcus Aurelius?
4164	4167	I did not say I knew him.I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
4168	4170	MAXIMUS: You asked me what I want.
4172	4174	I, too, want to standin front of the Emperor...
4176	4177	as you did.
4177	4180	PROXIMO: Then listen to me. Learn from me.
4181	4184	I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.
4185	4188	I was the best because the crowd loved me.
4189	4192	Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.
4193	4195	[Solemn instrumental music]
4196	4198	I will win the crowd.
4200	4203	I will give them somethingthey've never seen before.
4203	4204	[Proximo laughs]
4205	4208	PROXIMO: So, Spaniard,we shall go to Rome together...
4208	4210	and have bloody adventures.
4210	4212	PROXIMO: And the great whorewill suckle us...
4212	4214	until we are fat and happyand can suckle no more.
4214	4216	And then...
4217	4219	when enough men have died...
4221	4223	perhaps you will have your freedom.
4227	4230	Here. Use this.

4271	4273	Do you believe you'll see them againwhen you die?
4273	4275	I think so.
4275	4278	But then, I will die soon.
4280	4282	They will not die for many years.
4283	4284	JUBA: I'll have to wait.
4284	4287	But you would? Wait?
4287	4288	Of course.
4290	4292	You see...
4293	4294	my wife...
4295	4299	and my son are already waiting for me.
4300	4303	You'll meet them again. But not yet.

4506	4508	Commodus, drink this tonic.
4518	4520	COMMODUS: I think the time is almost right.
4520	4523	I could announcethe dissolution of the Senate...

5329	5331	As for this young man,he insists you are Hector reborn.
5331	5333	Or was it Hercules?
5334	5338	Why doesn't the hero reveal himselfand tell us all your real name?

5529	5530	[Panting]
5547	5549	Why is he still alive?
5550	5551	I don't know.
5552	5553	He shouldn't be alive.
5554	5555	It vexes me.
5557	5559	I'm terribly vexed.
5569	5571	I did what I had to do.
5572	5576	If Father had had his way,the empire would have been torn apart.
5576	5578	You do see that.
5578	5579	Yes.
5584	5587	What did you feel when you saw him?
5589	5590	I felt nothing.
5592	5595	He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
5596	5598	No more than I wounded him.
5602	5604	They lied to me in Germania.
5606	5608	They told me he was dead.
5610	5612	If they lie to me, they don't respect me.
5612	5616	If they don't respect me,how can they ever love me?
5617	5619	Then you must let the legions know...
5619	5622	their treachery will not go unpunished.
5623	5625	COMMODUS: Poor sister.
5625	5627	I wouldn't want to be your enemy.
5628	5630	What will you do?
5636	5638	[Tense instrumental music]
5642	5644	GUARD: This way.
5678	5681	Rich matrons pay wellto be pleasured by the bravest champions.
5681	5683	I knew your brother would send assassins.
5684	5686	I didn't realize he would send his best.
5688	5690	Maximus, he doesn't know.
5691	5694	My family was burnt and crucifiedwhile they were still alive.
5694	5696	- I knew nothing...- Don't lie to me!
5703	5704	I wept for them.
5704	5708	As you wept for your father?
5708	5712	I have been living in a prison of fearsince that day.
5712	5716	To be unable to mourn your fatherfor fear of your brother.
5717	5720	To live in terrorevery moment of every day...
5720	5722	because your son is heir to the throne.
5724	5726	I have wept.
5727	5730	My son was innocent.
5730	5732	So is mine.
5734	5737	Must my son die, too,before you'll trust me?
5739	5741	What does it matter if I trust you or not?
5742	5745	LUCILLA: The gods have spared you.Don't you understand?
5745	5749	Today I saw a slave become more powerfulthan the emperor of Rome.
5749	5750	The gods have spared me?
5751	5754	I am at their mercy,with the power only to amuse a mob.
5754	5756	LUCILLA: That is power.
5756	5757	LUCILLA: The mob is Rome.
5757	5761	And while Commodus controls them,he controls everything.
5761	5762	Listen to me.
5763	5766	My brother has enemies,most of all in the Senate.
5766	5768	But while the people follow him...
5768	5771	no one would dare stand up to himuntil you.
5772	5774	They oppose him, yet they do nothing.
5774	5778	There are some politicianswho have dedicated their lives to Rome.
5778	5780	One man above all.
5781	5784	If I can arrange it, will you meet him?
5784	5786	Do you not understand?
5786	5790	I may die in this cell tonight,or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!
5790	5793	What possible difference can I make?
5793	5795	This man wants what you want.
5795	5797	Then have him kill Commodus!
5800	5802	I knew a man once...
5803	5804	a noble man.
5805	5807	A man of principle who loved my father...
5808	5810	and my father loved him.
5812	5814	This man served Rome well.
5815	5817	[Sentimental instrumental music]
5819	5820	That man is gone.
5821	5823	Your brother did his work well.
5823	5825	Let me help you.
5831	5834	Yes, you can help me.
5837	5840	Forget you ever knew me,never come here again.
5844	5847	Guard! The lady is finished with me.

6585	6588	And now they love Maximus for his mercy.
6589	6593	So I can't just kill him,or it makes me even more unmerciful.
6594	6598	The whole thingis like some great nightmare.
6599	6601	FALCO: He is defying you.
6601	6604	His every victory is an act of defiance.

6609	6611	Every day he lives, they grow bolder.
6613	6614	- Kill him.- No.
6616	6619	I will not make a martyr of him.
6620	6622	Why?
6623	6627	I have been told of a certain sea snake...
6627	6631	which has a very unusual methodof attracting its prey.
6631	6635	It will lie at the bottom of the oceanas if wounded.
6635	6638	Then its enemies will approach...
6638	6641	and yet it will lie quite still.
6641	6645	And then its enemieswill take little bites of it...
6645	6648	and yet it remains still.
6651	6652	So...
6654	6655	we will lie still...
6656	6659	and let our enemies come to us and nibble.
6660	6662	Have every senator followed.

6804	6807	- The Senate is with you?- The Senate?
6808	6811	Yes. I can speak for them.
6811	6814	You can buy my freedomand smuggle me out of Rome?

6830	6831	loyal to Commodus.
6831	6834	Let my men see me alive,and you shall see where their loyalties lie.
6834	6836	This is madness.
6836	6840	No Roman army has entered the capitalin 100 years.
6840	6842	I will not trade one dictatorship for another!
6842	6845	The time for half measures and talk is over,Senator.
6846	6849	And after your glorious coup, what then?
6850	6854	You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?
6854	6855	I will leave.
6856	6859	The soldiers will stay for your protectionunder the command of the Senate.
6859	6860	So...
6861	6865	once all of Rome is yours,you'll just give it back to the people?
6866	6868	Tell me why.
6873	6876	Because that was the last wishof a dying man.
6879	6881	I will kill Commodus.
6883	6885	The fate of Rome I leave to you.
6887	6889	Marcus Aurelius trusted you.
6891	6893	His daughter trusts you.
6897	6899	I will trust you.
6899	6901	But we have little time.
6901	6903	Give me two days...
6904	6906	and I will buy your freedom.
6907	6908	GRACCHUS: And you...
6909	6911	You stay alive...
6912	6914	or I'll be dead.
6916	6917	Now we must go.
6922	6923	It won't work.
6924	6926	The Emperor knows too much.
6927	6928	And as for me...
6930	6932	it's becoming dangerous.
6933	6936	You'll be paid on my return.
6938	6939	I give you my word.
6939	6942	Your word? What if you don't return?
6944	6947	Do you remember what it wasto have trust, Proximo?
6947	6948	Trust?
6952	6954	Who am I to trust?
6954	6957	MAXIMUS: I will kill Commodus.PROXIMO: Why would I want that?
6958	6960	He makes me rich.
6962	6963	[Tense instrumental music]
6964	6967	I know that you are a man of your word,General.
6969	6971	PROXIMO: I know that you would diefor honor.
6973	6974	You would die for Rome.
6976	6979	You would die for the memoryof your ancestors.
6979	6981	PROXIMO: But I, on the other hand...
6983	6985	I'm an entertainer.
6989	6990	Guard!
6994	6997	He killed the man who set you free.

7089	7091	What's troubling you?
7093	7096	Does Gracchus have a new lover?
7097	7099	LUCILLA: I don't know.
7101	7103	I thought you'd seen him.
7104	7106	COMMODUS: He infects everyonelike a putrid fever.
7108	7111	For the health of Rome,the Senate must be bled.
7111	7113	And he will bleed, too.
7114	7115	Very soon.
7117	7118	But not tonight.
7133	7136	COMMODUS: Do you rememberwhat our father said once?
7137	7138	"It's a dream...
7140	7142	"a frightful dream...
7144	7146	"life is."
7148	7150	Do you think that's true?
7151	7152	I don't know.
7154	7156	[Tense instrumental music continues]
7156	7157	I think it is.
7160	7163	And I have only you to share it with.

7295	7298	My brother has had Gracchus arrested.
7298	7301	LUCILLA: We daren't wait any longer.We must leave tonight.
7301	7305	Proximo will come at midnightand take you to the gate.
7305	7309	Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting therewith horses.
7311	7313	MAXIMUS: You have done all this?LUCILLA: Yes.
7314	7316	You risk too much.
7317	7319	I have much to pay for.
7321	7323	MAXIMUS: You have nothing to pay for.
7323	7326	You love your son. You're strong for him.
7329	7331	I am tired of being strong.
7333	7337	My brother hates all the world,and you most of all.
7338	7341	MAXIMUS: Because your father chose me.LUCILLA: No.
7342	7344	Because my father loved you.
7348	7350	And because I loved you.
7353	7354	A long time ago.
7359	7361	Was I very different then?
7367	7369	MAXIMUS: You laughed more.
7373	7375	I have felt alone all my life...
7376	7378	except with you.
7381	7382	LUCILLA: I must go.

7390	7392	[Romantic instrumental music]
7411	7412	LUCIUS: There.
7424	7425	And I got you.
7428	7430	COMMODUS: Isn't it lateto be playing legionnaire?
7430	7432	I'm not a legionnaire.
7432	7435	- Not a legionnaire?- I'm a gladiator.
7436	7437	A gladiator?
7438	7440	Gladiators only fight in the games.
7441	7444	Wouldn't you rather bea great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
7444	7446	I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!
7449	7451	The savior of Rome?
7451	7453	[Tense instrumental music]
7459	7460	And who said that?
7469	7470	Where's Lucius?
7471	7474	He's with the Emperor, my lady.
7476	7478	LUCIUS: She couldn't.COMMODUS: She did.
7478	7480	She took it from a basket...
7482	7485	and pressed it to her breast,right here above her heart.
7487	7490	LUCIUS: It bit her in the breast?COMMODUS: Yes.
7491	7494	You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies...
7495	7499	behave very strangelyand do very odd things in the name of love.
7499	7501	LUCIUS: I think it's silly.COMMODUS: So do I.
7505	7507	Sister, join us.
7508	7509	COMMODUS: I've been readingto dear Lucius.
7509	7511	LUCIUS: I've been reading, too.COMMODUS: Yes.
7511	7515	He's a very clever little boy.He'll make a grand emperor one day.
7517	7521	We've been reading about the greatMark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.
7521	7523	And the queen killed herself with a snake.
7523	7527	COMMODUS: And just wait until you hearwhat happened to our ancestors.
7527	7531	If you're very good, tomorrow nightI'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.
7532	7534	He was betrayed...
7535	7537	by those closest to him.
7537	7539	[Tense instrumental music]
7539	7540	By his own blood.
7542	7544	They whispered in dark corners...
7544	7546	and went out late at night...
7547	7550	and conspired, and conspired.
7552	7556	But the Emperor Claudius knewthat they were up to something.
7556	7559	He knew they were busy little bees.
7560	7563	And one night he sat downwith one of them...
7564	7566	and he looked at her...
7567	7568	and he said:
7569	7572	"Tell me what you've been doing...
7573	7574	"busy little bee.
7576	7579	"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.
7580	7583	"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."
7587	7589	And the Emperor was heartbroken.
7591	7596	The little bee had wounded him more deeplythan anyone else could ever have done.
7598	7601	What do you think happened then, Lucius?
7601	7603	I don't know, Uncle.
7609	7612	The little bee told him everything.

7895	7897	COMMODUS: And what of my nephew?
7898	7900	And what of his mother?
7902	7904	Should they share her lover's fate?
7906	7908	Or should I be merciful?
7911	7912	Commodus the Merciful.
7919	7921	Lucius will stay with me now.
7922	7924	And if his mother...
7925	7927	so much as looks at me...
7928	7930	in a manner that displeases me...
7932	7934	he will die.
7934	7936	[Tense instrumental music]
7937	7940	If she decides to be noble...
7942	7944	and takes her own life...
7945	7947	he will die.
7947	7949	[Tense instrumental music continues]
7950	7952	COMMODUS: And as for you...
7955	7956	you will love me...
7957	7959	as I have loved you.
7960	7964	COMMODUS: You will provide mewith an heir of pure blood...
7965	7967	so that Commodus...
7967	7970	and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.
7974	7976	Am I not merciful?

8077	8080	The slave who became a gladiator.
8081	8084	The gladiator who defied an emperor.
8085	8087	A striking story.
8088	8091	COMMODUS: Now the people want to knowhow the story ends.
8094	8096	Only a famous death will do.
8098	8100	And what could be more glorious...
8100	8104	than to challenge the Emperor himselfin the great arena?

8110	8112	Do you think I'm afraid?
8113	8116	I think you have been afraid all your life.

8140	8142	[Solemn instrumental music]
8143	8144	He was your father.
8148	8150	You loved my father, I know...
8152	8153	but so did I.
