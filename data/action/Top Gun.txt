682	685	Any of you boys seenan aircraft carrier around here?
686	690	Man, we got a little problem uphere, that MiG really screwed him up.

780	781	My wife and kid, sir.
781	785	I almost orphaned him today,and I've never even seen him.
786	789	I don't know what happenedup there, but I was so scared.
789	791	Come on, we've seen this before.
791	792	No, sir.
794	800	I'm holding on too tight.I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.
802	803	I'm sorry.
810	811	Cougar?
814	816	Thanks, Maverick.
818	822	Maverick, Goose, come in here.- What the hell's going on?
822	826	- I don't know.- Shit.
830	834	Maverick, you just didan incredibly brave thing.
836	841	What you should have done was land your plane.You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do!
841	844	Son, your ego's writing chequesyour body can't cash.
845	849	You've been busted, you've lost yourqualifications as section leader three times.
850	854	Put in hack twice by mewith a history of high-speed passes...
854	858	...over five air control towersand one admiral's daughter!
858	863	- Penny Benjamin?- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.
864	865	Thank you, sir.
865	870	And let's not bullshit, Maverick.Your family name ain't the best in the Navy.
870	873	You need to be doing it betterand cleaner than the other guy,
873	874	now what is it with you?
875	878	Just want to serve my country, be thebest fighter pilot in the Navy, sir.
878	879	Don't screw around with me, Maverick.
880	882	You're a hell of an instinctivepilot. Maybe too good.
882	884	I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't...
884	886	...I got another problem here.
887	890	I gotta send somebody fromthis squadron to Miramar.
891	896	I gotta do something. I still can't believe it.I gotta give you your dream shot.
897	902	I'm gonna send you up against the best.You two characters are going to Top Gun.
904	907	For five weeks you're going to flyagainst the best pilots in the world.
908	913	You were number two. Cougar was number one.Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.
913	918	You guys are number one.But you remember one thing:
918	922	You screw up just this much,you'll be flying a cargo plane...
922	924	full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.
925	926	Yes, sir!
929	931	That is all.
932	936	Tell me about the MiG some other time.Gentlemen?
936	939	- Good luck, gentlemen.- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.
982	984	During Korea, the Navy kill ratio was 12 to 1.
984	987	We shot down 12 of theirjets for every one of ours.
988	993	During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3 to 1.Our pilots become dependant upon missiles.
993	995	They lost some of their dog-fighting skills.
995	1000	Now, Top Gun was created to teach ACM -'Air Combat Manoeuvring'. Dog-fighting.
1001	1002	- This gives me a hard-on.
1002	1005	By the end of Vietnam, thatratio was back to 12 to 1.
1005	1008	- Don't tease me.- Blinds, please.
1008	1010	I'd like to take thisopportunity to introduce you...
1010	1012	to our commanding officer at Top Gun.
1012	1014	...very first man to win theTop Gun trophy.
1015	1018	You will not find a finer fighterpilot anywhere in the world.
1018	1020	Commander Mike Metcalf.
1020	1024	- Call sign 'Viper.'- Gentlemen...
1024	1029	You're the top one percentof all naval aviators.
1031	1036	The elite. The best of the best.We'll make you better.
1037	1041	You fly at least two combat missionsa day, attend classes in between,
1041	1043	and evaluations of your performance.
1043	1046	On each combat sequence you'regonna meet a different challenge.
1047	1050	Every encounter is gonnabe much more difficult.
1051	1054	We're gonna teach you to fly the F-14right to the edge of the envelope,
1054	1055	faster than you've ever flown before.
1055	1058	And more dangerous.
1058	1064	Now, we don't make policy here, gentlemen.Elected officials, civilians, do that.
1064	1069	We are the instruments of that policy,and although we are not at war,
1069	1072	we must always act as though we are at war.
1072	1077	- What are you doing?- Just wondering who's the best.
1078	1083	In case some of you wonder who the best is,they're here on this plaque on the wall.
1083	1086	The best driver and his RIOfrom each class has his name on it.
1088	1094	And they have the option to come back hereto be Top Gun instructors.
1094	1097	You think your name'sgonna be on that plaque?
1098	1099	Yes, sir.
1100	1103	That's pretty arrogant,considering the company you're in.
1107	1108	Yes, sir.
1109	1111	I like that in a pilot.
1113	1118	Remember, when it's over out there,we're all on the same team.
1119	1125	Gentlemen, this school is about combat.There are no points for second place.
1126	1130	- Dismissed.- Nice going.
1131	1136	The plaque for the alternatesis down in the ladies' room.
1138	1142	Oh, Jesus... You kill me.You really do.
1145	1147	No, no, no. There'stwo O's in Goose, boys.
1161	1167	- This is what I call a target-rich environment.- You live your life between your legs, Mav.
1167	1170	Goose, even you could get laidin a place like this.
1170	1174	I'd be happy to find a girlwho'd talk dirty to me.
1178	1182	Mav, you wanted to know whothe best is? That's him. Iceman.
1184	1187	That's the way he flies.Ice-cold. No mistakes.
1187	1192	Just wears you down. You get bored, frustrated,you do something stupid, and he's got you.
1193	1197	Hey, hey, Slider. I thought you wantedto be a pilot, man. What happened?
1197	1200	Goose, you're suck a dickhead.Whose butt did you kiss to get here?
1200	1204	- The list is long but distinguished.- Yeah, so is my johnson.
1204	1207	- So you're flying with lceman, huh.- It's Mr. Iceman for you.
1207	1209	Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?
1209	1213	Doing good. Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.Tom Kazansky.
1213	1215	- Congratulations on Top Gun.- Thank you.
1215	1217	Sorry to hear about Cougar...
1217	1220	...you know, we were like brothersin fight school. He was a good man.
1220	1222	- Still is a good man.- Yeah, that's what I meant.
1223	1224	Thought so.
1224	1231	- So, you need any help? - With what?- You figured it out yet?
1231	1236	- What's that?- Who's the best pilot.
1236	1239	No, I think I can figurethat one out on my own.
1239	1241	I heard that about you.
1241	1243	You like to work alone.
1245	1247	Mav, you must've your soulunder a lucky star, huh?
1247	1250	I mean, first the MiG and thenyou slide into Cougar's spot...
1250	1252	We didn't slide into Cougar's spot,it was ours, ok.
1252	1256	Yeah well, some pilots wait awhole career to see a MiG up close.
1256	1258	Guess you guys are lucky and famous, huh.
1258	1264	- No, you mean notorious. I'll see you later.- You can count on it.
1265	1270	- They were abused children.- We're gonna have a good time. - Always.
1274	1280	Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?All right, the bet is 20 dollars.
1280	1286	You have to have carnal knowledge,of a lady this time, on the premises.
1286	1290	- On the premises.- Come on, Mav... a bet's a bet.
1290	1296	I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair...for you, I mean. But uh...
1297	1300	She's lost that loving feeling.
1300	1304	- She's los... No, she hasn't.- Yes, she has. - She has not lost that lo...
1304	1308	- Goose, she's lost it, man. Come on.- I hate it when she does that.
1314	1318	- Excuse me, miss.- Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry. I'll take care of this.
1319	1327	You never close your eyes anymorewhen I kiss your lips...
1327	1334	...there's no tenderness like beforein your fingertips...
1334	1339	You're trying hard not to show it,baby...
1339	1345	...but baby, believe me, I know that...
1345	1354	You lost that loving feeling,oh, that loving feeling.
1354	1361	You lost that loving feeling,now it's gone, gone, gone...
1368	1372	- Sit down.- Thank you.
1379	1386	I love that song. I've never seen that approach.How long have you two been doing this act?
1386	1390	- I don't know. Since uh...- Puberty? - Right, puberty.
1390	1394	- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.- I'm Maverick.
1394	1398	'Maverick'? Did your mothernot like you or something?
1398	1400	No, it's my call sign.
1400	1405	- You're a pilot!- That's right. A naval aviator.
1405	1410	- Actually, we've only done this twice.- Oh, how'd you do?
1410	1414	Crashed and burned on thefirst one, it wasn't pretty.
1414	1415	And the second?
1415	1420	I don't know, I'll tell you tomorrow.But it's looking good so far.
1422	1428	Well, 'Maverick'... my friend just arrived,so it's been great talking to you.
1429	1430	- Perry! - Hi.- Hi. Here you go.
1430	1434	I'll be with you in just a second, ok.
1435	1441	- Listen, can I ask you a personal question?- That depends.
1441	1447	- Are you a good pilot?- I can hold my own.
1448	1455	Great. Then I won't have to worry aboutyou making your living as a singer.
1460	1467	I'm gonna need a beer to put theseflames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.
1491	1495	- A long cruise, was it, sailor?- Too long.
1495	1499	What you wanna do, just drop bydown on the tile and go for it?
1500	1503	I actually had this counter in mind.
1504	1509	- That would be very, very comfortable, yeah.- It could be.
1511	1518	Actually, I came in here to save youfrom making a big mistake with that older guy.
1518	1524	Really? So I could go on to a bigger onewith a young guy like yourself?
1526	1528	Maybe.
1529	1534	- I have to get up early in the morning.- What are you doing?
1535	1540	Your friend was magnificent.
1546	1550	You'll also be trained and evaluatedby civilian specialists.
1550	1552	The civilians are hre becausethey are our very best...
1553	1555	source of information on enemy aircraft.
1555	1560	One of the most qualified is our call signCharlie. She has a Ph.D. in astrophysics.
1561	1564	And she's also a civilian contract,so you do not salute her.
1564	1566	But you better listen toher, because the Pentagon...
1566	1568	listens to her about your proficiency.
1568	1571	All yours, Charlie.
1572	1578	Hello. We will be dealing with F-5sand A-4s as our MiG simulators.
1578	1582	Now, then, as most of youknow, the F-5 doesn't have...
1582	1584	the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.
1584	1589	And it doesn't bleed energybelow 300 knots like the MiG-28.
1589	1595	However, the MiG-28 does havea problem with its inverted flight tanks.
1595	1598	It won't do a negative G push-over.
1599	1604	The latest intelligence tells usthe most it will do is 1 negative...
1604	1608	Excuse me, Lieutenant.Is there something wrong?
1608	1614	- Yes, ma'am. The data on the MiG is inaccurate.- How's that, Lieutenant?
1614	1619	- Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28...- We, we. - Sorry, Goose.
1619	1625	We happened to see a MiG-28do a 4 G negative dive.
1625	1628	Where did you see this?
1628	1630	- That's classified.- It's what?
1630	1634	It's classified. I could tell you,but then I'd have to kill you.
1634	1637	Lieutenant, I haveTop Secret clearance.
1638	1640	The Pentagon sees to itthat I know more than you.
1642	1647	- Well, ma'am, it doesn't seemso in this case now, does it?
1647	1650	So, Lieutenant... where exactly were you?
1650	1657	Well, we started up on his six when he pulledthrough the clouds. I went above him.
1657	1662	If you were directly above him,how could you see him?
1662	1666	- Because I was inverted.- Bullshit.
1666	1669	No, he was, man. It was a really great move.He was inverted.
1670	1675	You were in a 4 G inverted divewith a MiG-28?
1675	1678	- Yes, ma'am.- At what range?
1678	1679	About two metres?
1680	1684	Well, it was actually about 1/2, Ithink. I have a great Polaroid of it.
1684	1688	- It was a nice picture.- Lieutenant?
1690	1695	- What were you doing there?- Communicating. - Communicating.
1695	1699	Keeping up foreign relations.
1699	1704	- I was, you know, giving him the bird.- You know, the finger.
1704	1706	- I know the finger, Goose.
1706	1709	I'm sorry, I hate it whenit does that. I'm sorry.
1709	1713	- Excuse me.- So you're the one?
1713	1718	- Yes, ma'am.- All right, we have a hop to take.
1718	1724	The hard-deck on this hop will be 10,000 feet.There'll be no engagement below that.
1724	1726	Move it!
1730	1731	Lieutenant!
1734	1739	Okay, don't be late again.You look great, honey.
1739	1743	Lieutenant, why didn't you tell meyou were the famous MiG lnsulter?
1743	1746	- Would it have made any difference?- Not in the ladies' room, no.
1747	1749	And what would've?
1749	1752	I'm an instructor at thisschool, I see 20 new hotshots...
1752	1755	every eight weeks. Now, I'msure you can figure that out.
1756	1761	Look, Lieutenant. I'd just really liketo hear about the MiG sometime.
1762	1768	You've got security clearance.You read about it.
1772	1777	Maverick...I'm curious.
1778	1784	Who was covering Cougar while youwere showboating with this MiG?
1785	1787	Cougar was doing just fine.
1789	1792	Gentlemen, this is your first hop.The jets you're flying against are...
1792	1794	smaller and faster and more manoeuvreable.
1794	1797	Just like the enemy MiGs. Clockis ticking, and as of now...
1797	1798	we are keeping score.
1800	1804	- I lost him, Goose.- Show me what you've got, kid.
1805	1808	- I lost him.- I'm looking. I'm looking.
1810	1812	I got him, I got him.He's on our tail, coming hard.
1813	1814	I got him. Here we go.
1827	1829	Alright, talk to me, Goose.
1829	1832	He's still back there. He's closingin on us. He's closing fast.
1832	1834	You can run, kid, but you can't hide.
1839	1842	All right, Jester,I'll give you a run for your money here.
1848	1850	Watch the mountains!
1860	1863	I still got 'im, he's still back there.Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.
1864	1865	Yeah. I got him.
1876	1880	- Come on, bring it right.- I've had about enough of this shit.
1882	1885	- When I hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.- You're mine.
1893	1895	Jesus Christ!
1899	1903	- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.- Ok, man. Let's turn and burn.
1921	1925	- He's going vertical. So am l.- We're going ballistic, man. Go get him!
1935	1938	He's going for the hard-deck.Let's get down there first and nail him, Mav.
1938	1941	No way, Jester. You're mine.
1957	1958	I've got you now!
1962	1966	- Jester's dead.- Jester's dead.
1969	1972	Get your butts above the hard-deckand return to base.
1975	1978	Yes, sir!
1983	1986	Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
1986	1989	Negative, Ghost Rider. The pattern is full.
1990	1992	No, no, Mav. This is not a good idea.
1992	1995	Sorry, Goose... but it's time to buzz the tower.
2006	2009	Goddamn son of a bitch!
2013	2015	Great balls of fire.
2019	2022	- Jester's dead.- You won? Bullshit.
2022	2025	- Didn't everybody?- No, man. We got our butts kicked.
2025	2028	30 seconds. We went like this,he went like that...
2028	2033	...I said to Hollywood, 'Where did he go?'Hollywood said, 'Where did who go?'
2033	2037	- And he's laughing at us right onthe radio, he's laughing at us.
2037	2038	That was me laughing, dickhead. We won.
2039	2043	- All right!- They won too, man.
2043	2047	- That's not what I heard.- No, we did. We got Jester.
2047	2049	- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
2049	2052	Hard-deck my ass, we nailed that son of a bitch.
2052	2054	- You guys really are cowboys.- What's your problem, Kazansky?
2057	2058	You're everyone's problem.
2058	2061	That's because every time you goup in the air, you're unsafe.
2062	2067	- I don't like you because you're dangerous.- That's right, lceman.
2068	2070	I am dangerous.
2073	2075	Maverick. You and Goose getyour butts outta that...
2075	2077	flight gear and up to Viper's office, now!
2082	2086	Remember boys, no pointsfor second place.
2086	2090	- You're a lot brighter than you look.- You shut up. - Don't worry, don't worry.
2091	2095	Two of your snot-nosed jockeys did a fly-byat my tower at over 400 knots.
2095	2098	I want somebody's butt, Iwant it now, I've had it.
2100	2105	Goddamn it, that's twice.I want some butts!
2106	2111	- Well, that'll just about cover the fly-bys.- Follow me.
2116	2121	Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.
2124	2130	The hard-deck for this hop was10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.
2130	2138	You followed Commander Heatherlybelow after he lost sight of you. Why?
2138	2144	Sir, I had Commander Heatherly in my sights.He saw me move in for the kill...
2145	2148	...he then proceeded below the hard-deck.
2148	2152	We weren't below 10,000 formore than a few seconds.
2152	2155	I had the shot.There was no danger, so I took it.
2157	2162	You took it,and broke a major rule of engagement.
2162	2168	Then you broke another onewith that circus stunt fly-by.
2168	2171	Lieutenant Mitchell, Top Gunrules of engagement exist...
2171	2173	for your safety and for that of your team.
2173	2176	They're not flexible, nor am l.
2176	2180	Either obey them or youare history. Is that clear?
2182	2183	Yes, sir!
2192	2194	Dismissed.
2199	2204	I really enjoyed that, Mav,thanks a lot. Holy shit.
2208	2212	Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver.Mav, you got the number of that truck-driving
2212	2214	school that was on TV, TruckMaster, something like this?
2214	2215	I might need that.
2215	2220	State in those reports says it all.He's a wild card.
2220	2224	Completely unpredictable.
2224	2229	- He got you, didn't he?- Yeah.
2229	2234	Maverick. I flew with his old man.
2238	2242	Tell me one thing... ifyou had to go into battle,
2242	2244	- would you want him with you?- I don't know.
2245	2248	I just don't know.
2258	2262	- Still awake?- Yeah.
2265	2268	- What's up?- Can't sleep.
2270	2273	You kow, when I realisedwe were going to Top Gun,
2273	2276	all I could think about was getting that trophy.
2277	2282	I've got to be straight with you, Mav.Right now, I just hope we graduate.
2285	2289	I got a family to think about.I can't afford to blow this.
2292	2296	I guess that fly-bywasn't such a big hit, huh?
2299	2301	Look, man, I know it's tough for you.
2301	2305	The Academy rejected you becauseyou're Duke Mitchell's kid.
2305	2308	You have to live with that reputation.
2309	2313	But it's like everytime we go up there,it's like you're flying against a ghost.
2314	2318	It makes me nervous.
2321	2327	You're the only family I've got.I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.
2336	2340	Get out of here.
2355	2359	A rolling reversalwould work well in that situation.
2359	2363	If I reversed on a hard cross, I couldimmediately go to guns on him.
2363	2368	But at that speed, it's too fast.It's a little bit too aggressive.
2369	2372	Too aggressive?
2373	2377	Yeah, I guess when I seesomething, I go right after it.
2378	2381	You didn't tell me whoyou were the other night.
2381	2384	You didn't give me a chance,did you? You deserved it.
2386	2394	I know... but uh... you were tempted...to ask me out for dinner.
2394	2397	- No.- No? - No.
2398	2399	I don't date students.
2409	2415	I can see it's dangerous for you.But if the government trusts me...
2415	2417	...maybe you could.
2424	2427	It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.
2441	2445	Crash and burn, huh, Mav?
2447	2449	Slider...
2451	2454	You stink.
2463	2465	Let's go!
2545	2549	Come on, Mav. Just one more game.That evens it up.
2550	2554	- I got some things to take care of.- 'Take care of'? Just one more game.
2554	2560	- Please? For me? - I'm sorry.- You're sorry... Come on... For me?
2593	2596	Damn it.
2607	2609	Lieutenant?
2614	2619	- What? No singing?- Look, I'm...
2619	2622	No apologies.
2629	2632	If you don't mind, I'm... I'mjust gonna take a quick shower...
2632	2634	while you're finishing up here.
2636	2641	Yeah, I do mind. I'm hungry.
2644	2648	And then I thought about it.
2648	2652	I thought,'You know, he's a smart guy.'
2653	2659	'Why don't you just tell himwhy you've got him here?'
2660	2664	It's the MiG.
2666	2673	The MiG. You're the only pilotwho's been up against a MiG-28.
2674	2680	I'm trying for this big promotion.If I get it, I won't be here much longer.
2680	2684	Seems to me you've got it all figured out.
2686	2691	Except you did forget the wine.
2691	2693	Sorry.
2694	2699	- You always get what you want?- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.
2699	2704	Then relax about the MiG.
2717	2719	This music...
2721	2723	An old friend?
2725	2729	My folks loved it.I haven't heard this in years.
2731	2736	My mother used to call from her roomand have me play this over and over again...
2736	2739	...I got so sick of it.
2741	2747	But not her. She'd sit up there alone,just listening for hours.
2747	2754	Just listening.She died shortly after him.
2755	2758	What happened to your father?
2762	2768	I guess I kinda figured with your securityclearance you'd know more about it than I do.
2769	2772	Well, I didn't get that far.
2775	2778	Well, that's a big mystery.
2778	2783	He disappeared in an F-4,November 5th, 1965.
2785	2791	The stink of it was... he screwed up.
2791	2796	No way.My old man was a great fighter pilot.
2799	2803	But who the hell knows?It's all classified.
2805	2810	- Somebody must know.- Yeah, somebody knows everything.
2810	2815	Is that whyyou're always second best up there?
2815	2817	You are direct, aren't you.
2826	2830	I'm sorry I was late.
2830	2836	- I'm sorry for being direct.- No apologies.
2836	2842	This is going to be complicated.
2851	2856	- Where are you going?- I'm gonna take a shower.
2860	2865	Thank you. I enjoyed being here.
2902	2906	It looks like you need another shower.
2907	2909	Right.
2915	2918	I'm gonna be honest with you.
2918	2924	Your MiG sightingis really important to my work, but uh...
2928	2933	I don't normally invite studentsto my house. You're uh...
2941	2945	But please understand,I still have a job to do.
2971	2976	I'm glad we got that straight.
2992	2996	I told her how tough it is here. You know,my ass dragging like an old tired dog.
2997	3000	I told her you didn't evenhave a woman here.
3000	3004	She said, 'Oh, he probablydoesn't have 1, he's got 8.'
3009	3014	- Hi!- Daddy.
3020	3025	So, Maverick! Goose tells me you'rein love with one of your instructors.
3025	3026	Is that right?
3026	3032	I didn't tell her that. I can't believeyou said that. That was a secret.
3039	3044	The bogey has good position right here.Freeze frame. A moment of choice.
3045	3049	The F-14 is defensive.He has a chance to bug out right here.
3049	3056	Better to retire and save your aircraftthan push a bad position.
3056	3061	Charlie, jump in here any time. Now, you stayin that diamond another three seconds...
3061	3066	...the bogey's gonna blow you out in the sky.You take a hard right, select zone five...
3066	3071	...you can extend an escape.You made a bad choice.
3072	3079	- Charlie?- Aircraft one performs a split S?
3079	3083	That's the last thing you should do.The MiG's right on your tail.
3083	3087	Freeze there, please. TheMiG has you in his gunsight.
3087	3090	What were you thinking at this point?
3090	3095	You don't have time to think up there.If you think, you're dead.
3095	3100	That's a big gamble with a$30-million dollar plane,
3100	3101	Lieutenant.
3106	3111	Unfortunately, the gamble worked.The MiG never got a clean shot.
3112	3118	Maverick makes an aggressive verticalmove here, comes over the top, and he
3118	3124	The encounter was a victory, but I thinkwe have show it as an example of what not to do.
3126	3128	Next.
3128	3132	Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.
3134	3140	Now then, this is a perfect exampleof a textbook manoeuvre.
3152	3153	Lieutenant?
3166	3171	My review of your performance wasright on, in my professional opinion.
3171	3173	I can't hear you.
3194	3200	Jesus Christ! And you think I'm reckless!When I fly, my crew and my plane come first.
3200	3203	Well, I'm gonna finishmy sentence, Lieutenant.
3203	3206	My review of your flightperformance was right on.
3206	3207	- Is that right?- That is right.
3207	3209	But I held something back.
3209	3213	I see some real genius in your flying,Maverick, but I can't say that in there.
3213	3217	I was afraid that everyone in thattacts training would see right through me.
3217	3220	I just don't want anyoneto know that I've fallen for you.
3327	3331	- Hey, Maverick? You hear about lce?- What's that?
3331	3335	- He won another one.- Really? - Yeah.
3336	3340	- I fell the need......the need for speed.
3344	3350	Gentlemen, this is hop 19. Multiple aircraft,multiple bogeys. Your training is half-over.
3350	3355	The competltion for the Top Guntrophy remains tight. First place, lceman.
3355	3358	Second place, Maverick.Just two points behind.
3359	3363	There they are. Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.I don't think they see us yet.
3363	3367	Ok, I see them. Two A-4s.Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.
3376	3379	Good morning, gentlemen. Thetemperature is 110 degrees...
3380	3381	Holy shit! It's Viper!
3381	3385	Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.
3385	3388	Great. He's probably saying,'Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose.'
3388	3390	Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.
3393	3397	- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.- Roger, I've got the southern guy.
3399	3402	Hollywood, you got the lead,I'll cover you.
3414	3416	Break now, Jester.
3420	3423	Hollywood, we're losing Viper.Let's just stay on Jester.
3423	3424	Roger, I'm on 'im.
3428	3432	Goose, find Viper. He's out there somewhere.
3432	3435	Stay with Hollywood, Mav,we're covering his wing.
3436	3440	- Goose, there's Viper. Three o'clock low.- Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we're his cover.
3441	3445	- Don't you leave me, Mav.- Hollywood, you're looking good.
3445	3447	I'm going after Viper.
3450	3453	- Goddamn you, Maverick!- Mav, don't leave him.
3453	3457	Goose, Hollywood's okay.I want Viper.
3459	3462	Stand by.Viper's coming down.
3468	3472	Holy shit. We're head-to-head.I can't believe we're doing this.
3486	3489	Rock and roll! Here's our chance,it's a big one, Goose.
3492	3495	Come on, goddamn it.
3497	3500	Come on, keep coming.
3503	3507	Okay, sidewinder missile selected.Come on, baby.
3507	3510	Come on, Come around.That's it.
3516	3523	- Jesus, this guy's good. Where's he going?- Come on, come on. Keep coming.
3526	3530	Come on, baby.
3533	3536	Damn, this kid's good.
3536	3540	He's too close for missiles.I'm switching to guns.
3542	3545	Come on, come on.
3546	3549	Stick with it...
3552	3556	- Hold it. Check our tail.- Shit, there's Jester!
3556	3561	Bingo, Maverick's dead.You're out of there, kid.
3561	3564	The Defence Department regretsto inform you your sons...
3565	3566	are dead because they were stupid.
3567	3569	Great balls of fire.
3569	3573	Knock it off, gentlemen.Let's go home. Viper has the lead.
3579	3584	- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.- Shut up!
3585	3590	That was some of the best flying I've seen yet.Right up to the part where you got killed.
3590	3593	You never, never leave your wingman.
3600	3605	Maverick... It's not your flying,it's your attitude.
3607	3611	The enemy's dangerous, butright now you're worse than...
3611	3614	the enemy. You're dangerous and foolish.
3614	3621	You may not like who's flying with you, they maynot like you... but whose side are you on?
3629	3636	At least Viper got lceman beforehe got us. We've still got a shot at it.
3636	3642	That was stupid, I know better than that.That will never happen again.
3645	3646	I know...
3651	3653	I know.
3703	3708	Maverick, would you go fetch him.Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
3708	3714	- Goose? Hell no. Well, there was the time...- Admiral's daughter. - What? !
3714	3719	He told me all about the timeyou went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.
3720	3722	Did he? That's great...
3722	3728	He tells me about all of them. How mylil' angel Goose goes home early for church...
3728	3731	- ...and you! You always gohome with the hot women.
3731	3732	Alright. Thank you, Carole.
3733	3738	I'm gonna go embarrass myselfwith Goose for a while.
3754	3759	I'd love to be able to warn you off aboutMaverick, but I just love him to death.
3761	3766	I've known Pete for a lot of years now and...I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.
3766	3771	- There are hearts breaking wide openall over the world tonight. - Why?
3771	3776	Because, unless you are a fool,that boy is off the market.
3776	3781	He is 100% prime-time in love with you.
3782	3787	- Hey, Goose, you big stud. - That's me, honey.- Take me to bed or lose me forever.
3788	3789	Show me the way home, honey.
3791	3794	Come on, brother, sing with the family.
3826	3831	Maverick, you big stud...
3831	3835	Take me to bed or lose me forever.
3848	3851	Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.Two weeks to graduation.
3851	3855	The Top Gun trophyis still up for grabs, so
3898	3900	Well, it's bottom of thenight, the score is tied.
3900	3902	It's time for the big one.
3902	3907	- You up for this one, Maverick?- Just a walk in the park, Cazansky.
3910	3915	Contact. Multiple bogeys, 165. Two miles.Looks like they're going away from us.
3915	3919	- Oh, I see 'em. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.- I'm in.
3939	3942	That son of a bitch cut me off.
3949	3955	- Come on. Jesus Christ, lce, take the shot.- Come on, Ice. Get the hell out of there.
3956	3959	I can't get the angle. I'm too closefor missiles. I'm switching to guns.
3960	3962	Ice, fire or clear!
3967	3971	Look at this! Jesus Christ,I can take a shot right here.
3971	3973	I need another 20 seconds and I've got him.
3979	3981	I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
3981	3984	Come on, Mav, let's get in there. Come on, Mav!
3985	3987	Maverick's getting impatient.Now, come on, take the shot.
3987	3989	10 more seconds, then I've got 'im.
3991	3994	Come on, get the hell outof there. Let's do it, Mav.
3994	3996	Ice, Come off my right. I'm in.
3996	3999	- Five more seconds.- Come off my right. I'm in.
3999	4001	I'm off. Shit.
4004	4006	We're in a jetwash. Shit!
4010	4013	This is not good. Shit,we've got a flame-out, Mav.
4013	4015	Engine one is out... Engine two is out.
4016	4019	I'm losing control. I can't control it!
4023	4027	It's coupling up. This is not good!
4027	4031	Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!
4034	4038	Altitude 8,000... 7,000...
4038	4041	We're at 6,000!
4043	4045	I can't reach the ejection handle!
4048	4054	- You're gonna have to punch us out.- I can't reach the ejection handle!
4054	4058	- Eject...- Watch the canopy!
4075	4077	Goose... Oh, no!
4081	4083	Oh, God.
4131	4134	Sir, let go of him.You've got to let him go, sir.
4178	4181	- How are you doing?- I'm all right.
4184	4188	- Goose is dead.- I know.
4191	4195	You fly jets long enough,something like this happens.
4196	4200	He was my RIO, my responsibility.
4202	4208	In my squadron in Vietnam,we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.
4208	4215	The first one dies, you die too.But there will be others.
4215	4218	You can count on it.
4219	4222	You've got to let him go.
4223	4226	You've got to let him go.
4243	4247	I think maybe it was my fault.
4248	4250	I don't know.
4251	4255	I don't know what the hell went wrong.
4255	4260	I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.
4266	4269	God, I want him back.
4274	4277	I'll be here if you need me, okay?
4390	4394	God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.
4411	4417	He would have flown anyway...without you.
4417	4421	He'd've hated it,but he would have done it.
4442	4445	We find that the F-14 flatspinwas induced by the...
4445	4448	disruption of air flowinto the starboard engine.
4449	4452	This disruption stalled the engine...

4547	4551	- Hey! Where the hell are you going?- It's not good. It doesn't look good.
4551	4555	What do you mean, 'it doesn't look good'?It doesn't get to look any better than that.

4700	4703	- May l?- Please.
4712	4717	I'll have what he's having.Hemlock, is it?
4718	4720	Ice water.
4724	4726	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
4728	4733	I heard you got that job in Washington.Congratulations.
4735	4740	Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leavewithout saying goodbye.
4744	4748	- It's good to see you.- Thanks.
4750	4756	Where are you going?You don't even have a ticket, do you?
4757	4761	Listen, I've seen all the evidence,and it's not your responsibility.
4762	4763	It's not your fault.
4765	4769	You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.
4769	4773	What you do up there... It's dangerous.
4774	4779	- But you've got to go on.- You don't understand.
4780	4785	When I first met you,you were larger than life.
4787	4789	Look at you.
4790	4793	You're not gonna be happyunless you're going Mach 2...
4793	4795	with your hair on fire, you know that.
4796	4798	No, that's over. It's just over.
4799	4802	To be the best of the best meansyou make mistakes and then...
4802	4805	you go on, it's just like the rest of us.
4805	4808	You don't think I know that?
4810	4812	I'm here to help.
4813	4820	Look, thank you. But if I'd wanted help,really... I would have asked for it.
4827	4829	So, I'm too late.
4831	4832	You've already left.
4834	4837	You didn't learn a damn thing,did you?
4838	4839	Except to quit.
4843	4846	You've got that manoeuvre downreal well.
4853	4856	So long, Pete Mitchell.
4881	4885	Oh, hi, Maverick, come on in.How are you doing?
4886	4887	- Good- Yeah? Sure you're feeling okay?
4887	4888	- Fine.- Great.
4888	4892	- Jamie, come on. Can I get you adrink or anything else like that?
4892	4892	No, thank you.
4893	4894	- Ok, why don't you just uh...- Thank you very much.
4895	4897	- Make yourself comfortable, 'cuzMike will be right down, ok?
4897	4898	Ok. Thank you.
4917	4922	I flew with your old man.VF-51, the Oriskany.
4924	4929	You're a lot like he was.Only better...
4930	4931	...and worse.
4933	4937	He was a natural heroic son of a bitch,that man.
4940	4943	So he did do it right.
4947	4949	Yeah, he did it right.
4959	4963	Is that why you fly the way you do?Trying to prove something?
4965	4968	Yeah, your old man did it right.
4969	4973	What I'm about to tell you is classified.It could end my career.
4974	4977	We were in the worst dogfight everdreamed of.
4977	4981	There were... bogeys like firefliesall over the sky.
4983	4986	His F-4 was hit, he was wounded,but he could have made it back.
4986	4990	He stayed in it,saved three planes before he bought it.
4992	4996	- How come I never heard that before?
4996	5000	The battle occurred overthe wrong line on some map.
5001	5004	- So you were there?- I was there.
5005	5007	What's on your mind?
5009	5011	My options, sir.
5012	5016	Simple.First, you've acquired enough points...
5016	5019	...to show up tomorrow and graduatewith your Top Gun class.
5020	5022	Or you could quit.
5023	5027	There'll be no disgrace. That spin was hell,it would have shook me up.
5027	5031	- So you think I should quit?- I didn't say that.
5032	5036	The simple fact is, youfeel responsible for Goose.
5036	5038	And you have a confidence problem.
5039	5043	I'm not gonna sit here and blow sunshineup your ass, Lieutenant.
5043	5047	A good pilot is compelledto always evaluate what's happened...
5047	5050	...so he can apply what he's learned.
5051	5056	Up there, we've got to push it.That's our job.
5058	5063	It's your option, Lieutenant.All yours.
5074	5078	Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, butthank you very much for your time.
5078	5081	No problem. Good luck.
5130	5134	- Gentlemen...- Where's Maverick?
5134	5140	- I don't know where he is.- You know what he's planning to do?
5141	5144	It's got to be hard on the guy,though, you know.
5175	5178	- Congratulations.- Thank you.
5180	5183	- Congratulations.- Thanks, Mav. - Sir.
5186	5192	Gentlemen, I hate to break up the partybefore it really gets out of hand...

5237	5240	become disabled and has wanderedinto foreign territory.
5240	5244	A rescue operation is to beginwithin the hour. Your mission is...
5244	5246	to give air support to that rescue.
5246	5250	There are MiGs in the area,and tensions are high.
5250	5253	If you witness a hostileact, you will return fire.
5254	5256	Those MIGs carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
5256	5259	They can fire that missilefrom a 100 miles away.
5259	5265	Gentlemen, this is the real thing.This is what you've been trained for.
5266	5271	You are America's best. Make us proud.Ice... Hollywood, sector two.
5271	5275	Maverick, you back them up with Merlinon ready five.
5276	5279	- Yes, sir.- Rise.
5281	5284	Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.
5284	5287	But with regard to Maverick...is he the best pilot to..?
5287	5290	- I know what's on your mind,Cazansky, just get on it.

5373	5377	Voodoo One, Voodoo One. 090,radar contact 15 miles.
5377	5378	They're doing 500 knots.
5379	5381	Roger, that's your bogey.

5395	5399	They're at 15,000 feet now,dead ahead, 10 miles.
5399	5404	800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.
5404	5409	- Wood, you got 'em? - Not yet, I can't see 'em.- They must be close. I'm getting a hard-on.
5416	5419	Ok, Wood, I'm taking thelead. Let's identify 'em.
5419	5423	Roger, Ice. You got the lead, I'mon your leftside, a little low.

5429	5433	My bogey's still locked up.He's drifting to the left.
5433	5435	Still manoeuvring, course 090.
5435	5440	Ok, Wood. Let's bring it to the right,and we'll get a better angle on 'im.
5449	5453	Ice, we've got a problem here.Now I have four aircraft on radar,
5453	5455	not 1 pair, 2 pairs. Repeat, 4 bogeys.

6228	6231	Hello, Pete Mitchell.
6234	6239	I heard the best of the bestwere gonna be back here, so...
6244	6246	This could be complicated.
6248	6252	You know,on the first one, I crashed and burned.
6253	6255	And the second?
6262	6263	I don't know.
