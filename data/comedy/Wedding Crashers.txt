4	6	- I don't have custody of the kids. - Yeah.
6	8	- You know what? - I don't get custody.
8	9	It is an insane pathetic joke, what I've had to go through.
9	11	Right now, right now she doesn't know where the kids are, do you?
11	13	- Do not talk about me as a mother. - Are they at home?
13	14	I'm so sick to death of you talking about me as a mother
14	15	- and what I've done wrong! - They at your sister's? Where...
16	17	they're probably at a firehouse somewhere. She'd just drop 'em off
17	19	- with a fireman, you know? - Do not talk about that!
19	20	I am sick of you accusing me of not being a good mother!
20	22	- Are they at home? Are they at home? - Seven years I've been a good mother!
22	24	A perfect mother? I can't have custody.
24	26	Just remember when we went out. Just remember how you...
26	28	Right now. Where is Tim right fucking now?
28	30	Don't you talk about me being a mother. I hate you!
30	33	Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you just kiss my left nut?
33	35	- I told you this was a bad idea. - You know what, Ken?
35	38	A bad idea would be to let your client walk outta here today and drag
38	42	this thing out for another year, wasting more time and wasting more money.
42	45	The only good idea is to let me and John do our job
45	48	- and mediate this thing right here. - You wanna hear the crazy thing?
48	50	I know it doesn't feel like it, but we're making progress.
50	53	- Mm-hmm. - We settled the deal with the cars.
53	55	Let's see, that takes us to frequent flyer miles. We're flying!
55	56	- Those are mine. - I want them.
56	58	You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna split 'em right down the middle.
58	62	- How'd that be, Mr. Kroger? - It would be no-not good at all!
62	64	- I earned those miles! - Yeah, you earned them flying
64	66	- to Denver to meet your whore. - Oh, Lord.
66	68	Well, she's not afraid to express herself sexually
68	71	- if that's what you mean. - She's a stripper, for God's sake!
71	73	- She is not! - Her name is Chastity!
73	76	She is white trash! Same as you.
76	78	Hillbilly!
78	80	That's it, go comatose for me, baby.
80	83	You shut your mouth when you're talkin' to me!
83	85	Hold it. This is getting confusing.
85	87	You didn't always hate each other.
88	90	There had to be some nice moments, during the courtship, maybe?
90	92	- Or the wedding? - The wedding had to be fun!
92	94	- You have your families together. - You have your decorations.
94	97	Families coming together. That's a nice moment.
97	98	- What'd you have to eat? - Crab cakes.
99	100	- Are you kidding me? Crab c... how could you not have a good time
100	103	- eating crab cakes? I love 'em. - Crab cakes, I love crab cakes.
103	104	- They're phenomenal. - And did you have a band?
104	106	- Did you have a band? Good or bad? - Yeah.
106	108	Who gives a shit? It's a great band, it's a bad band, it's like pizza, baby.
108	110	- It's good no matter what. - That's true. You got them...
110	112	- There's music in the air! ...playing "Shout" and you hate it.
112	115	- Yeah. # Oh-oh-oh-oh-hey # - # A little bit softer now #
115	117	- # Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey # - # Shout now, jump up and shout now. #
117	119	It's a good time, do you know what I mean?
119	120	- Yeah. - Rubbin' up against each other,
120	123	just a couple of kids who like to fuck, trying to make it honest. I get it.
123	127	Guys, the real enemy here is the institution of marriage.
127	130	It's not realistic, it's crazy! Hey, don't do this
130	132	for the other person. It's about saying yes to yourself
132	133	- and saying yes to your future. - Say yes.
134	136	And have some opportunities for yourself. I'm sure you'd love
136	139	to be free, maybe go out and meet some Latin guy that can dance,
139	142	grind up on you, make you feel dangerous but also safe.
142	144	And how about you? Don't you want to get inside Chastity
144	146	without having to wonder if everyone's gonna find out?
146	148	- God, wouldn't that be sweet? - Wouldn't that be nice?
148	150	And have some Latin guy sweating all over you,
150	152	talking to you in languages you don't understand,
152	156	- needing you, wanting you, taking you? - All we're trying to say is,
156	159	put your swords away for a second.
159	161	Let's finish this and let's move on.
161	164	Get out there and get some strange ass.
164	167	Could you give her a glass of water so she can take that?
171	174	Hey, John, that's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
175	179	Wow, now that you mention it, it is half full.
181	183	He can have the miles.
183	187	Nah, sweetie, you take the miles.
187	190	Great. Great! Let's sign the paperwork and we are done!
190	192	This is just semantics. If you guys want to throw a couple miles at us,
192	195	we'll take a couple. The big this is, is that we're all movin' on.
195	198	Could you two just not talk anymore?
211	213	Oh, good, you got it. Is it 100% goose down?
213	215	- Yes. Why do you need this? - Are you sure?
215	218	I sleep over at John's house every year for his birthday.
218	219	Okay, that's not creepy.
220	221	I guess it is a little creepy
221	224	when a young man who happens to be an only child
224	227	loses both of his parents in a tragic accident
227	229	one month before his birthday
229	231	and then has a best friend make a vow
231	233	that he will never spend his birthday alone again.
234	237	Maybe that would fall under the category of creepy.
237	239	Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
239	242	- That's okay. - No, you're really sweet.
242	243	I've got the perfect girl for you.
243	246	Janice, I apologize to you if I don't seem real eager
246	249	to jump into a forced, awkward intimate situation
249	252	that people like to call dating. I don't like the feeling.
252	254	You're sitting there, you're wondering, "Do I have food on my face?
254	257	Am I eating? Am I talking too much? Are they talking enough? Am I interested?
257	258	I'm not really interested. Should I play like I'm interested?
258	260	But I'm not that interested, but I think she might be interested.
260	262	But do I want to be interested? But now she's not interested."
262	264	So now, all of sudden I'm... I'm starting to get interested.
264	266	And when am I supposed to kiss her? Do I have to wait for the door?
266	268	'Cause then it's awkward, it's like "Well, good night."
268	271	Do you do like the ass-out hug? Where you like... you hug each other like this,
271	273	and the ass sticks out because you're trying not to get too close.
273	276	Or do you go right in and just kiss 'em on the lips or don't kiss 'em at all?
276	278	It's very difficult trying to read the situation and all the while
278	280	you're just really wondering, "Are we gonna get hopped enough to make
281	284	some bad decisions?" And perhaps play a little game called "Just the Tip."
284	286	Just for a second, just to see how it feels,
286	289	- or "Ouch Ouch, You're on My Hair." - Okay.
289	292	Okay, can... can you... can you put that so he... he can't see it?
292	295	And thank you. Hey, Janice. Great talk.
297	299	- John? - Yeah?
299	301	I gotta see you right away, it's important.
303	305	What's going on?
306	309	We've got three really big weeks ahead of us.
309	310	It's wedding season, kid!
311	312	You sandbagging son of a bitch!
313	314	I got us down for 17 of them already.
314	316	Okay, now, how many of 'em are cash bars?
316	319	Great question, love where your head's at, and two of 'em actually are.
319	321	But... I got us covered.
322	325	Purple hearts. We won't have to pay for a drink all night.
325	327	Oh yeah, perfect.
327	330	We are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous ladies
330	331	that are so aroused by the thought of marriage,
331	333	that they'll throw their inhibitions to the wind.
333	334	And who's gonna be there to catch 'em?
334	336	Grab that net and catch that beautiful butterfly, pal!
336	339	What do you like better? Christmas or wedding season?
339	342	- Mr. Grey. - Yes, um, the answer would be, um...
342	344	- wedding season? - Bingo.
344	346	I'm gonna go get my suit. Oh, now who are we this time?
352	355	Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet a real mensch, Chuck Schwartz.
355	357	Oh, stop.
364	368	And as we carry on the tradition of thousands of years,
368	370	we honor the eternal bond
370	372	that stretches through the ages.
373	375	I have known this couple for many years.
375	379	Deborah I've actually known for her entire life.
379	383	I was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital,
383	387	and I was there the day she graduated from medical school.
387	389	Josh I have known since his bar mitzvah,
389	392	which those of you who were there
392	395	know it was not a very pretty sight.
395	397	But he has pulled himself together nicely,
397	403	and he's grown into a remarkable young man himself.
403	405	- Okay. - He never got the courage
405	410	to ask her out, until 10 years later. Josh was in the emergency room,
410	412	and he saw Debra again
412	414	- and he said to himself... - Hi.
414	416	"Wait! That's the girl I'm going to marry!"
418	421	I now pronounce you man and wife.
421	424	Mazel tov!
424	428	Mazel tov, baby! From my family to yours, mazel tov. Beautiful.
434	436	# Hava nagila #
436	438	# Hava nagila #
438	441	# Hava nagila, ba ba ba! #
443	444	Oh my.
444	447	You sly son of a bitch.
447	451	# Nagila, hava nagila ve'nismecha #
451	453	# Hava nagila, hava... #
453	455	Does anyone know what this here is used for?
455	458	- Rolling a fatty. - No, not...
458	459	not for... where'd you learn that?
459	461	You want to get a whole combination.
461	463	You gotta get the frostings in the middle and on the other end.
463	466	- # Ba-ba ba ba # - That's it, that's it, that's it,
466	468	that's it! Come on!
468	471	You both look beautiful up there today,
471	473	particularly Debbie in that white dress. Enjoy it. After tomorrow,
473	478	I don't think you're gonna be able to get away with wearing a white dress.
478	480	Here, I'll just pick this off,
480	482	I'll go grab another piece. That's it.
484	486	- Ooh! - Whoa.
486	488	In the words of the old country...
488	490	- L'chaim! - L'chaim!
500	502	Come here!
502	504	I want you to take this note, bring it to that blonde girl.
504	506	Hurry, 'cause I'm gonna time you. Go!
508	511	Hi.
511	513	Who gave this to you?
516	518	You know, I saw you at the wedding.
518	520	- And? - You were crying.
520	522	Oh, shit. You weren't supposed to see that.
522	524	Now you probably think I'm a big pussy.
524	526	No, you were so sweet. Come here.
527	530	Look, I knew I was never gonna be a professional bullfighter,
530	533	- but that's not why I did it. - Weren't you scared?
533	535	Can I say yes?
545	547	- Sanjay Collins. - Chuck Vindaloo,
547	549	excited to be here.
549	551	- Shamus O'Toole. - Bobby O'Shea.
551	553	- And we're gonna get drunk. - Ha-ha!
553	557	# Keep it comin', love, keep it comin', love... #
557	559	- Who is that? - Uh, him.
559	562	Uh, I think that's his kid Leonard. The diabetic.
562	565	- Who is that? - That's Luigi and Gina's
565	567	son Christopher. You know, the banker.
567	571	Oh, that's Mae Lin's adopted son Benny, the veterinarian.
571	573	The French Foreign Legion?
573	577	Yeah. We lost a lot of good men out there.
577	579	Wow, really? Mount Everest?
579	581	I just don't like to talk about it
581	582	because we lost so many good men out there.
583	584	Oh!
584	587	Lost so many good men out there.
587	589	Playing with the Yankees?
590	592	Yes, with the Yankees.
592	595	You lose good men to trades and unruly fans.
595	597	L... look, I don't want to talk about it, I'm sorry.
599	601	It's just a matter of trying to get it down.
601	604	Tattoo on the lower back. Might as well be a bull's-eye.
604	607	You know how they say we only use 10% of our brains?
607	612	- Mmm. - I think we only use 10% of our hearts.
612	615	I feel so tiny in your arms.
615	617	Really? How tall are you?
618	620	I'm 6'5", but...
620	622	I feel like I'm four feet.
622	625	And some poetry, courtesy of Sarah McLachlan.

669	671	Great guy. He brung me along, too.
675	678	Jesus. Come on! Get in there. You can do it!
678	681	You want that cake! You don't treat cake like that.
681	683	- You gotta treat cake like a lady. - Give her a kiss. Look at that.
683	686	Oh my God, in front of all of 'em!
686	689	Ba ba ba. Ah-ha-ha! Oh-ho!
691	694	And then everyone said, "Jabroni!"
696	699	Jabroni! This fucking guy, unbelievable!
699	702	Hop in.
702	704	Now spread it around on each other.

794	795	Oh, no no.
795	797	Oh, I'm sorry.
797	800	Sarah, I feel like I don't even know you.
800	802	It's Vivian.
806	810	Would you say you're completely full of shit or just 50%?
810	813	I hope just 50, but who knows?
827	829	Ah.
830	833	Bet that blonde was a real shot of life.
833	835	Yeah, real shot.
837	839	You don't think we're being...
839	842	I don't want to say sleazy, 'cause that's not the right word,
842	844	but a little irresponsible, maybe?
844	846	No!
846	848	One day, you'll look back on all this and laugh,
848	851	say we were young and stupid.
851	852	Yeah.
852	854	A couple of dumb kids running around.
856	858	We're not that young.
871	873	Hell of a season, pal.
873	875	Hell of a season.
882	885	Oh! Baba ganoush.
885	887	What do we got?
887	888	Christmas come early.
890	893	- Secretary Cleary? - The Secretary of the Treasury.
893	896	The guy you loved since business school. Don't thank me.
896	898	I don't know. I mean, I thought the season was over.
898	900	I was looking forward to kinda taking a break for a little bit.
900	901	John, what are you talking about?
901	903	This is the Kentucky Derby of weddings.
903	905	It's the Clearys. They're an American institution.
905	909	Pal, there's gonna be over 200 single women at this wedding.
909	911	Not to mention, if you look here, they've got three live bands,
911	913	they got oysters, snacks, phenomenal finger food.
913	917	I'm tired, okay? My feet hurt. My voice is hoarse.
917	919	Oh, please don't take a turn to negative town.
919	921	What are you talking about? Who's getting negative?
921	924	Well, at the Buckner nuptials you were sitting and sulking in the corner.
924	926	I wasn't sulking. I twisted my ankle.
926	928	Rule #6:
928	929	Do not sit in the corner and sulk;
930	931	it draws attention to you in a negative way.
932	934	Draw attention to yourself, but on your own terms.
934	935	Please don't quote the rules to me, I know them.
935	939	When Chazz Reinhold passed the sacred rules of wedding crashing onto us
939	942	12 years ago, he gave us a legacy.
942	944	You make it sound like a cult, okay?
944	946	And from everything you've told me about Chazz, he sounds like a kook!
946	950	You bite your tongue. Chazz Reinhold is not a kook!
950	952	He is a brave and a decent man. He is a pioneer!
952	955	He lived with his mother till he was 40! She tried to poison his oatmeal!
955	957	Erroneous! Erroneous.
957	959	Erroneous on both counts!
959	961	- Oh, Lord. Here we go again. - What you should be worried about
961	964	is not Chazz Reinhold, who is in the hall of fame.
964	967	What you should be worried about is you're getting sloppy.
967	970	Now, if you sit there and expect me to go out on a limb
970	973	and try to pull off the greatest crash of all time,
973	975	I gotta know that your head's right.
976	979	There is no room for error.
979	981	Secret Service. Consequences.
982	984	I love your enthusiasm.
984	987	If I do this, I don't wanna half-ass it.
987	988	I want it well planned.
989	991	He's back!
991	993	All right, partner. We'll start scheming tonight, okay?
993	995	- Sounds good. - If you need me, I'll be on line six.
995	997	Okay.
1000	1002	Could be fun.
1013	1015	- Wow. - Mr. Senator.
1015	1017	- Congratulations, Kathleen. - Thank you.
1017	1019	- Bill, congratulations. - Thank you, Senator.
1019	1021	Secretary, they just grow up so damn fast.
1021	1022	That's the truth.
1022	1026	- Okay. Let's do our pregame. - What do you got?
1026	1030	A few articles on Secretary Cleary's economic policies.
1030	1033	There's also a roster of key family members, a glossary, sailing terms.
1033	1035	- Sailing? - Sailing's like sex to these people.
1035	1038	- They love it. - Harvard, Kennedy School of Government,
1038	1040	Mom's big with charities, blah blah blah.
1040	1042	Three daughters, one son. I get it. Good work.
1042	1044	Good.
1059	1061	Let me see that again, please.
1061	1063	Handsome.
1063	1065	Okay, what's our back story?
1065	1068	We're brothers from New Hampshire, we're venture capitalists.
1068	1070	I'm sick of that!
1070	1072	Let's be from Vermont
1072	1074	and let's have an emerging maple syrup conglomerate.
1074	1077	Wait, that's stupid. We don't know anything about maple syrup.
1077	1079	I happen to know everything there is to know about maple syrup.
1079	1081	I love maple syrup. I love maple syrup on pancakes.
1081	1084	I love it on pizza. I like to take maple syrup and put a little bit in my hair
1084	1086	when I've had a rough week. What do you think holds it up, slick?
1086	1089	It's the first quarter of the big game and you want to toss up a Hail Mary!
1089	1091	I'd like to be pimps from Oakland or cowboys from Arizona,
1091	1095	but it's not Halloween! Grow up, Peter Pan! Count Chocula!
1095	1097	Look, we been to a million weddings.
1097	1099	And guess what? We've rocked 'em all!
1105	1107	Great day.
1107	1109	- The Eagle has landed. - The big show.
1109	1112	Hey, hey. Fifth row back with the fancy hat.
1113	1115	I like that.
1115	1118	No, don't waste your time on girls with hats, they tend to be very proper.
1118	1121	Yeah?
1121	1124	The proper girl in the hat just eye-fucked the shit outta me.
1125	1127	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
1127	1131	Why don't you say it a little louder? I don't think the priest heard you.
1131	1134	Look, John, I'm sorry I'm not sorry, okay?
1134	1136	I'm not gonna apologize. I'm a cocksman.
1138	1140	- Tourette's. - Frank Myers.
1140	1142	John Ryan. Say hello to my brother Jeremy.
1142	1146	Hi, how are you? So, um, how do you know the groom?
1146	1149	- We are Uncle Ned's kids. - Mm-hmm.
1149	1151	Uncle Ned.
1151	1154	- Is he Liz's brother? - Uncle Ned, the brother of Aunt Liz.
1154	1156	How is everybody?
1156	1158	Well, Dad kinda putters around the house.
1158	1161	Hey, Aunt Liz sends her best. She couldn't make it.
1161	1163	Uh, yeah, I know. Uh, ah...
1163	1165	she's dead.
1166	1168	From the grave.
1168	1170	She sends her best from the grave.
1170	1172	We've become extremely spiritual
1172	1174	- ever since she passed. - I see.
1174	1176	But thank you so much for your kindness, brother.
1176	1179	Lord knows we need family now more than ever.
1179	1181	- You're welcome. - Thank you.
1184	1186	How many times are you gonna do this shit?
1186	1188	Rule #32: You don't commit to a relative
1189	1191	unless you're absolutely positive that they have a pulse.
1191	1193	Rule 16: Give me an up-to-date family tree.
1193	1196	That was your mistake. You made me look like an idiot.
1196	1198	Rule #76: No excuses, play like a champion.
1209	1211	Hello, Red.
1213	1215	- Dibs. - She's all yours.
1217	1219	I ain't gonna fight you.
1242	1244	I think we've got a crier.
1244	1247	- No shot. - $20.
1247	1249	- Make it 40. - Done.
1252	1253	Oh, are you kidding me?
1254	1256	It's beautiful. It's moving. It's a wedding.
1256	1258	And now for our next reading,
1258	1262	I'd like to ask the bride's sister Gloria
1262	1264	up to the lectern.
1264	1266	$20, 1 Corinthians.
1266	1268	Double or nothing, Colossians 3:12.
1271	1274	And now a reading from Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians.
1274	1278	"Love is patient, love is kind."
1278	1281	As you all know, Craig and Christina
1281	1284	are quite the sailing enthusiasts.
1284	1285	In that light,
1286	1288	they have elected to exchange vows
1288	1290	which they themselves have written.
1291	1293	The ring.
1294	1296	I, Craig,
1296	1298	take you, Christina, to be my wife,
1298	1302	my best friend and my first mate...
1303	1308	through sickness and health, clear skies and squalls.
1310	1312	I'm sorry, I have a tickle in my throat.
1313	1317	I, Christina, take you, Craig,
1317	1318	to be my best friend,
1318	1321	and my captain...
1322	1325	to be your anchor and your sail...
1325	1327	Well, this is a first.
1327	1330	...your starboard and your port.
1330	1335	And now I pronounce you husband and wife.
1335	1337	You may kiss the first mate.
1379	1381	Sorry, just... just a sampler.
1381	1383	Told you this would be classy, right?
1383	1387	Yes, you did, class, first class all the way. You were not lying.
1387	1388	Class class class.
1392	1394	They've got some kind of seasoning on here.
1394	1395	It must be sprinkled.
1396	1398	Okay, go get us seats near, but not too near, the bridal party.
1398	1401	I'm going to go drop this box of fresh Wyoming air.
1401	1404	If you see any crab cakes, get your hands on some
1404	1406	- 'cause I love the crab cakes. - Consider it done.
1411	1414	- Fondue set. - Excuse me?
1414	1416	The present you're holding is a sterling silver fondue set.
1416	1419	- John Ryan. - Claire Cleary.
1419	1421	Uh, so how do you know that?
1421	1424	Well... I'm a psychic.
1424	1426	- You're psychic? - I am.
1426	1428	- Really? - Yes.
1428	1430	- What's that one? - Knife set. German. Very nice.
1430	1432	Hmm. And that?
1432	1434	- Cotton linens, Egyptian. - Ooh.
1434	1437	- What about that? - Oh, I'll go all day. Place settings,
1437	1440	candlesticks, crystal stemware which they'll probably never use
1440	1442	'cause it's... crystal stemware.
1442	1445	- Okay, how about that? - This...
1445	1448	uh... massage oils and a book on tantra
1448	1450	from the wacky aunt.
1453	1455	Let's check.
1455	1457	- Who's it from? - Aunt Millie.
1457	1460	- Yes! - Well, you... you have a gift.
1460	1463	I know. Unfortunately my powers only apply to useless consumer products.
1463	1466	Well, you know, if the police are missing a Belgian waffle maker
1466	1468	you could, um, give 'em a hand.
1470	1472	- Claire, we need you for pictures. - Oh, okay.
1472	1474	- Who's your friend? - This is John Ryan.
1474	1477	- Hello. - Excuse us.
1479	1482	Could I just have one more of the samplers here?
1482	1484	- Good. - What have we got?
1484	1486	Come back with some more stuff.
1486	1489	That's good, though. These bacon-wrapped scallops, phenomenal.
1489	1491	Okay, so what angle you gonna play here?
1491	1494	I'm gonna go with the balloon-animal display for the kids,
1494	1496	and then when she comes close to check it out, guess who's a broken man?
1496	1498	- Haunted past, that's it. - Haunted past. Excellent.
1498	1500	- How about you? - I'm gonna dance with
1500	1502	the little flower girl or I might be a charter member of Oprah's Book Club.
1502	1504	- It's all deadly. - Yes.
1504	1505	I'll see you in a little.
1505	1508	Final touch. There it is.
1508	1512	One happy elephant. All right.
1512	1514	Who else wants something?
1514	1515	I want a bicycle.
1516	1519	A bicycle? Well, a bicycle, that would take a lot of balloons
1519	1521	and honestly Uncle Jeremy's a little tired right now
1521	1524	so why don't we do something like, uh... let's say a giraffe?
1524	1526	I just want a bicycle!
1529	1530	Why-why are you yelling at me?
1530	1532	Whatever, make me a bicycle, clown!
1539	1540	I'm gonna make you a bicycle.
1540	1542	But I don't want to make you a bicycle.
1542	1544	Shut your mouth, funny guy, and make it!
1547	1549	You got it.
1549	1551	There you go.
1551	1553	Yeah, you got it.
1564	1566	Let's see how you do with somebody your own age.
1566	1568	I think I'm up to the challenge.
1568	1570	All right, will you save me a dance for later?
1570	1573	- Maybe. - Okay.
1585	1587	Go on, take it, you hyena.
1587	1589	Don't say thank you.
1589	1591	Hi. You're good.
1591	1594	That thing? I'm just warming up. Last week I did a, uh,
1594	1596	exact replica of... to scale... of Wrigley Field.
1596	1598	- Ha! - Honest to God.
1598	1601	- I don't have anywhere to put it. - Okay, then I'll take a sportscar.
1601	1603	How about a dance?
1603	1605	That's what I really wanted.
1635	1638	So how long have you and the Secretary been married?
1638	1640	30 years next April.
1640	1641	Oh, that's beautiful.
1641	1644	Yeah, and we were faithful for two of them.
1644	1647	- Hmm? - Enjoy the party.
1651	1655	- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary. - Thanks.
1658	1660	Secretary Cleary, John Ryan.
1660	1662	- Hi, John. - I just wanted to tell you how much
1663	1666	I enjoyed your position paper on economic expansion in Micronesia.
1666	1669	You've read my position paper?
1669	1671	I read it while I was sailing my boat to Bermuda.
1671	1672	A sailor?
1672	1675	- Good man, take a seat. - Oh, thanks.
1675	1677	You didn't happen to catch my speech
1677	1680	on the Paraguayan debt and money supply issue, did you?
1680	1682	Are you kidding me? I thought it was great.
1682	1685	Your argument for the inverse ratio
1685	1687	of capitalization to debt was genius.
1687	1691	Now, if we can just get Congress not to be so shortsighted.
1691	1695	Yes! Well put. "Shortsighted."
1695	1698	John, what do you say you and I head out to the deck
1698	1699	and light up a couple of cigars?
1699	1701	- Stogies? - Yeah.
1701	1702	Why not?
1703	1705	It's just that we lost a lot of really good men out there.
1708	1710	I'm sorry.
1710	1712	Gloria, I think I gotta go get some fresh air.
1714	1717	Thank you so much for the dance and it was wonderful to meet you.
1720	1721	I wish I were stronger.
1728	1730	Jeremy!
1732	1733	Jeremy, wait up!
1735	1737	Well, the guy wants to run for President.
1737	1739	Oh, so you're hiding, I see.
1740	1742	He thinks Moby Dick is a venereal disease.
1742	1744	Well, that's what I need. Claire...
1744	1747	Sorry to interrupt.
1747	1750	- Um, Christina wants to talk to you. - Fun's over.
1752	1754	- Yeah. - Funny.
1754	1756	- Franklin! - What a great guy.
1756	1759	You are a big hit at this wedding.
1759	1762	Well, everyone's so nice. It's easy.
1764	1767	- They're all full of shit. - What?
1767	1770	Half of these people are here because of my dad.
1770	1773	They're all just, you know, suckling at the power teat.
1773	1776	No no. Come on, they're here because
1776	1778	they want to believe they're in the presence of true love.
1779	1783	That's why people come to weddings, 'cause they wanna believe in true love.
1783	1786	What's true love?
1786	1790	True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.
1794	1797	Well, it's a little cheesy, but... I like it.
1797	1799	Uh, I saw it on a bumper sticker.
1801	1803	- So, you gonna give a toast? - Yes.
1803	1805	- Nervous? - Mm... little bit. Um...
1805	1807	What are you gonna say?
1807	1809	Would you?
1809	1811	You keep it in your cleavage.
1811	1813	Nowhere else to put it.
1813	1814	Normally, I'm not very good at these things,
1814	1817	but l-I think this one's pretty good.
1817	1819	"I never thought my sister would find someone
1819	1822	who cared about what other people thought as much as she did...
1822	1824	- until I met Craig"? - Yes!
1824	1828	That's funny! That's funny because it's true. You know, people like funny.
1828	1831	I know. But the whole funny-because-it's-true bit
1831	1833	only works if the truth is a small thing
1833	1836	like "Everyone knows Jennifer likes to shop," Ha ha ha.
1836	1838	I think you're better off going with something from the heart, honestly.
1839	1841	I think that people are gonna like this.
1841	1843	I think you're gonna hear crickets.
1843	1845	- I thing you're wrong. - Sounds of silence.
1845	1847	- Nope. - Okay, go walk the plank.
1847	1849	- Mmm-mm. I'm sticking to it. - Go ahead.
1849	1850	Hey, meet me at the back of the room.
1850	1852	I'll be the guy waiting to say "I told you so."
1856	1857	Good luck!
1857	1861	And so, after my ninth stint in rehab,
1861	1865	um, Craig... oh, Craig.
1865	1868	Craig was the only one who still believed in me.
1868	1871	Been sober now for eight months.
1873	1874	And uh...
1874	1877	I thank God every day,
1877	1880	for sending me a friend like Craig.
1880	1882	I love you, man.
1897	1899	I never thought that my sister would find someone
1899	1901	who cared about what other people thought
1901	1903	as much as she did until I met Craig.
1905	1907	Uh...
1909	1911	Um... as you all know,
1911	1914	my sister and Craig are both lawyers
1914	1916	at big law firms in New York.
1916	1919	But that's not the only thing they have in common.
1919	1922	Um, they both like the color green
1922	1926	like Craig's eyes and money.
1930	1932	Um, uh...
1943	1946	you know, someone once told me that
1946	1949	true love is
1949	1951	the soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.
1953	1956	And I think that that's a very rare thing in this world.
1958	1962	And I think it's something to be valued.
1962	1965	And I'm just really happy that my big sister's found it.
1965	1968	Uh, congratulations, Chris.
1980	1983	Ah! That was amazing!
1983	1985	It was really great.
1985	1988	We should probably head back so they're not lookin' for us.
1988	1992	I always knew my first time would be on a beach.
1992	1994	First time?
1996	1998	- You were a virgin? - Mm-hmm.
1998	2000	Wow.
2000	2003	Jeremy, we're gonna be so happy together.
2003	2005	I love you.
2005	2007	- I'm sorry? - I love you!
2017	2020	- You totally saved me. - No.
2020	2021	- Yes. - Claire, come on. Come here.
2021	2023	Mm!
2023	2025	Oh, baby, you were awesome.
2025	2027	- No. - Listen to me, awesome.
2027	2029	Okay.
2029	2031	Uh, John, this is... this is my boyfriend, Sack.
2031	2033	- Hey, fella. - How you doing?
2033	2035	- Listen, we've gotta go meet the Schreibers.
2035	2038	Okay, was great to meet you. Thank you!
2040	2042	Boom, I gotcha!
2044	2046	Oh, great! Good to see you.
2046	2048	I've been looking all over for you. I gotta get outta here pronto,
2048	2051	- I've got a Stage Five clinger. - No no, I need more time.
2051	2053	Did you hear what I just said to you?
2053	2056	Stage 5? Virgin? Clinger? Let's go, I'm gonna start the car.
2056	2057	I'm serious, let's go.
2060	2062	I don't think that you're appreciating the urgency here.
2062	2064	Not only is she a virgin, she's totally off the reservation.
2064	2066	I'm terrified of this broad.
2066	2069	- Here you are! - Hey! Gloria, wow!
2069	2071	What a coincidence, I was just singing your praises.
2071	2073	- This is John Ryan. - Oh, hi.
2073	2075	- Yeah. - So my family and a few friends,
2075	2077	we're all going back to our little place on the shore and it would be
2077	2080	- so great if you guys came. - Really?
2080	2081	- Sounds sort of wonderful. - I am...
2081	2083	well it does, it sounds... it sounds very nice.
2083	2085	But-but and I'm flattered that you would
2085	2088	even think of me to include me in something like that, Gloria. Thank you.
2088	2091	It kills me however to have to tell you I'm sorry, I just... timing's no good.
2091	2093	- I won't be able to make it. - Why?
2093	2095	- It's gonna be so much fun! - It's gonna be so much fun!
2095	2098	I'm sure it will be fun for the... for the people that are going.
2098	2100	L-I unfortunately can't go. L-I don't have, um...
2100	2102	I only have this monkey suit.
2102	2104	- I don't have any clothes. - No, we have everything you need.
2104	2107	- Problem solved. Problem solved! - The problem's not solved.
2107	2108	- The problem's not solved. - Deal us in.
2108	2110	Oh, cool cool cool! I'm gonna run and find my dad! Ah!
2110	2112	Hey, don't ask your dad! Don't ask your dad! Don't...
2113	2115	- The train's going. We gotta get on. - That's true. Why don't... why don't you
2115	2117	- just feed me to the lions? - What?
2117	2118	- Step on my head when I'm drowning. - What?
2118	2120	What a great friend. What do you mean, what?
2120	2121	John, this is completely against the rules.
2121	2123	You have a wedding and a reception to seal the deal. Period.
2123	2125	- There's no overtime. No! - Oh, no overtime?
2125	2127	What about the Chang wedding three years ago?
2127	2129	- Oh, that's bullshit. - Yeah, thought I forgot about that.
2129	2132	2:00 A.M., you dragged me 50 miles to watch you and some chick
2132	2134	play mah-jong with her grandmother at a retirement home.
2134	2136	Yeah, completely different situation.
2136	2138	- How? - What do you mean how?
2138	2140	She was a very very family-oriented girl.
2140	2142	And she was very into her grandmother. They're very family-oriented.
2142	2144	- Give me a break! - That was my first Asian!
2145	2147	- You better lock it up. - You better lock it up.
2148	2151	- No, you lock it up. Lock it up. - You lock it up. Lock it up.
2151	2154	Please! It would mean so much to me, please!
2154	2156	Look at the way he's looking at me.
2156	2158	I can tell he doesn't like me, John. He's the Secretary of the Treasury.
2158	2160	And to be honest with you, my taxes aren't exactly in line.
2160	2162	Oh, come on, you're being paranoid.
2162	2163	He's threatened by the way I dance.
2163	2166	Damn it! Why'd I have to go showin' off like that?
2166	2167	Now I'm all over his radar. Stupid!
2167	2169	You're not that good a dancer.
2169	2170	Oh, please!
2170	2172	You and I both know I'm a phenomenal dancer.
2172	2173	Now I know you're lying through your teeth!
2173	2175	You'll do anything to get me to go on this thing,
2175	2178	even if I have to walk right into the lion's den.
2178	2179	Gloria, come on!
2179	2181	You know I'm not gonna give in to this kind of behavior.
2181	2183	She's like a kid at Toys R Us. I can't be around it.
2183	2186	Oh, get off your high horse. Stop judging people.
2186	2188	You take off the white wig, and you stop judging me.
2188	2191	I don't want to be around someone who's a nut job.
2191	2193	- I need some alone time with her. - If you want to hang out with Claire,
2193	2195	the boyfriend and Cybill, by all means. I'm not going.
2195	2197	Let me lay it out for you in simple chapter and verse: You're going.
2197	2200	Let me break it down for you so you understand: I'll hold your hand like
2200	2202	- a small child. I'm not going. - Yes, you are.
2202	2204	You can go if you want. I'm... no, I'm not. No, I'm not.
2204	2206	You're gonna be a team player for once in your life.
2206	2208	- He'd love you to come. - Yes! Yes! Baba ganoush!
2208	2212	- What do I do? - Baba ganou!
2225	2228	Okay okay. Home sweet home.
2231	2233	- You okay? - Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
2233	2235	Come here, come here.
2235	2238	Are you okay? Because I'm gonna need 100% of Jeremy this weekend
2238	2240	and you're looking a little weird.
2240	2242	She took me below deck for 45 minutes. I don't have
2242	2245	- any bodily fluids left in me. - Gentlemen, everything okay?
2245	2247	- Great! Yep. - Great?
2247	2249	You know, we were thinking about a little game of touch football,
2249	2251	- you know. - Yeah?
2251	2254	- Cleary family tradition. - A little pigskin, why not?
2254	2256	- Great. - Don't forget to stretch, guys.
2256	2258	We're gonna be on the field in 10.
2287	2289	- Clothes fit. - Ooh.
2289	2293	I'm not even gonna say it, but you... you-you know I'm upset.
2293	2295	I know you are. I think you look good.
2296	2299	You know I don't look good.
2299	2301	Hey, honey!
2301	2302	I'm over here!
2302	2304	Are you ready? Are you ready for some football?
2304	2306	You want the noise brought on you? 'Cause here it comes.
2307	2309	- The what? - The noise brought on you,
2309	2310	- 'cause here it comes. - Just hike the ball, nut job.
2310	2315	Ready! Set! Hut! Hut! Hike!
2315	2317	One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.
2317	2319	Over here! Me me me me!
2321	2323	- Yes! - Ooh!
2323	2327	- Whoo! - Yes! Crab cakes and football!
2327	2328	- That's what Maryland does! - Nice one!
2330	2332	- A little out of shape? - Yeah.
2333	2335	- Way to bring it! - Way to anticipate that rush, man.
2335	2337	- No, I just saw you had it. - Hey, shut up!
2337	2339	You gotta anticipate that rush.
2339	2341	- Cool, no, of course I do. - You did a great job.
2341	2343	- What happened, Toast? - I think he's on steroids.
2343	2345	It was like trying to cover a fuckin' racehorse.
2345	2348	Get it up! Get it up!
2348	2351	Well, don't worry about it. We'll burn 'em with the post.
2351	2353	No no. No, I got a better idea.
2354	2356	Look, I want you to fake the post,
2356	2359	throw an interception to Claire, get her to feel good, you know?
2359	2361	Gets them foamy. You think you can do that?
2361	2364	John, I was first team, all-state. I can put the ball wherever I want to.
2364	2368	I'll make it rain out here. All right, guys, bring it in. Blue 17!
2368	2371	Blue 17! Red 7!
2371	2373	- Oh, you're gonna cover me? - Like white on rice.
2374	2376	All right, I like my odds here. I'm gonna give you a little warning,
2376	2378	- I'm going downtown. - Hot route!
2378	2380	Red seven, red seven, red seven!
2380	2384	Look for me in the endzone after this play, I'll be the guy holding the ball.
2384	2386	- John! Red seven! - What? I don't know
2386	2388	- what "red seven" means. - Hot route!
2388	2389	I don't... w-what is "hot route"?
2389	2393	Will you just go stand on the other side, please?
2393	2395	Are you runnin' away from me?
2395	2397	- No! I'm just gettin' over here. - You scared?
2397	2399	- Down! - Come on!
2399	2403	Ready, down, set! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
2405	2406	Go, Jeremy!
2406	2408	Hey, yo! Hit me! Hit me!
2408	2410	Boo-ya!
2410	2413	That's what we call a "Sack lunch"!
2413	2415	Num-num-num-num-num-num!
2415	2418	Ow! Bird.
2418	2420	Big tree fall hard, right?
2420	2423	How many fingers I got up? Come on, Pepe, how many fingers I got up?
2423	2425	Oh, come on, I got four. Okay, here's five.
2425	2427	Man down! We got a man down!
2427	2429	You okay?
2429	2431	Hey, is your brother okay?
2431	2432	What? Aw, he's fine.
2432	2434	I can't breathe.
2434	2436	- What's that? - I can't breathe.
2436	2438	No no no, I think he's really hurt.
2438	2440	Well, serves him right after that throw.
2440	2443	Hey! Baba ganoush!
2443	2446	I don't know... I don't know what got into me, Secretary, I just...
2446	2449	I do. Five generations of Lodge family breeding.
2451	2454	- Your father used to pull... - I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
2454	2456	- The same stunt when we were your age. - I can't breathe.
2456	2458	- Is that right? - You okay?
2458	2460	Great! You threw it perfectly!
2460	2461	Come on, get up!
2461	2464	- Don't oversell it. - I'm not selling anything.
2464	2467	Come on, stop milking it. You make us look like a bunch of pussies.
2467	2470	Jeremy! Sit this play out.
2470	2472	Todd, come on in.
2472	2474	You must be joking.
2474	2478	It wouldn't kill you to play some competitive sports
2478	2479	once in a while, would it?
2480	2481	Well, would that make you love me?
2481	2484	Pfft. Jesus.
2484	2487	Hey, Jeremy, red moon dog 7-11!
2487	2488	42, 30-teen!
2488	2490	Hut one! Hut two!
2490	2492	Blitz!
2492	2494	Jeremy!
2494	2496	Hoo-ah!
2496	2497	Oh!
2497	2499	- Oh. - That looked like it hurt.
2499	2501	- I got you! - No, you didn't!
2501	2503	- You're cheating! Oh my God. - You're cheating!
2503	2508	- The only... - Your brother, he's down again.
2509	2511	What is his deal?
2511	2513	L... I don't know what's getting into me today, guys. It's just...
2513	2517	Nature versus nurture, Lodge. Nature always wins.
2517	2519	What are you doing? It's a game of touch.
2519	2521	Every time I look over, you're on your ass again.
2521	2523	If I had any air in my lungs, I'd scream at you!
2523	2525	Oh, now you're gonna blame me?
2525	2527	'Cause you're not athletic enough to stay on your two feet?
2527	2529	I hate you.
2529	2530	Let's take a daiquiri time-out.
2530	2532	Daiquiris.
2532	2534	Oh!
2534	2537	Sweetheart, why don't you take him into the house and fix him up?
2537	2539	- Sure, Mom. - Oh, don't baby him,
2539	2543	- it just makes it worse. - Oh! My back hurts.
2543	2545	Oh, great. Game's over. Satisfied?
2545	2547	You got everyone on you now? Get all the attention.
2548	2549	Come on, baby.
2551	2554	- It's hot out here. - Yeah, it is.
2554	2557	You should have played in your underwear.
2557	2560	I'll get you a drink.
2565	2568	Oh, Jesus Christ. It burns.
2568	2570	- Oh! Poor baby. - It stings. Oh, Jesus.
2570	2571	You want me to blow on it?
2571	2573	No. No no no. No no no.
2573	2575	No, I don't need any blowing. I'm good, I'm good.
2575	2577	- I'm... thank you. - Jeremy, I'm not wearing any panties.
2577	2579	- Oh. Yeah. - That's right.
2579	2582	- Ooh, ah, oh! - Um, uh, okay. That's fun. That's nice.
2582	2584	Okay, I don't understand what's going on.
2584	2586	It's like eight hours ago you were a shy little virgin,
2586	2588	and now you're not wearing any panties. I'm just trying to...
2588	2590	- to catch up with you here. - You do that to me. Ooh.
2590	2592	- Where's my little friend? - I do what... no no no.
2592	2594	- Where's my little friend? - He's tired. He's tired.
2594	2596	- Where's my little friend? - He's in time-out, he's in time-out.
2596	2600	Gloria, please! I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted. I've had a very long day.
2600	2601	I'm just a... I had your sister's boyfriend
2601	2603	dry hump me up and down the field all afternoon.
2603	2608	My leg's cut and bleeding. I'm just... I'm not really in the mood for this.
2608	2610	Ow! Jesus Christ!
2610	2612	My father warned me about people like you, Jeremy.
2612	2614	I'm just another notch on your belt!
2614	2616	Wha... this is not like that. What are you talk... it's not like that!
2616	2618	Really?! Then what's it like, Jeremy, huh?
2618	2621	- Ow! Ow! No! Wait! Wait! - Huh?!
2621	2624	It's just that I'm feeling very strongly
2624	2625	that we're only starting to express ourselves
2625	2628	in a physical, sexual-specifically way.
2628	2629	That's it! Wait!
2630	2633	And I'd like to play some catch-up on finding out who's inside here.
2635	2637	Okay?
2637	2639	Jeremy.
2640	2643	- Jeremy, you're amazing! - Oh God, I think you're amazing.
2643	2646	- Oh my God, don't ever leave me. - Ever.
2646	2648	Good! 'Cause I'd find you.
2650	2652	Yeah.
2652	2655	Of course like all kids, I had imaginary friends, but not just one.
2655	2658	I had hundreds and hundreds and all of them from different backgrounds
2658	2661	who spoke different languages. And one of them, whose name was Caleb,
2661	2664	he spoke a magical language that only I could understand.
2668	2670	Get him all patched up?
2670	2671	I sure did, Daddy.
2672	2673	Gloria bug.
2673	2676	You go change for dinner.
2676	2678	Okay.
2682	2686	You know, she's not just another notch on the old belt.
2689	2691	I don't even wear a belt. Beltless.
2691	2694	I'm a very powerful man.
2694	2696	Yes, you are.
2699	2701	See you for dinner.
2704	2706	So, I am President of the Environment Defense League.
2706	2710	- And I pick up this little sea otter... - Oh!
2710	2712	...and... and... and... wipe off the oil from the tanker spill.
2712	2714	All right, you gotta step this up already. I'm gonna give you
2714	2716	- the damn eyedrops. - No, I don't want 'em.
2716	2718	- It's too hardcore. - Well, do you want to be alone
2718	2719	- with her or not? - Yes.
2719	2721	Put a few of these in his drink and he'll be going down on toilet seat
2722	2723	- for the next 24 hours. - I don't want to do it.
2723	2727	I can beat this guy. Let's be honorable for once.
2727	2730	And the whiskers.
2732	2734	And the oil's... the oil's flapping, he goes...
2735	2737	- Give me the eyedrops. - Thank you.
2742	2744	Perfect.
2754	2756	Let us bow our heads in prayer.
2760	2762	Heavenly Father,
2762	2767	we thank You for Thy bounty on this table
2767	2769	and ask that You bless the entire Cleary family
2769	2772	and all the friends here assembled.
2772	2774	- Amen. - Amen.
2776	2780	- Mm. Oh, these scallops look fantastic. - I, uh... I bought them from
2780	2783	an organic scallop farm right off the coast of, uh, Nattachoke.
2783	2787	Actually, Sack got the Governor to subsidize part of the project.
2787	2790	And now it's the state's only self-sustaining scallop farm.
2790	2793	Say that five times, fast. You can't do it. Self-sustaining...
2795	2796	They actually look terrific. Maybe I'll actually try some
2796	2798	when I get the sensation back in my face.
2798	2801	- From the, uh... football game. - Again, Jeremy, I'm sorry.
2801	2804	I just, you know, I have this damn competitive streak.
2804	2806	Um... I'm seeing a Buddhist about it.
2806	2809	Not just any Buddhist. His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. He's a good friend.
2809	2812	Stop traffic. Because when I go back to town,
2812	2814	I'm actually gonna see an orthopedist
2814	2816	about what you did to my back. And not just any orthopedist,
2816	2818	I'm gonna see a Dr. Epstein who specializes in...
2818	2821	Hey, Sack, how long have you and Claire been seeing each other?
2821	2823	Claire and I? Um, what's it been, sweetheart? A couple years?
2823	2826	Three and a half.
2826	2828	Yeah, um, actually, we started dating while we were doing
2828	2831	- Habitat for Humanity. - Sure.
2831	2833	Pretty soon... we'll be getting married.
2833	2835	Yep.
2835	2838	Well, not too soon, um...
2838	2841	We still have a lot of things that we want to accomplish.
2841	2844	Anyway, once Claire and Sack tie the knot,
2844	2847	two of the great American families, the Clearys and the Lodges,
2847	2849	- will finally unite. - Hear, hear.
2849	2851	And then of course, you can challenge the Klingons
2851	2853	for interstellar domination, right?
2856	2858	Jeremy...
2859	2861	I saw you on the dance floor.
2863	2866	You move pretty good.
2866	2868	Oh. Thanks a lot.
2868	2870	L... really just got lucky.
2870	2872	I was more in the zone than anything else.
2872	2874	It was the booze dancing.
2876	2877	Sorry guys, I forgot.
2877	2879	How are you guys connected to the family again?
2879	2882	Uncle Ned's kids.
2882	2883	You know... Uncle Ned?
2884	2887	Aunt Liz's brother. Ned and Liz.
2888	2890	Hmm. No, I don't know.
2890	2891	So, Jeremy,
2891	2893	you and your brother are venture capitalists.
2893	2896	- That's right. - That's great.
2896	2899	Venture capitalist. The backbone of the system.
2899	2901	- It's the new pioneer. - New pioneer.
2901	2903	So is it just about the money?
2903	2906	No no, it's about,
2906	2909	investing in companies that are ethically and morally defensible.
2909	2912	Well, like what? Give me an example.
2912	2915	Like what? Well, there's the company that we have where we're taking the...
2915	2918	the fur or the wool from sheep
2918	2922	and we turn it into thread for homeless people to sew.
2922	2923	And then they make it into cloth,
2923	2925	which they in turn sew
2925	2927	then, um...
2927	2930	make some shirts and pants
2930	2933	for other homeless people to sell. It's a pretty good deal.
2933	2936	- People... people helping people. - Yeah.
2936	2938	That's... that's very admirable.
2938	2940	Thank you. Although, don't make me out to be a saint just yet.
2940	2942	We do turn a small profit.
2942	2944	After all, someone has to pay for the, uh,
2944	2947	lap dances for the big guy here.
2947	2949	Oh!
2949	2951	He's joking around. It feels so good when he jokes.
2951	2953	What's this, uh, company called?
2953	2956	- Holy sh... - Shirts & Pants. Holy Shirts & Pants.
2956	2958	It's a little corny and obvious,
2958	2961	but what do you get out of being subtle, right?
2961	2963	Well, that's a hell of a good project.
2963	2965	I'm gonna mention something to the Commerce Secretary.
2965	2967	That would be terrific. That would be great, huh?
2967	2969	Terrific, it was terrific.
2969	2972	Isn't my Willy doing a wonderful job there in Washington?
2972	2976	- Mommy. - You know, Willy's father, my husband
2976	2979	was the Secretary of State
2979	2981	for President Franklin Roosevelt.
2981	2984	That must have been so thrilling... FDR.
2984	2987	My gosh, FDR was a wonderful President.
2987	2989	He was a doll.
2989	2991	The wife, though, Eleanor...
2991	2994	- big dyke! - Oh Lord.
2994	2996	Huge dyke! A real rug muncher!
2996	3000	Looked like a big lesbian mule.
3002	3005	Grandma, you can't talk like that, okay? It's not right.
3006	3008	Somebody... somebody get me another Scotch for Christ sakes!
3008	3009	I think I'm gonna go to bed.
3009	3011	Honey, are you okay?
3012	3014	Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You know, I'm just a little tired. Thanks.
3014	3016	- Okay. - You all right?
3016	3018	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
3020	3023	What an athlete. A tremendous competitor.
3023	3025	I know.
3025	3028	Todd, I noticed that you haven't even touched your food yet.
3028	3031	- I don't eat meat or fish. - He's a homo.
3032	3035	Mommy, let's not go there again.
3035	3039	Actually, um, Todd is an amazing painter.
3039	3042	He's going to the Rhode Island School of Design.
3042	3043	Oh, that's a great school. Congratulations, Todd.
3043	3045	That's really impressive, "Rizdee."
3045	3049	Yeah, Dad... Dad used to think I'd be a political liability,
3049	3051	you know, in case he ever ran for President.
3051	3054	Now, Todd! Actually, truth be told,
3054	3057	polling shows a majority of the American people
3057	3061	would ultimately empathize with our situation.
3061	3064	- What is our situation, Dad?! - You're a homo.
3064	3068	Oh, for God sakes, William, put Mommy to bed already.
3068	3070	Okay. Mommy, we've had a long day.
3070	3073	I can do it myself, asshole.
3076	3078	Wow.
3078	3080	I'll be in my room painting.
3080	3082	Homo things.
3083	3085	You just go right ahead, Toddy.
3085	3089	- Mmm, wonderful scallops. - Absolutely. Wonderful.
3089	3091	You know, um...
3091	3093	I think I'm gonna get some air.
3093	3096	Oh, I'll get some air if you want some company.
3096	3099	- Sure. - Let me just change my shoes.
3099	3101	- Excuse me. - All right. I'm gonna... can't walk away
3101	3103	from the delicious food that we got here.
3112	3114	I just had my tits done.
3115	3117	You like 'em?
3118	3121	Those... seem like lovely tits.
3121	3124	William doesn't give a shit about my tits.
3124	3126	Well, darn him.
3126	3129	But Mrs. Cleary, this is pretty sudden.
3129	3132	You've been playing cat and mouse with me ever since you came here.
3132	3134	- Mrs. Cleary, I don't... - Call me Cat.
3135	3137	Okay, Cat...
3137	3139	Call me Kitty Cat.
3139	3142	Okay, Kitty Cat,
3142	3146	this feels borderline inappropriate, and...
3146	3148	- Feel them. - What?
3148	3149	- I said feel them. - Mrs. Cleary...
3149	3151	Kitty Cat.
3151	3154	I'm sorry, Kitty Cat. Are you out of your fucking mind?
3154	3157	I'm not letting you out of this room
3157	3159	until you feel them.
3170	3173	Wow, they feel really nice. Real orb-like.
3173	3175	It's amazing what they can do to...
3177	3179	Pervert.
3185	3188	- John, I need to talk to you. - No, not right now.
3188	3191	What's wrong with you? Why you got the weird look all over your face?
3191	3193	Claire's mom just made me grab her hooters.
3193	3195	Well, snap out of it! What? A hot, older woman
3195	3198	made you feel her cans? Stop crying like a little girl.
3198	3200	I wasn't crying like a little girl.
3200	3202	Why don't you try getting jacked off under the table in front
3202	3206	of the whole damn family and have some real problems? Jackass.
3206	3208	What were they like, anyway? They look pretty good. Are they real?
3208	3212	Are they built for speed or for comfort? What you do with 'em? Motorboat?
3212	3214	You play the motorboat? Ppppt!
3215	3218	You motorboatin' son of a bitch. You old sailor, you!
3218	3219	Where is she? She still in the house?
3219	3221	What is wrong with you?
3221	3223	What do you mean what's wrong with... what's wrong with you?
3223	3225	- No, what's wrong with you? - No, what's wrong with you?
3225	3226	- You're projecting. - Drop it.
3226	3228	You drop it! You stop projecting on me.
3228	3230	Why don't you go enjoy yourself while I go ice my balls and spit up blood?
3230	3233	- Drop it! - "Team player."
3244	3247	Hey! Good thing I didn't hold my breath.
3247	3249	Yeah, I'm sorry, I just, uh...
3249	3252	Sorry I'm late, I just...
3252	3254	You okay?
3254	3256	No no, I'm fine, I just...
3256	3258	I just got, uh, held up.
3258	3261	Hmm. My family's a little strange.
3261	3263	A little strange?
3263	3266	Come on. Claire.
3266	3269	Your family... are totally nuts.
3269	3272	- And guess what? - What?
3272	3274	- I love it. - You do?
3274	3276	- Yeah, it seems great. - Really?
3276	3278	- Yes! - I get a little self-conscious.
3278	3280	It's a family! You're mixing it up.
3280	3284	You got the sweet little grandma who's really sweet
3284	3287	with her, like, little, like, white hair, but then she's kinda mean.
3287	3289	But you're like, "Well, fuck it, she's so old,
3289	3291	and she's not gonna change now."
3291	3293	- Oh. - Shit, it was great!
3293	3296	I just hope I didn't embarrass myself with that stupid joke I told.
3296	3299	Are you kidding? That was so funny!
3299	3301	- No, really? Really? - Yeah! Yeah, you're like that
3301	3304	crazy guest who thinks he's part of the family already, it's great.
3304	3306	Doesn't sound that great. That sounds horrible.
3306	3308	- No, it's cute. - The crazy guest who thinks he's
3308	3311	like a part of the family who's gonna say inappropriate stuff? What is that?
3311	3314	- Yeah. You know, you break the ice. - Yeah.
3314	3316	It can be so stuffy sometimes in there.
3316	3318	Claire?
3318	3320	- Yeah? - There you are.
3320	3322	Have you checked on Sack? I think he's pretty sick.
3322	3324	- Oh, really? - Yeah.
3324	3327	Okay. Yeah. No, I'll be right in.
3327	3329	Um, I should... I should go check on him.
3329	3333	Yeah, sure, okay. Yeah, we'll take a walk some other time.
3334	3337	- Claire. - Mm-hmm?
3340	3342	I'Il... I'll talk to you later.
3342	3343	Okay.
3355	3357	Oh no.
3357	3358	Are you okay?
3358	3362	Well, Claire, um...
3362	3363	my head's buried in a toilet.
3363	3365	What do you think? Why don't you do the math, okay?
3367	3370	Honey, it's okay to be vulnerable sometimes. It's just me.
3370	3374	Yeah, you can just cut that psychobabble bullshit that your mom tells you, okay?
3374	3376	- Right. - Hey, you wanna help me out?
3376	3379	Do ya? Do ya, kid? Why don't you go get me a 7-Up, okay?
3379	3381	All right, 'cause I think I'm...
3381	3383	I think I might get vulnerable again.
3396	3399	What the f... fuck is going on?
3399	3402	Shh, shh, shh! You'll wake my dad.
3402	3404	Baby, I started thinking about what you said before
3404	3408	and I think the problem is I am not being adventurous enough for you!
3408	3411	Gloria, I am pretty sure that is not what I've been saying to you.
3411	3414	Shh! Baby...
3414	3419	I'm gonna make all your fantasies come true.
3419	3422	But the... my fant...
3423	3426	I love you.
3454	3457	# Till I drive you away #
3459	3462	# I know what you'll say #
3462	3466	# You say oh #
3467	3470	# Someone you know #
3474	3477	# But I promise you this #
3479	3485	# I'll always look out for you #
3487	3490	# Yeah, that's what I'll do #
3493	3498	# I say oh #
3498	3500	# Oh-oh #
3503	3507	# I say oh #
3507	3511	# Oh-oh-oh #
3512	3514	# I saw sparks #
3516	3520	# Yeah, I saw sparks #
3522	3525	# I saw sparks #
3527	3530	# Yeah, I saw sparks #
3531	3534	# I saw them #
3534	3537	# La la la. #
3541	3544	Gloria, go to sleep, honey.
3544	3546	It's not Gloria.
3546	3548	Jesus Christ!
3548	3550	We had a moment at the dinner table, didn't we?
3550	3552	No. No, we did not have a moment at the dinner table.
3552	3554	Yes! We had a moment.
3554	3556	I was right there. Todd, I would have noticed if there was a moment.
3556	3559	- There was no moment. - I made you a painting.
3559	3561	What?
3561	3563	I call the painting "Celebration."
3563	3566	It's sexual and violent.
3566	3569	I thought you might like it.
3570	3571	No.
3573	3575	Where's that coming from? You hear that?
3575	3578	- Hide! You gotta hide! Yes. - No. They need to know about us.
3578	3580	- It's okay. - No no no no. Hide hide hide!
3580	3581	Please please please.
3581	3583	You gotta hide, you gotta hide! Not there. Not there!
3583	3586	I'm not comfortable... I'm not comfortable with that!
3586	3588	- Let's play tummy sticks! - What's tummy sticks?
3588	3590	I don't want to play tummy sticks! Get in the closet.
3590	3592	It's okay, I was where you were a year ago.
3592	3595	Get in the fucking closet right now! You go get in the closet!
3595	3597	You go get in the closet! You go get in the closet!
3597	3599	You go get in the closet! You go get in the closet! Go!
3601	3604	I'll pop out at the right moment.
3605	3607	No, you will not!
3611	3615	Everything okay in here? I thought I heard something.
3615	3618	I was just having a bad dream.
3618	3620	Oh.
3621	3624	I know about bad dreams.
3624	3627	You know, Todd...
3627	3630	screams
3630	3632	at night sometimes.
3633	3636	You know, the doctors call it night terrors.
3636	3638	I don't know.
3647	3649	Hmm?
3656	3659	Oh. Okay, then.
3659	3662	Sleep well.
3666	3671	There's nothing terrifying about the night.
3671	3675	Now, listen, if you let me go to bed and get some sleep
3675	3676	then l... we can talk tomorrow.
3676	3678	You won't make time for me.
3678	3679	If I get my sleep I'll have to... I'Il...
3679	3681	I'll love to make time and talk about, uh, uh, different things.
3681	3683	Like paintings.
3685	3687	Can't wait for tomorrow
3687	3689	when I got energy and I can really share some stuff.
3689	3691	Okay.
3691	3693	- Oh, it's gonna be great. - You sleep.
3699	3701	Mmm. Okay. That was nice.
3701	3704	That was nice! Please let me just sleep.
3705	3709	I can't take this fuckin' shit anymore!
3717	3720	There he is! It's the big guy! Get in here.
3720	3722	Wait till you see the spread. Anything you want.
3722	3724	Yeah, well, get what you want to go.
3724	3726	The ferry leaves in 25 minutes. We gotta get outta here.
3726	3729	Whoa, what's your problem? Have some of this stuff.
3729	3731	I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, John. I'm fried.
3731	3734	- Soft mattress? - Yeah, that could've been it.
3734	3736	It could have been the soft mattress. Or, it could've been
3736	3738	the midnight rape... or the nude, gay art show that took place in my room...
3738	3740	one of those probably added to the lack of sleep...
3740	3742	Try one of these scones, you're gonna love 'em.
3742	3745	I'm a little traumatized to have a scone. Let's move.
3745	3748	Will you slow down for a second? The whole eyedrop thing backfired.
3748	3752	Okay? It didn't work. She had to leave me and go attend to him.
3752	3754	Why are you looking at me like that?
3754	3756	You're falling for this broad.
3756	3758	No! I just met her.
3758	3760	Exactly. I'm gonna go.
3760	3762	- You can't go. - Watch me.
3762	3764	Watch me take this on down the road.
3764	3767	If you leave, Gloria is gonna freak out and throw a shit fit,
3767	3770	and it's gonna go into crisis lockdown mode here at the house.
3770	3772	I don't give a baker's fuck!
3772	3775	I just had my own sock duct-taped into my mouth last night!
3775	3778	- Whoa, what? - Yeah, the sock
3778	3779	that I wore around all day,
3780	3781	playin' football in, pouring sweat in,
3781	3784	was shoved into my mouth, and there was duct tape over it!
3784	3786	Well, let's talk about it. I'm a good listener.
3786	3788	I'm not in a place to discuss what happened. Okay?
3788	3790	I felt like Jodie Foster in "The Accused" last night.
3790	3793	I'm gonna go home, see Dr. Finkelstein
3793	3796	and I'm gonna tell him... we got a whole new bag of issues,
3796	3799	we can forget about Mom for a while. I'm gonna go.
3799	3801	Suit yourself.
3801	3802	Rule #1.
3802	3806	Rule #1: Never leave a fellow crasher behind.
3809	3812	- I can't believe how selfish you are. - I need you.
3816	3818	A friend in need is a pest.
3822	3824	I'll stick it out with you because you're desperate.
3824	3826	- I need the big guy. - I'm gonna try to give you
3826	3828	a little bit more time, because somebody can't close.
3828	3830	- Fair enough. - But if you want my help,
3830	3834	you gotta listen. Number one: Stop being a pussy.
3834	3835	Number two: Make a move.
3835	3837	Number three...
3837	3838	you know it.
3838	3841	Could you pop the syrup for me? Just as a top off?
3841	3843	Here's what's gonna happen, Tonto.
3843	3845	Kimosabe's gonna have some flavor,
3845	3848	- I'm gonna choose not to eat with you. - We're not gonna eat together?
3848	3850	No. I like to recharge my batteries,
3850	3853	and shut down the engines, and get myself back to neutral.
3853	3855	When the meal's over with, I will talk to you.
3855	3857	I don't want to get into what happened last night,
3857	3859	'cause it's only gonna make me mad. Let's get through today,
3859	3861	let's keep our eye on the prize, let's focus,
3861	3862	- and let's close some ass. - Noted.
3868	3871	Can I tell you something without you getting angry?
3872	3874	I love you.
3876	3878	Yeah, you, big guy.
3879	3881	I love you too.
3883	3885	Hello.
3885	3888	- Trapster, it's Sack. - Sackmaster!
3888	3891	- How was the wedding? - Oh, it was boring, you know,
3891	3893	but the bachelor party, of course, rocked.
3893	3895	We got Heidi a couple of those fucking sluts
3895	3896	from the environmental group, remember them?
3896	3899	No way! Did you tap that again?
3899	3901	Once at my place, then once back in the cab.
3901	3904	Damn! Sluts!
3904	3906	Oh, how's Claire?
3906	3908	Still trying to figure out what she's doing with her life?
3908	3911	Claire? She's, you know, whatever, I don't know.
3911	3913	She's saving the world one maladjusted kid at a time.
3913	3915	But that'll all change when we're married,
3915	3918	'cause I want a wife. I don't want a fucking martyr, right?
3918	3920	I hear that, my friend.
3920	3923	Hey, man, listen, l-l-l-I got...
3923	3925	do you remember that private detective we used
3925	3926	to set up that fucking Shearson Lehman prick?
3926	3929	The big sleazy, Tommy Gufano. He's a wop genius.
3929	3932	Yes. I need you to get some dirt on these two guys
3933	3935	John and Jeremy Ryan. They're brothers from New Hampshire.
3935	3938	They got some sort of N.P.O. Called "Holy Shirts & Pants."
3938	3941	- I will check into them. - Excellent, bro.
3941	3942	- You da man! - Take it easy.
3948	3950	Where's Sack?
3950	3952	Oh, he's... he's still not feeling very well.
3952	3955	Well then, we'll sail without him.
3981	3983	- John my boy. - Yes?
3983	3985	We're tacking back round.
3985	3987	Do me a favor, ease the sheets,
3987	3989	swing the jib starboard.
3989	3991	Okay, let me...
3994	3997	Okay.
4006	4008	One minute.
4008	4010	- Hi. How's it going? - Hi.
4010	4012	Oh, just swinging the jib here for your dad.
4012	4015	Starboard. Trying to get it over here and crease the sheet.
4015	4018	Um, but starboard's this way.
4018	4022	- Oh, that's right. What am l... - Yeah.
4022	4023	- What am I thinking? - I'll help.
4023	4025	- Okay. - Hang on, hang on.
4025	4027	- Watch the jib boom. - Oh.
4031	4034	All right, push it. Push it this way.
4034	4036	Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is better.
4036	4039	- Come on, use some muscle. - There we go.
4039	4041	All right, that's beautiful. Done. Done.
4041	4044	You know, I'm used to sailing down under with the Kiwis,
4044	4046	so everything is backwards.
4046	4048	Even the toilets... when you flush them,
4048	4051	the water spins the opposite way.
4051	4053	Really freaks you out the first time you see it.
4068	4070	John my boy,
4070	4072	come on up here.
4072	4074	Man "The Woodwind" for a while.
4074	4076	On my way.
4080	4083	Hey, your dad was telling me about a great beach near here
4083	4085	that maybe we could check out
4085	4087	if you have any interest when we get back.
4087	4090	Yeah.
4090	4092	Great. Okay, it can get confusing up here.
4092	4093	If you have a problem, just give me a call.
4093	4095	Thank you.
4095	4098	Ah, sailin'! What have we got, Captain?
4098	4100	Take the wheel.
4122	4124	Thanks.
4124	4126	Now how would one get to this Sook's Bend?
4126	4128	Actually, it would be a really nice bike ride.
4129	4131	Everything's ready for the quail hunt!
4131	4133	For the quail hunt?
4133	4136	Yeah. It's a... it's a Cleary family tradition.
4136	4138	Well, I think you might have to deal me out on this,
4138	4140	- 'cause we were gonna... - Nonsense, I insist.
4141	4143	John, you gotta go! You're gonna love it! You're gonna love it!
4143	4146	Sack, honey, um, you're a little bit sick for hunting.
4146	4148	Oh, no, I'm great! Honey, I'm great!
4148	4151	Oh, I'm going! Right? Right?
4154	4156	Okay. You're going.
4156	4159	- So, I guess I'll see you later. - See you later.
4159	4161	Just take it easy, okay?
4161	4163	- Okay. - Okay.
4163	4165	Mr. Environmental is also a-a hunter.
4165	4167	It's kind of an interesting combination.
4167	4169	I hunt quail, Jeremy!
4169	4171	They're overpopulated in this region and they're decimating
4171	4173	the grub worm population. You got a fucking problem with that?!
4173	4176	Not nearly as much as I do with the, uh, attire that you have on,
4176	4179	or just your general point of view towards everybody.
4179	4180	But let's go kill some birds. I'm psyched.
4184	4186	Have you even shot one of these things before?
4186	4188	The whole 17 years we've known each other,
4188	4190	I've been sneaking off to go on little hunting trips around the world.
4190	4193	No, I don't even know what the fuck a quail is!
4193	4196	I feel totally ridiculous. Like why do I have to be in camouflage?
4196	4198	So the big bad quail doesn't see me?
4198	4200	I know. It's like, why can't we hunt something cool
4200	4203	like a hawk, or an eagle, or something with some talons?
4203	4206	That'd be awesome. You mean, something like big game even like a gorilla...
4206	4207	Yeah. Gorilla!
4207	4208	- Or rhinoceros... - Rhino!
4208	4211	Or a fucking human being? That'll get you jacked up.
4211	4213	That's a little heavy.
4213	4215	I mean, like... you're hunting a human being right now,
4215	4217	the most dangerous game.
4217	4220	Like a worthy adversary. Not a human being that's armed...
4220	4223	- Oh, if he wasn't armed. ...but a clever... a clever human being
4223	4225	- who knows the jungle, or the woods. - Or like a bad guy.
4235	4237	There's something not right about these guys.
4237	4239	What do you mean?
4239	4242	- I mean, it's time to send them home. - Sack, don't do anything crazy.
4242	4243	Just relax, I'm just gonna scare them a little bit.
4244	4246	All right.
4246	4248	To the right!
4250	4252	Argh!
4252	4254	- Oo-ooh! - Ooh.
4256	4258	- They got me! - Oh, shit.
4258	4260	- They got me! - Oh, shit.
4262	4264	Ow! Jesus!
4264	4267	- You okay, buddy? - Oh, don't "okay, buddy" me.
4267	4270	Look, we just came by to say we're gonna take a little bike ride
4270	4272	and then we're gonna come back and check up on you.
4272	4274	And take care of him, okay? I want you to get my little angel up and running.
4274	4277	- Hang in there. - I hope you flip your bike over
4277	4279	and knock your two front teeth out, you selfish son of a bitch!
4279	4281	You leave me in the trenches taking grenades, John!
4283	4285	# Ch-ch-ch-uh, ch-ch-ch-uh #
4285	4288	# Ch-ch-ch-uh, ch-ch-ch-uh #
4288	4290	# In the summertime when the weather is hot #
4290	4293	# You can stretch right up and touch the sky #
4293	4296	# When the weather's fine you got women #
4296	4299	# You got women on your mind #
4299	4301	- Wait wait wait wait. - # Have a drink, have a drive #
4301	4304	# Go out and see what you can find #
4304	4306	# We're no threat, people #
4306	4308	# We're not dirty, we're not mean #
4308	4311	# We love everybody, but we do as we please, when the weather's fine #
4312	4313	- # We go fishing or go sailing... # - Yes!
4313	4316	- # In the sea... # - Whoa!
4316	4318	- # We're always happy... # - Come on!
4318	4320	# Life's for livin', yeah, that's our philosophy... #
4320	4322	- Slow down! - # Dah, dah-dah, dah, dah... #
4323	4325	Tough luck, Ralphie boy...
4326	4328	- Randolph. - Shh.
4328	4330	I'm watching my stories, man.
4330	4332	Is that what you get paid to do?
4332	4336	It's exactly what I get paid to do.
4336	4337	Look, I want to know where Claire is.
4337	4340	She took a bike ride down to the beach.
4340	4342	With who?
4342	4344	With that fellow from the wedding
4344	4347	that everyone seems to be so fond of.
4352	4355	So you're a venture capitalist?
4355	4357	What does that mean?
4357	4359	Oh, it's really not that interesting, actually.
4360	4362	You don't sound very enthused.
4362	4364	Oh, no, it's just...
4364	4366	you know, things started happening
4366	4368	and you go down a road and you think
4368	4370	it's just for a little while.
4370	4372	And then you get caught up in it
4372	4375	and you're kind of into it
4375	4377	and just don't even have time
4377	4380	to really ask questions about it. And before you know it
4380	4383	you're living a life that you didn't set out to, or that you intended to.
4384	4386	Do you know what I mean?
4386	4389	Yes, I do.
4390	4392	I think that there's some great things
4392	4394	that I'd like to do,
4394	4396	that-that maybe I'm capable of, hopefully.
4396	4398	Oh, yeah? Like what?
4398	4400	I don't know.
4400	4402	We'll see. I'm still young.
4404	4407	Well...
4407	4409	you're not that young.
4411	4414	I'm sorry.
4414	4416	Give me your hands.
4416	4418	I know this game. Okay.
4418	4421	I'm not gonna bite you.
4422	4424	Do you want it full speed or half speed?
4424	4426	Full.
4428	4430	You're never gonna hit me, I don't think.
4430	4431	I'm pretty quick.
4433	4435	What?
4435	4437	- Let me get settled before you go. - You didn't approve of that?
4437	4438	No, because you're supposed to...
4440	4442	You gotta wait until I put them back!
4442	4444	Come on!
4445	4448	So what about you... with Sack?
4448	4450	Is that a good thing?
4450	4453	Yes, I think it's a... good thing.
4455	4456	You don't sound very enthused.
4456	4458	I am.
4458	4461	L... well, I mean, I think I am, l...
4462	4464	I'm...
4465	4467	Okay.
4467	4469	I g... you know, we've just been
4469	4471	talking so much about the future lately
4471	4476	and, uh... I mean, I always assumed that we would get married.
4476	4477	But, uh...
4480	4482	I'm scared.
4482	4483	I am.
4485	4486	But I think that that's how everyone feels
4486	4488	before they're about to get married. I mean,
4489	4491	don't you think?
4491	4493	Yeah, no. Don't answer that.
4493	4496	That's my rationalization and I'm sticking to it.
4496	4498	Fair enough.
4498	4501	And I don't mean to pry.
4501	4502	Yes you do.
4508	4511	Well, however it works out, I hope you...
4512	4514	uh, I hope you realize
4514	4517	that you deserve somebody great.
4550	4552	I have an announcement.
4555	4558	I know that we said we were gonna wait, but, uh,
4558	4560	given the spirit of this weekend
4560	4562	well...
4562	4564	Claire, come on.
4564	4567	Come on. Come on come on, it's okay.
4567	4568	Come on! Come on.
4577	4578	Claire and I are getting married.
4580	4584	Good, Sack. That's wonderful!
4585	4587	- Wonderful. - Wonderful!
4589	4591	Way to go, man! Way to go!
4591	4592	Claire bear, you never told me!
4592	4595	Two of the great American families.
4595	4597	- Claire, you took us all by surprise! - Yeah.
4597	4600	- Yeah. - You're good! You're good!
4600	4602	Can-can you just give me one minute?
4603	4604	- Yeah! - Okay.
4604	4606	Great.
4606	4608	Congratulations, young man!
4608	4610	- Welcome to the family! - This is wonderful!
4610	4613	Look, kid, I'm sorry. You win some, you lose some, right?
4613	4614	- Let's go home. - No, I'm not...
4614	4616	- I can't... I can't do that. - What are you talking about?
4616	4618	Look, l-I think I'm in love with her.
4618	4621	Yeah, l-l-I think... I think that you're nuts.
4621	4623	That's what I think.
4623	4625	I'm gonna tell her the truth.
4625	4628	Jesus Christ!
4631	4633	- Hey. - Hey!
4633	4636	How are you!
4636	4638	Okay, listen, Gloria, you know that I think
4638	4641	that you're an amazing person, a really amazing person,
4641	4643	but I feel like I have to be upfront with you.
4643	4646	L-l-I really don't see this relationship going further than this weekend.
4646	4648	But I love you!
4648	4650	Yeah, I think you'll learn as time goes on
4650	4652	that there's a difference
4652	4654	between infatuation and love, you know?
4654	4657	Obviously, you're gonna have strong feelings for me
4657	4658	because you lost your virginity to me,
4658	4660	- but that doesn't mean... - Oh, I wasn't a virgin.
4663	4665	- What? - I wasn't a virgin.
4665	4668	Far from it.
4668	4671	I just thought that that's what guys wanted to hear.
4673	4676	Come on.
4676	4678	Jeremy!
4680	4682	Wow!
4686	4688	Hello, son.
4688	4691	- You okay? - Not now, Father, please.
4691	4693	No offense to you,
4693	4695	I think we might be on different wavelengths.
4695	4697	I think you'd just be spinning your wheels with me,
4697	4699	but, uh, have a little of the sacrament here.
4699	4702	No one likes to drink alone. We'll set you up.
4702	4704	There you go, get your hands on it. Take it while it's hot.
4704	4708	Take it while it's hot. I'm gonna pour till it's on the tray. Here it is.
4709	4712	Happy days. Here's looking up your address.
4722	4724	She's good.
4724	4726	I mean, I believed that she was a virgin.
4726	4728	It hurts to be lied to like that.
4728	4730	It's a horrible feeling to feel that way.
4730	4732	But I, you know, was looking to take advantage of something, too.
4733	4735	So could I really feel that bad?
4735	4737	It's not like I was who I was. You know what I'm saying? So, fair play.
4737	4739	And let's be honest with each other here, okay?
4739	4742	Let's put all the cards on the table. She's fit for a straitjacket.
4742	4744	This broad's fucked three ways towards the weekend.
4744	4747	And you wanna know what? I dig it! It turns me on!
4747	4748	Yeah! It turns me on!
4748	4750	Because you wanna know what the kicker is, Father?
4750	4752	Maybe I'm a little fucking crazy!
4752	4754	That's right! Maybe Jeremy's a little nuts.
4754	4756	Maybe there's something about me that I'm a little cuckoo.
4756	4758	I know it's a surprise. I know it's not on the surface.
4758	4761	I mean, I had an imaginary friend when I was a kid. His name was Shilo!
4761	4763	We used to play checkers with each other every day,
4763	4765	and bless his heart, Shilo'd always let me win!
4768	4770	And that ain't normal! There's something odd in that,
4770	4771	but maybe that's what it takes to make you feel
4771	4773	like you're connected with somebody. I don't know!
4773	4775	But I know when that redhead starts getting kooky
4775	4778	that something about me feels alive inside!
4778	4780	I'm diggin' talkin' with ya. You're a really enlightened cat
4780	4783	and I like that about ya. I think you're a special special man.
4784	4786	Okay, come in for the real thing.
4786	4788	- Mmm? Mmm? - Get in here for the real thing.
4788	4790	I love ya. You're a sweet man.
4790	4792	Oh, dear God.
4806	4808	You can't marry this guy.
4808	4810	Why?
4811	4813	Because I've fallen for you.
4819	4820	Wonderful.
4821	4823	Oh, good news travels fast.
4823	4825	Excuse me.
4825	4827	Sorry, thanks. Thanks.
4828	4830	Trapster, talk to me.
4832	4833	No shit.
4838	4839	And do you maybe feel the same way?
4840	4841	Maybe.
4841	4844	Maybe. That's all I needed to know.
4844	4847	But this is crazy, because I don't know any...
4847	4849	- Why? - I don't know anything about you!
4849	4852	- What do you mean? - You do investments in New Hampshire
4852	4855	and you have a crazy brother...
4855	4857	Well, actually, I need to talk to you about that. It's not a big deal,
4857	4859	but maybe you want to sit back on the swing.
4860	4862	Run!
4862	4865	Johnny! She's trying to kill me!
4865	4867	- Grandma! - Whoa whoa!
4867	4869	- Get the gun from her! - Put the gun down!
4869	4871	- Mother, stop! - This is the real world, lady!
4871	4874	You can't just go shooting people on a whim!
4874	4875	Why does grandma have a gun?
4875	4878	- What did you do? - I told you that in confidence!
4880	4883	- That was a confession! - What are you talking about?
4883	4885	Why don't you tell her, John?
4885	4889	- I don't know what's going on. - You don't know?
4889	4891	- I'm playing catch up, too. - I don't...
4891	4893	- Sack, what are you doing?! - Remembering yet?
4893	4895	- You remember yet? - Are you okay?
4895	4897	They're not who they say they are, Claire.
4897	4899	- Those aren't even their real names. - What?!
4899	4901	No, everything he told you is a lie.
4901	4902	L-I don't understand what you're saying.
4902	4904	Claire, they crash weddings.
4904	4906	They crash weddings so that they can sleep with girls.
4906	4909	Everything that they have told us is a complete fabrication.
4909	4911	No, you're joking.
4911	4913	All of it is a lie. Don't you fucking get up.
4913	4915	- Sack, will you just stop?! - Okay okay.
4915	4917	Is that true?
4917	4918	No, well, no, it's... not entirely.
4918	4921	No, it's a yes or no question.
4921	4923	I know, but it's complicated.
4923	4924	Yes or no?
4929	4931	Yes or no?
4931	4933	Yes...
4935	4938	- with shades of grey. - Oh.
4939	4941	I'm not perfect,
4941	4944	but who are we kidding? Neither are you.
4945	4947	And you wanna know what? I dig it!
4947	4949	Jeremy tried to seduce me!
4950	4953	You did?
4953	4954	I want my painting back.
4954	4956	The painting was a gift, Todd.
4956	4958	I'm taking it with me.
4960	4962	You had me going, son.
4962	4963	I thought it was something special.
4963	4966	There's a ferry leaving in 10 minutes.
4966	4968	I suggest you be on it.
4970	4972	Come on, let's go.
4974	4975	I want you.
4975	4977	I love you.
4979	4981	He made a fool out of you, Claire.
4985	4987	Come on, let's go.
4990	4992	Sweetheart.
5029	5032	Now bunch those panties up into a little ball.
5033	5035	Put that little ball right in your mouth.
5035	5037	- Oh, that's good. - Hang up the phone.
5037	5040	Okay, and I will definitely call you back later then.
5040	5043	- Come on, wrap it up. - Talk to you soon. Thank you, Larry.
5043	5044	What the fuck? You can't knock anymore?
5044	5047	- I know how I can get to her. - What?
5047	5049	I know how I can get to Claire.
5049	5051	Oh, John, you gotta drop this thing.
5051	5053	I'm... I can't do this anymore with you, okay?
5053	5056	It's been several months, and you haven't heard anything from her.
5056	5057	She hasn't returned your phone calls,
5057	5059	she's never responded to one of your letters,
5059	5061	- she didn't respond to the candygram. - Right.
5061	5063	God knows what happened to the little kitten that you got her.
5063	5066	Because she didn't keep it and I know you're not raising that goddamn thing.
5066	5068	- Okay. - I think it's very obvious
5068	5071	at this juncture that she just flat out does not wanna see you.
5071	5074	I disagree. Now look, they're having the engagement party
5074	5077	for her tonight at the Burke's club. We're going at 7:30.
5077	5079	I'm not g... John, I can't...
5080	5082	Okay okay, listen to me, Tasmanian devil.
5082	5085	- Listen to me. I can't go. - Why?
5085	5087	'Cause I can't go, because I have a schedule. Because I have...
5089	5091	What is your deal? What is your problem?
5091	5093	For the past couple of months you've been a ghost.
5093	5096	I can't find you anyplace, and now I come to you with an idea,
5096	5099	I put myself on the line, you shoot it down with your negativity.
5099	5101	Your goddamn negativity! I don't need it! I'm an idea man.
5101	5105	I thrive on enthusiasm. Don't take the wind out of my sails. I need you.
5105	5107	Buddy, you know I love you,
5107	5109	and I hate to see you like this,
5109	5111	but we gotta look at reality here.
5111	5113	There's gonna be Secret Service at this thing. They have pictures of us.
5113	5116	There's not a shot in hell we can get into this thing.
5116	5118	You're so cautious. I'm more of a risk taker.
5118	5121	I'm two steps ahead of you and 10 steps ahead of Secret Service.
5121	5124	Oh, yeah. 46 extra long, baba ganoush special.
5126	5127	We're waiters!
5127	5130	Buddy, for your own good, you gotta let this thing go.
5130	5132	Now, I'm gonna meet you there at 7:30, okay?
5133	5135	Okay.
5148	5150	- Hey, how do I look? - Good, man.
5150	5151	- Good. - Where's your friend?
5151	5153	Late, as usual. Is Claire...
5153	5155	- Oh, she's looking fine! - Okay.
5177	5179	Next thing you know they pick me up,
5179	5181	put me on the top of this mountain
5181	5183	and they start chanting, and I realized
5183	5187	they thought I was God!
5187	5189	And I'll tell you something, I thought I was too.
5189	5191	Claire.
5191	5193	Let's dance.
5218	5220	- Huh? - You!
5223	5225	Let's go, sport.
5227	5230	Whoa, hold it.
5230	5232	Sack!
5235	5237	Okay, Sackmaster,
5237	5239	one more. We should get back to the bar.
5239	5241	You're right.
5244	5247	You get near my fiancée again,
5247	5248	I'll kill ya.
5250	5252	Let me say one thing.
5252	5253	Oh!
5256	5259	Did you check out the rack on that bartender?
5259	5262	Hey, you're the Sack. She'll come to you.
5262	5263	Oh my God, yeah, she will. You're right.
5285	5286	Jeremy!
5286	5289	# Everyone who's anyone was there... #
5289	5292	- God damn it. - # They all had something to share #
5292	5294	# About so-and-so and on and on #
5294	5297	# I'm in the corner speechless... #
5299	5301	Perfect.
5303	5306	Johnny, wait a second.
5306	5308	Come on, John!
5308	5309	Oh, what time is it?
5310	5312	John, will you wait a second so I can talk to you?
5312	5314	Hold on, man.
5314	5316	Will you stop? Stop... I'm not gonna chase you
5316	5318	down the whole fucking street, man.
5318	5320	Hold on a second. Let me talk to you for a second here.
5320	5322	About what? About how you left me high and dry
5322	5324	- to get my ass kicked by Sack again? - Sack did that to you?
5324	5326	And how long have you been sneaking around with Gloria
5326	5328	- behind my back? - I wanted to tell you about Gloria.
5328	5330	I tried to. I didn't know how.
5330	5332	And I'm sorry that you had to find out this way.
5332	5334	I'll level with you.
5334	5336	I care about her a lot.
5337	5339	I love her.
5339	5341	What?!
5342	5344	You're unbelievable! Judas!
5346	5348	Rule #5. You're an idiot.
5348	5350	You're wrong to pull out the rulebook on this.
5350	5352	There was never any rules about this. What's the rule
5352	5354	about walking away? Never walk away on a crasher in a funny jacket.
5354	5357	Rule #115.
5357	5359	You're an asshole.
5361	5364	# I'm awake #
5364	5367	# You're still sleeping #
5369	5371	# The sun will rise #
5371	5373	# Like yesterday #
5376	5378	# Everything #
5378	5381	# That we are now #
5382	5385	# Is everything #
5385	5388	# We can't let go #
5388	5391	# It's gone forever... #
5393	5395	This is John.
5395	5397	Whatever.
5397	5399	Hey, John, it's Jeremy.
5399	5402	Uh, just calling to see what you're up to, uh...
5402	5405	would love to hear back from you, man.
5405	5408	Play sharp.
5408	5410	And we'll do the wedding in peaches and apricots.
5410	5412	Even though it's a June wedding, should the weather turn nasty,
5412	5414	warm colors will really help you.
5417	5421	# Don't you go away tomorrow... #
5421	5423	Johnny.
5425	5427	Johnny, open up, man.
5427	5430	Does anyone ever feel like they're just...
5430	5431	disappearing?
5431	5435	I feel so much like giving up.
5440	5441	Yeah!
5445	5446	Get it?!
5447	5448	Put your hands out like this.
5448	5450	- Claire. - Please.
5453	5455	Hi. Thanks for coming.
5457	5460	- Hey! - Get off her, man! What are you doing?
5460	5463	You're supposed to move your hands.
5463	5465	You're not getting enough attention?
5467	5469	Love doesn't exist!
5469	5470	That's what I'm trying to tell you guys.
5470	5472	And I'm not picking on love,
5472	5474	'cause I don't think friendship exists either.
5478	5480	Hey! Yeah!
5480	5483	Get down! Put your hands up!
5486	5488	Are you okay? Get up, buddy.
5488	5491	Move it on.
5492	5495	Gloria, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately,
5495	5497	and l-I think that I'm ready
5497	5500	to take, um, this relationship,
5500	5501	our relationship to the next level.
5502	5503	To what the next level of the... of the...
5503	5505	of the relationship would be.
5505	5507	- Jeremy! - Is that good?
5508	5509	I'm so ready to take it to the next level too.
5510	5511	Do you want to watch me with a girl?
5511	5514	What about those Brazilian twins we met at the ballgame?
5516	5518	L-I was... I was... I was thinking
5518	5520	more along the lines of an... of an... of an engagement.
5521	5523	But that sounds terrific. That sounds... that sounds unbelievable.
5523	5525	The Brazilian girls were very nice. They seemed like...
5525	5528	Oh, Jeremy, I do!
5528	5530	- I love you. - I love you.
5530	5533	L-I can't believe that they're getting married.
5533	5535	I mean don't you-you think that's really soon?
5535	5537	Well, you know Gloria. She's impetuous.
5539	5540	Has to have what she wants when she wants it.
5541	5543	Well, we had to give her a Sweet 16
5543	5546	on her 13th birthday. You remember that.
5546	5548	Yeah, I remember, but this is...
5548	5550	Dad, this is marriage!
5550	5552	When you know what you want, you know what you want.
5556	5557	So...
5557	5559	which of these do you like?
5563	5565	Um...
5565	5568	well, I could... I could go with the tall tapered arrangement
5568	5572	with, uh, tulips and freesias and orchids,
5572	5574	or I could go with a votive
5574	5576	of roses and lilies, I don't know.
5577	5581	- Claire bear. - Yeah?
5581	5583	What's wrong?
5587	5589	Look...
5593	5595	we have no way of knowing
5595	5598	what lays ahead for us in the future.
5598	5601	All we can do is
5601	5603	use the information at hand
5603	5605	to make the best decision possible.
5608	5610	It's gonna be fine.
5610	5613	- Your whole life is gonna be fine. - Yeah.
5623	5626	Happy birthday.
5626	5628	Can't let a little pissing and moaning break tradition.
5628	5631	Oh right, that's today.
5637	5640	I see you've been getting into a little light reading.
5640	5642	That's not mine. I bought that for a friend.
5642	5644	Yeah.
5644	5645	So how have you been?
5645	5647	- Great. Really spectacular. - Good.
5647	5649	- What have you been up to? - Eh, you know,
5649	5651	this and that. Crashing weddings.
5651	5654	- Alone? - No, not alone.
5654	5656	Well, who have you been crashing with then?
5656	5657	Chazz.
5657	5659	- Chazz? - Chazz.
5659	5661	- John, you don't even know Chazz... - Yes, I do.
5661	5664	He's a great guy. We've been having a ball together.
5664	5667	All right, look, I wanted to come by here
5667	5669	and tell you that I feel really bad
5669	5671	about everything that's happened between us.
5671	5673	Your friendship means a lot to me.
5674	5675	I miss seeing you.
5677	5679	I know, l...
5679	5681	look, I'm... I'm happy for you.
5681	5683	I'm glad you found someone.
5683	5685	I can't tell you how glad it makes me
5685	5687	to hear you say that, man.
5687	5689	Get on in here, let the big bear
5689	5692	get his paws on you. You know I love you.
5692	5694	- It's good to see you. - Good to see you.
5694	5696	Are you sure you've been... this does not look like a guy
5696	5698	- who's been okay. - Oh, I know.
5698	5701	- It's like a pigsty. - It's like a mosh pit in here.
5701	5702	Listen, I'm getting married.
5702	5704	- Get out. - What?
5704	5706	You just sat there and said that you were happy for me, that I'm...
5706	5709	I'm hanging by a thread. I'm reading don't-kill-myself books.
5709	5712	- You said that the book wasn't yours. - Don't worry about the book.
5712	5715	It isn't mine, but I glanced at it.
5716	5718	John, you've been my friend
5718	5720	for 16 years. I'm getting married.
5720	5722	I need you there to be my best man.
5722	5724	Kindly leave!
5724	5727	- I'm try... - Kindly leave.
5734	5736	Would mean a lot to me if you came.
5736	5738	Oh, I bet it would, hillbilly.
5738	5740	What?!
5740	5742	- White trash! - What are you talking about?
5742	5744	Out! Out!
5744	5747	You better get your ass to that wedding.
5758	5761	- Yeah? - Hi, is Chazz here?
5762	5765	Chazz, there's someone here to see you!
5766	5768	Pick up your fucking skateboard!
5789	5791	Chazz?
5794	5796	What the fuck do you want?
5796	5798	I'm John Beckwith.
5798	5800	I'm friends with Jeremy Grey.
5800	5803	God damn it, why didn't you say so?
5803	5805	Come here, brother! Give me a hug.
5805	5807	Bring it in for the real thing!
5810	5812	Have a seat. Yeah.
5814	5816	God damn you!
5816	5818	I almost numbchucked you, you don't even realize.
5818	5820	Ouch!
5820	5822	- Yeah. - Hmm.
5822	5825	- Is this your place? - No. No no no no no.
5825	5827	- No, I live with my Ma. - Oh.
5827	5829	Yeah. You hungry?
5829	5831	Hey, Ma! Can we get some meatloaf?
5831	5833	Chazz, I think I'm okay. I had a bite
5833	5835	- right before I came over. Thank you. - You sure?
5835	5838	- So, how's my protegé? - Jeremy, boy, he...
5838	5840	Yeah, J-bone.
5840	5842	J-bone is... believe it or not, he's getting married.
5842	5844	What?!
5847	5849	What an idiot!
5849	5852	Oh, what a loser!
5852	5855	Good good! More for me and you.
5855	5857	More for... more for...
5861	5862	I gotta go.
5862	5864	Hey, babe, yeah.
5864	5866	You do whatever you have to do.
5877	5879	- Thanks. - Okay, be strong.
5882	5885	I'm just living the dream!
5888	5890	That's unbelievable.
5890	5892	Oh, man, I feel like, "Wow!"
5893	5895	It's like I come over, I don't know what to expect.
5895	5897	I gotta be honest, I come in, it's like,
5897	5899	a little like I'm trying to get my bearings.
5899	5901	There's cartoons, your mom, and it's like, you still got it!
5901	5903	Look at her!
5903	5906	"Just living the dream," I love that!
5906	5908	You know what? I will have some meatloaf. Let's have some meatloaf.
5908	5909	- You want some? - Yes!
5910	5911	I knew you'd come... Hey, Mom!
5911	5913	The meatloaf!
5913	5916	We want it now! The meatloaf!
5918	5921	What is she doing? I never know what she's doing back there.
5921	5924	"Just living the dream." Where did you get that girl?
5924	5925	- She's hot! - I got her yesterday.
5925	5927	- Yesterday? - Yeah.
5927	5929	I rode my bike over to a cemetery nearby.
5930	5932	Her boyfriend just died.
5934	5936	- You met her at a funeral? - Yeah.
5936	5938	The dude died in a hang-gliding accident.
5938	5940	What an idiot!
5941	5943	"Oh, I'm hang gliding!
5943	5945	Honey, take a good picture... I'm dead!"
5947	5950	What a freak!
5950	5953	You met her at a funeral.
5953	5955	Yeah, I'll throw in a wedding every now and then,
5955	5957	but funerals are insane!
5957	5960	The chicks are so horny, it's not even fair.
5960	5962	It's like fishing with dynamite.
5962	5965	- Horny? - Yeah, crazy horny.
5965	5968	I just... at a funeral?!
5968	5970	Grief is nature's
5970	5972	most powerful aphrodisiac.
5972	5974	- Huh. - Look it up.
5974	5977	- I didn't know that. - That's what I've learned.
5978	5981	Ma, the meatloaf! Fuck!
5982	5984	Saturday... I got one Saturday.
5984	5985	You're coming with!
5985	5988	Chazz, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't...
5988	5991	I'm not judging you, 'cause I think you're an innovator, but...
5992	5994	there's no way I'm ready for that.
5996	5998	A time to plant,
5998	6000	and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
6000	6002	A time to kill and a time to heal;
6002	6006	A time to break down and a time to build up;
6006	6008	A time to weep
6008	6010	and a time to laugh;
6014	6017	- A time to cast away stones... - So senseless.
6017	6019	Damn you, Roger.
6021	6022	Roger!
6025	6027	Oh!
6027	6029	Damn you, Roger!
6029	6031	Damn it! Damn you!
6031	6033	I'm in pain.
6033	6036	I'll try to fight it. Try to fight it.
6036	6039	I don't know about you people, but I'm in pain.
6039	6041	I know that there is no good in them
6041	6043	for man to rejoice and to do good in his life...
6045	6047	for that which befalleth
6047	6049	the sons of men, befalleth beasts.
6050	6053	Even one thing befalleth,
6053	6056	as the one dieth, so dieth the other.
6056	6059	Yea, they all have one breath,
6059	6062	so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast.
6063	6066	While each man thinks he knows love,
6066	6069	love, we have learned, is a mystery.
6069	6072	That's what makes today
6072	6075	so special.
6075	6078	We witness two people choosing to marry
6078	6082	ones they truly love.
6089	6090	Whoa whoa, hey!
6090	6092	Hey hey!
6093	6095	He's the best man.
6097	6099	Yeah.
6099	6101	Thank you.
6117	6118	I don't believe this.
6129	6130	Hat in hand.
6130	6132	I'm sorry I'm late.
6132	6134	I'm glad you're here.
6134	6137	And-and I'm sorry I called you white trash.
6137	6140	- I didn't... - John, apology accepted.
6140	6142	And I'm sorry I called you a hillbilly,
6142	6143	I don't even know what that meant.
6143	6146	John, it's okay.
6146	6147	Do you mind if I get married now?
6148	6149	No, go ahead.
6150	6152	Hi, Todd.
6154	6156	Although we may choose whom we marry,
6156	6158	- we don't always choose... - Psst.
6158	6161	Claire, I'm not here to bother you,
6162	6164	I just came to be his best man. Don't worry about me.
6164	6165	Pretend I'm not here.
6165	6167	Okay.
6167	6170	I'm not a nut.
6171	6174	You look really pretty, by the way.
6174	6176	That's all I'm gonna say.
6177	6179	I can't stop thinking about you.
6180	6182	It's all I think about and I don't know what to do.
6182	6183	- Ahem. - I'm sorry.
6185	6188	You see, love is mysterious...
6188	6190	God, I miss you.
6192	6194	Okay, excuse me, I'm sorry.
6196	6198	Claire, hold on a second. Claire, Claire!
6198	6200	Claire, will you wait just a second?
6201	6202	All I wanted was a second alone
6202	6205	so I could try to explain things.
6205	6207	But I've never gotten that chance.
6208	6210	Maybe I don't deserve it.
6210	6212	So here goes.
6212	6214	For longer than I care to remember,
6214	6217	my business has been crashing weddings.
6217	6219	I crashed weddings to meet girls.
6219	6221	Business was good.
6221	6223	I met a lot of girls.
6223	6227	And it was childish, it was juvenile...
6227	6228	And pathetic.
6228	6230	Yeah, that's probably
6230	6232	the best word to describe it.
6232	6235	But you know what? It also led me to you.
6235	6238	So it's hard for me to completely regret it.
6238	6240	And that person that you met back at your folks' place...
6240	6242	that was really me.
6242	6244	Maybe not my name...
6244	6246	I'm John Beckwith by the way... or my job,
6246	6248	but the feelings we felt
6248	6251	the jokes, the stupid laughs...
6251	6252	that was all me.
6253	6255	I've changed. I've realized something.
6255	6258	I crashed a funeral earlier, and l...
6260	6262	Oh, Jesus.
6262	6264	It wasn't my idea.
6264	6265	I was basically dragged to it.
6265	6269	I went with Chazz, who you forgot to tell me is totally insane.
6269	6271	He also might be a genius
6271	6274	because it actually does work. He's cleaning up.
6274	6276	- John. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6276	6278	That's neither here nor there.
6278	6281	And I see this widow and she's a wreck.
6281	6284	She's just lost the person she loves the most in this world.
6284	6286	And I realized
6286	6288	we're all gonna lose the people we love.
6288	6291	That's the way it is.
6291	6293	But not me,
6293	6295	not right now.
6295	6297	Because the person I love the most is standing right here,
6297	6300	and I'm not ready to lose you yet.
6300	6305	Claire, I'm not standing here asking you to marry me.
6305	6307	I'm just asking you...
6307	6309	not to marry him.
6310	6312	And maybe take a walk.
6312	6314	Take a chance.
6314	6316	Wow!
6316	6318	Wow!
6319	6320	This congregation really doesn't care
6320	6323	about how depressing your life is, John, okay?
6323	6325	Claire, baby, could you just... could you go back up on the altar
6325	6327	so we can have a wedding?
6329	6331	I'm sorry.
6331	6333	I am.
6333	6334	What?
6335	6337	I can't marry you.
6342	6343	Secretary...
6343	6346	your daughter's a little...
6348	6351	Sack, I've always liked you...
6352	6354	so I put up with your stories
6354	6356	about scallops and otters,
6356	6358	and it's all good
6358	6360	because you seemed to make her happy
6360	6362	and that's what matters to me most.
6362	6365	But this is her decision.
6365	6368	Huh.
6368	6370	I stand by my daughter.
6370	6372	You don't know shit.
6372	6374	- Claire, go back up on the altar. - No.
6374	6377	Claire! Claire, get up on that altar right now.
6377	6379	- Stop it. - Claire, get your fucking ass
6379	6382	- on that altar right now! - Wow, getting a nice preview
6382	6384	or what marriage is gonna be like with Ike Turner here.
6386	6388	- Sack! - Oh God, here it goes.
6391	6394	Share that with the Dalai Lama, jackass.
6395	6398	- I think I had him. - I know you did.
6398	6400	Just go kiss the broad.
6410	6413	Would it be a total cliché if I kissed you right now?
6414	6416	Yes.
6424	6426	Just wonderful.
6427	6430	So damn beautiful!
6432	6434	With every death there comes rebirth.
6434	6437	It's the circle of life.
6437	6438	We're gonna be all right.
6439	6441	Hey.
6441	6443	Uh-uh-uh.
6448	6450	Hey.
6450	6453	Uh-uh!
6455	6457	- So, what's next? - I'm starving.
6457	6459	Fujimora wedding, 3:00 P.M.
6459	6461	Hey hey.
6461	6463	I'm just throwing it out. I'm just saying, just...
6464	6467	They would have great tempura.
6467	6469	We don't even have a back story, I just...
6469	6472	- No, forget it, forget it. - I'm talking out loud.
6473	6474	We're a folk-singing group
6475	6477	- from Salt Lake City! - Yeah!
6478	6480	Yes we are.
6482	6487	# In the morning don't say you love me #
6488	6493	# 'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door #
6493	6495	# Stay with me... #
6507	6509	# Measure me in metered lines #
6509	6512	# And one decisive stare #
6512	6513	# The time it takes #
6514	6517	# To get from here to there #
6517	6519	# My ribs that show through t-shirts #
6519	6522	# And these shoes I got for free #
6522	6525	# I'm unconsoled #
6525	6527	# I'm Ionely #
6527	6529	# I am so much better #
6529	6532	# Than I used to be #
6532	6535	# And I'm leaning #
6536	6538	# On this broken fence #
6538	6543	# Between past and present tense #
6544	6546	# And I'm losing #
6546	6549	# All those stupid games #
6549	6551	# That I swore #
6551	6554	# I'd never play #
6554	6559	# But it almost feels okay #
6569	6572	# Circumnavigate this body #
6574	6576	# Of wonder #
6576	6578	# And uncertainty #
6580	6584	# Armed with every precious failure #
6585	6589	# And amateur cartography #
6591	6593	# I'm breathing deep before #
6593	6595	# I spread those maps out #
6595	6598	# On my bedroom floor #
6598	6600	# And I'm leaning #
6601	6603	# On this broken fence #
6603	6608	# Between past and present tense #
6609	6611	# And I'm losing #
6611	6614	# All those stupid games #
6614	6616	# That I swore #
6616	6619	# I'd never play #
6619	6622	# But it feels okay #
6622	6624	# And I'm leaving #
6624	6627	# With goodbye #
6627	6630	# And I'm losing #
6630	6633	# But I'll try #
6633	6635	# With the last ways left #
6635	6638	# To remember sing #
6638	6643	# My imperfect offering. #
6658	6661	# Sailing on this boat away tonight #
6661	6664	# Thinking I might drown if the waves aren't right #
6664	6667	# Wind pushing me from side to side #
6667	6669	# And I'm thinking #
6669	6671	# Of what I had #
6673	6675	# And my sweetheart #
6678	6682	# And my sweetheart #
6683	6687	# And if I never see you #
6687	6690	# Again #
6690	6692	# I just want you to know #
6692	6694	# What I think #
6696	6699	# Sunday took me out for a walk in the park #
6699	6702	# And as the dark ran round, the track lights lit up #
6702	6705	# People running round in their shorts in the rain #
6705	6707	# Again #
6707	6709	# And again #
6709	6714	# Thinking that you're my sweetheart #
6716	6720	# You're my sweetheart #
6723	6727	# I can hardly see the road #
6727	6730	# But I'm gonna try #
6730	6735	# Yeah, I'm gonna try #
6736	6739	# 'Cause you're my sweetheart #
6742	6747	# You're my sweetheart #
6748	6751	# And if I never see you #
6751	6753	# Again #
6753	6756	# I just want you to know #
6756	6758	# What I think #
6759	6763	# If you've got to run #
6763	6765	# Yeah, I'll be there #
6765	6768	# If you've got to run. #
6775	6778	# Now Kiri waits it out #
6778	6781	# But she's only young enough for some things #
6781	6784	# Healing the sick and dumb #
6784	6787	# And low on the radar, the smoking gun #
6787	6790	# We're moving fast enough to function #
6790	6793	# Fast enough to function #
6793	6795	# Maybe it's me #
6795	6799	# 'Cause I seem to think in twos and threes #
6799	6802	# You find your open door #
6802	6805	# And through the skids I sail #
6805	6807	# And keep that love #
6807	6809	# Underground #
6809	6811	# Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #
6811	6813	# Ooh-ooh-ooh #
6813	6815	# Ooh-ooh #
6815	6817	# Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #
6817	6819	# Ooh-ooh-ooh #
6819	6821	# Ooh-ooh #
6821	6823	# Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #
6823	6825	# Ooh-ooh-ooh #
6825	6827	# Ooh-ooh #
6827	6829	# Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh #
6829	6831	# Ooh-ooh-ooh #
6831	6833	# Ooh-ooh. #
