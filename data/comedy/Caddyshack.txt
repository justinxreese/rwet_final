83	86	All right, kids! Rise and shine! Let's go, everybody!
90	92	Come on, girls! Enough with the hair!
112	114	Turn off that radio!
127	129	I talked to Pete Scalary last night.
129	133	He's going to get that training bra back to you real soon. Who's in here?
135	137	Danny saw me naked!
137	139	You think you're cool!
139	141	-Who are you? What's your name? -Dennis.
141	142	Did you brush your teeth?
142	143	Both of them.
143	145	When will you get a haircut?
145	146	Who is this?
147	148	That's your nephew!
148	150	What are we running, a restaurant?
151	152	Did you get out yesterday?
153	154	Twice.
154	157	I caddied for Ty Webb in the morning and I had doubles in the afternoon.
158	159	How much is that?
159	161	It's about $30 plus tips.
162	164	Put it in the college fund!
164	165	He's like a three-year old!
165	168	You must tell him every time he gets some money.
168	169	When you get back from Little League...
169	171	...let's do some painting on this house.
171	174	The Douglases got fake brick. You don't have to paint it.
174	177	Hooray for the Douglases! Oh, Jonathan! Bad boy!
178	181	Why not give the St. Copius Scholarship people a call?
181	184	I don't know about that place. I talked to a guy who went there.
184	187	He said there were only two girls and they were both nuns.
187	189	I saw that! That's about $1 0 in change!
190	192	I had a couple of burgers and some Cokes for lunch.
192	193	How many Cokes?
193	194	Four or five.
194	196	What are you, a diabetic?
196	199	You're not leaving until we settle the college thing!
199	202	If he doesn't have something lined up by September...
202	205	...l'll ask Tom Burdick to put him on at the lumber yard!
205	207	He won't work at the lumber yard!
207	210	He isn't going to be a caddy all his life, is he?
210	212	"l'm alright No¨body worry a¨bout me
215	219	"Why you got to give me a fight? Can't youjust let it ¨be?
233	234	"Who do you want?
235	238	"Who are you going to ¨be today?"
292	294	Hey, Mr. Webb. Can I ask you something?
294	296	Sure thing. Shoot, Timmy.
296	297	Danny.
298	300	When you were my age, did you ever have trouble...
300	303	...deciding what you wanted to do with your life?
304	307	No, I've never had that problem. Why?
308	311	Forget it. I didn't think you'd understand.
312	314	-Do you take drugs? -Every day.
314	317	-Good. So what's the problem? -I don't know.
317	320	Did you take the Cooter Preference Test...
320	322	...when you were a senior in high school?
322	325	Yes, I took it. They said I should be a fire-watcher.
327	330	-What are you supposed to be? -An underachiever.
331	333	I've got to go to college. I've got to!
333	335	Danny, this isn't Russia.
335	337	Is this Russia? This isn't Russia, is it?
337	341	I didn't think so. No, the thing is, do you want to go to college?
342	345	In Nebraska? Besides, it costs like $8,000 a year.
346	348	Hold on. I think I lent you $2.50 yesterday.
348	350	I can't pay for everything, so don't ask for money.
351	352	My dad can't afford it.
352	354	I haven't told him about the scholarship I didn't get.
355	357	I'll be working in a lumber yard for the rest of my life.
357	359	What's wrong with lumber? I own two lumber yards.
359	361	I notice you don't spend much time there.
361	363	I'm not sure where they are.
370	371	I like you, Betty.
371	373	That's Danny, sir.
373	376	Danny. I'm going to give you a little advice.
376	378	There's a force in the universe...
378	380	...that makes things happen.
381	384	All you have to do is get in touch with it.
386	388	Stop thinking. Let things happen...
389	391	...and be...the ball.
397	399	Where's the wedge?
403	404	Find your center.
405	407	Hear nothing. Feel nothing.
414	416	That was kind of incredible, sir.
416	418	-You try it, Danny. -Pardon me?
422	423	You try it.
429	431	Just relax. Find your center.
432	435	Picture the shot. Picture it.
435	437	Turn off all the sound.
439	441	Just let it happen. Be the ball.
442	445	Be the ball, Danny. You're not being the ball, Danny.
446	448	It's difficult with you talking like that.
448	450	I'm not talking. Stop talking.
452	454	I'm not talking now.
454	456	Be the ball.
462	464	Where did it go?
464	468	Right in the lumber yard. It's okay. We'll work on it.
497	499	Do you know what I just saw?
499	500	A gopher!
501	502	A gopher? Where?
502	505	Do you know what gophers can do to a golf course?
506	509	I think they're tunneling in from that construction site over yonder.
510	511	Czervik Construction Company?
511	515	I'll slap an injunction on them so fast it will make their heads spin!
515	517	You get rid of those gophers...
517	520	...or I'll be looking for a new greenskeeper! ls that clear?
520	522	Aye, sir! Very clear, sir!
523	525	I'll put my best man on it!
529	533	I'm looking at you. You wore green so you could hide.
535	538	I don't blame you. You're a tramp. That was a good one!
539	541	That was right where you wanted it.
541	543	You're a little monkey woman, you know that?
543	546	You're a little monkey woman. You're lean...
546	549	...and you're mean and you're not too far between either...
549	550	...l bet, are you?
550	553	Would you like to wrap your spikes around my head?
554	556	Damn your eyes, man!
556	560	I told you to cut the long grass on the 13th and mow the practice green!
560	562	I was unavoidably detained.
564	567	You can forget about the 13th and the practice green.
567	569	I've got a more important job for you.
569	572	I want you to kill every gopher on the course!
573	576	Check me if I'm wrong, but if I kill all the golfers...
576	577	...they'll lock me up and throw away the key.
578	581	Gophers! Not golfers! The little brown furry rodents!
583	584	We can do that.
584	586	We don't even need a reason.
586	587	Then do it, man!
588	590	I'll just do the same thing, but with gophers.
594	597	It's not my fault nobody can understand what you're saying.
604	607	Give me the Mets on three and I'll take the Yankees even.
608	609	I'll call you back.
612	613	Caddyshack.
620	622	All right. I'll be right up.
624	625	Take over for me.
625	626	I'll be right back.
635	639	So I jump ship in Hong Kong and make my way over to Tibet...
640	643	...and I get on as a looper at a course in the Himalayas.
643	644	A looper?
645	648	A looper. You know, a caddy, a looper...
648	649	...a jock.
649	653	So I tell them I'm a pro jock and who do you think they give me?
654	656	The Dalai Lama, himself.
657	659	The 1 2th son of the Lama.
659	662	With flowing robes, grace, bald, striking.
664	667	I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver.
667	671	He hauls off and whacks one. Big hitter, the Lama. Long!
672	676	Into a 1 0,000 foot crevice right at the base of this glacier!
676	678	Do you know what the Lama says?
681	683	"Gunga galunga. Gunga gunga da gunga."
686	689	So we finish 1 8 and he's going to stiff me.
689	691	And I say, "Hey, Lama!
692	695	"How about a little something, you know, for the effort?"
695	698	And he says, "There won't be any money...
698	701	"...but when you die, on your deathbed...
702	705	"...you will receive total consciousness."
708	711	So I've got that going for me... which is nice.
713	716	Your ball is right over there. Go straight and you can't miss it.
716	719	Mrs. Havercamp, you go that way and it's right over....
720	722	Mrs. Havercamp, you need this.
722	724	I might, at that.
731	734	Mr. Havercamp, your ball is right over here, sir.
744	747	No, Mr. Havercamp, the green is over there. It's that way.
747	750	Sir, just bend a little that way and swing away and...
751	754	...just straight up. That's fine. Great.
764	765	That's a peach, hon!
769	770	I'm hot today!
775	777	Did they die on you, Tony?
782	784	I can't pay you. Lou has to.
784	785	Where is he?
785	786	He's out.
786	788	I can see he's out, numb nuts!
790	791	Give me a Coke.
797	799	Wait a minute! That's only 50 cents!
801	804	Lou raised the price of Coke. He's been losing at the track.
805	807	Well, I ain't paying no 50 cents for no Coke!
809	812	Then you ain't getting no Coke!
815	817	You've had it, Noonan! Come on, open this door!
819	820	Watch it, jerk!
824	825	Come on out, Noonan!
827	828	What's going on?
828	830	Open up. Come on.
833	835	Sure you don't need me for nothing?
843	847	I think you and I ought to go outside and have a little talk.
848	852	My friend, you have no idea how happy this is going to make me.
852	854	I'm going to enjoy this thoroughly.
854	856	I hope that means both of us.
856	858	Couldn't we just arm wrestle or something?
858	860	That's my brother! Give me a hand.
862	864	Whip his ass, Tony!
864	867	Now, who did you say the jerk was, jerk?
880	882	What is this?
884	886	What does the sign say?
886	887	"No bare feet."
887	888	What does that sign say?
888	889	"No fighting."
889	890	What does it mean?
890	891	No fighting.
891	895	You owe me one gumball machine! What's that candy wrapper doing there?
896	897	Don't you see it?
897	899	Well, pick it up!
900	901	I'll put it right on the line.
901	904	There have been a lot of complaints already:
905	907	Fooling around on the course, bad language...
907	910	...smoking grass, poor caddying.
910	912	If you guys want to get fired...
913	916	...if you want to be replaced by golf carts, just keep it up.
917	918	One announcement.
918	923	Carl Lipbaum died last week in summer school from a severe anxiety attack.
923	925	I heard he swallowed his vomit during a test.
925	929	However it happened, he was a good caddy and a good kid.
929	931	He was a brownnose, Lou! You hated him.
931	935	Shut up! That means the caddy scholarship is available again.
936	939	Anyone who's interested should go see Judge Smails.
939	941	And kiss his ass!
941	942	That would help.
943	945	Let's move out. We've got golfers waiting.
945	947	You! Pick up that blood.
951	955	What kind of grades do I need for this Caddy Scholarship deal?
955	957	If you've been a good caddy, I think they're lenient.
957	959	We're about to tee off now...
959	960	...so call the hospital...
960	964	...and move my appointment with Mrs. Bellows back 30 minutes.
967	969	Just snake a tube down her nose and I'll be there...
969	972	...in four or five hours. Testing now.
980	981	Don't you have homes?
985	988	There's a brown Audi parked in my parking space.
988	991	Get a tow truck over here and have it hauled away immediately!
999	1001	Look at the wax build-up on those shoes!
1001	1004	This is fine leather! I want that wax stripped off!
1004	1007	I want them creamed and buffed with a fine chamois.
1007	1008	I want them now!
1008	1010	You've got them, Judge!
1010	1012	Get dressed. You're playing golf today.
1012	1015	No, I'm not, Grandpa! I'm playing tennis!
1015	1017	You'll play golf and you'll like it!
1017	1018	What about my asthma?
1018	1019	I'll give you asthma!
1021	1022	What did you shoot today?
1022	1024	I don't keep score, Judge.
1024	1026	How do you measure yourself with other golfers?
1026	1027	By height.
1028	1031	You should play with Dr. Beeper and myself.
1032	1035	I mean, he's been Club champion for three years running...
1035	1037	...and I'm no slouch, myself.
1037	1041	Don't sell yourself short, Judge. You're a tremendous slouch.
1046	1047	Have you heard the latest one...
1047	1051	...about the Jew, the Catholic and the colored boy who went to heaven?
1054	1056	That's a doozie, Judge!
1056	1057	Colored boy?
1057	1060	You son of a bitch! I'll fix you!
1075	1078	Here you are, kid. Park my car, get my bags...
1079	1081	...and put on some weight, will you?
1082	1086	Hey, Wang! What's with the pictures? It's a parking lot! Come on.
1086	1090	I think this place is restricted, so don't tell them you're Jewish.
1090	1091	I'm AI Czervik.
1091	1095	I'm playing with Drew Scott today and this is my guest, Mr. Wang.
1096	1098	Give me half a dozen of the Vulcan D-tens...
1098	1101	...and set my friend up with the whole schmear.
1101	1103	You know, clubs, bags, shoes...
1103	1104	...gloves, shirt, pants.
1105	1106	Orange balls! I'll have a box of those...
1106	1109	...and give me a box of those naked-lady tees.
1111	1113	This is the worst-looking hat I ever saw!
1113	1117	You buy a hat like this, I'll bet you get a free bowl of soup.
1118	1121	It looks good on you, though.
1126	1130	Judge Smails, Smails the Third, Dr. Beeper and Bishop Pickering.
1130	1131	Who wants it?
1131	1134	I'll take Smails if nobody wants him.
1134	1135	Brownnose!
1139	1141	Motormouth, take Dr. Beeper.
1141	1143	John, you take the Bish.
1145	1147	This is ridiculous. Let me carry that.
1147	1148	No. I can do it.
1151	1153	-You sure? -Yeah.
1180	1181	Madonna with meatballs!
1189	1190	Turds!
1190	1193	How many times have I spoken to you about your language?
1193	1195	Sorry, Grandpa, I forgot.
1198	1201	Bishop Pickering, Dr. Beeper, this is my niece, Lacey Underall.
1201	1204	Lacey's mother sent her to us for the summer.
1204	1207	It must be a nice change from dreary, old Manhattan.
1207	1211	Yes. I was getting really tired of having fun all the time.
1214	1215	Double turds!
1216	1218	So where do we tee off?
1220	1224	We're all set to go. You know my friend here, don't you?
1226	1228	Are we waiting for these guys?
1228	1230	Hey, Whitey! Where's your hat?
1248	1249	Let's go while we're young!
1249	1252	Do you mind, sir? I'm trying to tee off.
1252	1255	I bet you slice it into the woods. A hundred bucks!
1255	1258	Gambling is illegal at Bushwood, sir, and I never slice!
1263	1264	Damn!
1264	1265	Okay! You can owe me!
1266	1267	I owe you nothing!
1270	1273	Judge Smails, sir, can I talk to you?
1273	1274	You want your driver?
1274	1276	No, he's not my type.
1276	1279	Hey, that's a joke! I'm kidding. Give me the driver.
1281	1284	All right, place your bets! Here we are!
1289	1291	Don't count that! I was interfered with.
1294	1296	What did Mr. Webb shoot this morning?
1296	1298	He doesn't keep score, sir.
1298	1300	I know, but just guess. 80? 75?
1301	1302	More like 68, I think.
1304	1305	I don't believe it.
1309	1311	Why don't you improve your lie?
1311	1312	Yes, yes. Winter rules.
1320	1320	Fore!
1321	1322	Fine shot.
1327	1329	I should have yelled two!
1330	1332	Why don't we walk this off, sir?
1334	1335	What have you got in here, rocks?
1335	1337	Are you kidding? When I was your age...
1337	1341	...l would lug 50 pounds of ice up five, six flights of stairs!
1343	1344	So what?
1345	1347	So let's dance!
1354	1356	Now, what the devil?
1360	1362	The man is a menace!
1365	1366	Cut that off!
1369	1373	Music is a violation of our personal privacy! He's breaking the law!
1374	1377	I've always been fascinated with the law, sir.
1377	1379	Really? What areas?
1379	1382	All areas. Personal privacy, noise statutes....
1382	1385	I'd planned to go to law school after I graduated, but...
1385	1389	...my folks won't have enough money to put me through college.
1389	1391	The world needs ditchdiggers, too.
1393	1394	Nice try.
1400	1403	"Great big gobs of greasy, grimy gopher guts."
1405	1407	How about a nice, cool drink, varmints?
1408	1411	Scum, slime, menace to the golfing industry!
1412	1414	You're a disgrace. You're varmints.
1414	1416	You're one of the lowest members of the food chain...
1416	1419	...and you'll probably be replaced by the rat.
1422	1424	Well, I have been pushed.
1425	1427	It's about time somebody teaches these varmints...
1427	1429	...a little lesson about morality...
1429	1434	...and about what it's like to be a decent, upstanding member of a society!
1436	1437	Come to Carl, varmint.
1443	1445	I guess we're playing for keeps now.
1445	1447	I guess the kidding around is pretty much over.
1448	1449	I guess it's just a matter...
1449	1452	...of pumping about 1 5,000 gallons of water down there...
1452	1454	...to teach you a lesson.
1454	1456	Is that it? I think it is!
1468	1471	-You guys are brothers? -Yeah.
1471	1473	Is this a family business, or what?
1473	1476	They say for ltalians this is skilled labor, you know that?
1477	1479	No, actually, I'm a rich millionaire.
1479	1480	My doctor told me to get out...
1480	1482	...and carry golf bags a couple of times a week.
1483	1486	You're a funny kid. What time are you due back in Boys Town?
1491	1493	Albert Einstein gave me this.
1494	1495	Nice man.
1497	1499	He made a fortune in physics.
1502	1505	I'll tell you, son. My main satisfaction...
1505	1510	...is working with young people like yourself at our new Youtheran Center.
1510	1512	Why don't you drop by some time?
1512	1515	I've often thought of entering the priesthood.
1516	1517	Are you Roman Catholic?
1519	1522	I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you can't come.
1525	1526	Go for it.
1527	1530	You know, I've often thought of becoming a golf club.
1531	1534	Not bad, huh? I'll have 2,000 more units in the next two years!
1535	1537	I bet they'd love a great shopping mall right here!
1537	1540	Condos over there! Plenty of parking.
1540	1542	Country clubs and cemeteries...
1542	1544	...are the biggest wasters of prime real estate!
1544	1548	Dead people? They don't want to be buried nowadays. Ecology, right?
1548	1551	Ask Wang. He'll tell you. We just bought property...
1551	1554	...behind the Great Wall. On the good side!
1558	1559	I want a hamburger.
1560	1561	No, a cheeseburger.
1561	1562	I want a hot dog.
1562	1564	I want a milkshake.
1565	1567	You'll get nothing and like it!
1575	1577	Stop it. The judge will see you.
1577	1579	Are you going out with me tonight?
1579	1582	Yes. To my room? I've got to work in the dining room tonight.
1582	1584	Come work with me. You can bus tables.
1584	1585	I've never done that.
1585	1588	It's easy. You fill the water glass, replace the butter.
1589	1591	If they drop a fork, you give them another one.
1591	1593	I don't think I can handle that.
1597	1599	Put me down for five.
1603	1605	If I can just make this one....
1616	1619	A thousand bucks you miss that putt!
1619	1620	Of all the nerve!
1648	1649	I did not throw it--
1649	1651	If you didn't, how the hell did it get here?
1651	1653	It slipped!
1653	1654	What's the problem?
1654	1656	He almost killed my wife with his damn club!
1656	1659	It was an accident! It slipped out of my hands.
1659	1660	I noticed your grips were worn.
1660	1662	I should've mentioned it before.
1662	1665	I could put some "stick-um" on there for you. It's my fault.
1666	1668	That's a good idea. Next time be more careful!
1670	1673	Kids! Look, I'm terribly sorry this happened.
1674	1677	I'll pay for your lunch and I'll pay for the umbrella.
1679	1682	I'll see you at the table. I'll sign your card.
1692	1694	Thanks for helping me back there.
1694	1697	You're a good caddy. Something to be very proud of.
1699	1703	Do you know we're giving another caddy scholarship this year?
1704	1707	I heard, but my grades in school weren't that outstanding.
1707	1709	There are more important things than grades.
1709	1712	Winning the caddy tournament, for instance...
1712	1715	...might look pretty good on a young fellow's application.
1715	1716	I'm sure going to try.
1716	1720	This is for you. Tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.
1720	1724	If he's as good as he says he is, he's got to play me to prove it!
1724	1725	I will, sir.
1742	1746	License to kill gophers by the government of the United Nations.
1747	1749	Man...free to kill gophers at will.
1750	1752	To kill, you must know your enemy.
1752	1756	In this case, my enemy is a varmint, and a varmint will never quit.
1757	1761	Ever! They're like the Viet Cong. Varmint Cong!
1763	1766	So what you have to do, you have to fall back...
1766	1768	...on superior firepower...
1769	1771	...and superior intelligence.
1773	1775	And that's all she wrote.
1799	1801	Are you going to eat your fat?
1802	1805	You're looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Smails.
1808	1811	You'd be interested to know this uniform was given to me...
1811	1814	...by the Captain of the Links of St. Andrews in Scotland.
1814	1816	They invented the game there, but they call it "gof"...
1816	1818	...without the "L" as we do.
1819	1820	I think I have enough butter.
1820	1822	Right. If you need any more....
1826	1828	So when Mona died last winter, I said to myself:
1828	1831	"Al, if you keep busting your hump 1 6, 20 hours a day...
1831	1833	"...you'll end up with a $60-million funeral! "
1834	1837	Doll, could you scare up another round for our table?
1838	1840	And tell the cook this is low-grade dog food.
1840	1842	Here, take this for yourself.
1843	1845	I had better food at the ballgame!
1846	1850	I tell you, this steak still has marks where the jockey was hitting it.
1851	1853	Anyway, today I just stick to real estate.
1853	1855	With the market these days, if you own anything but land...
1855	1857	...you own a popcorn farm !
1861	1863	Oh, did somebody step on a duck?
1868	1869	Ain't that right, sir?
1869	1872	The graveyard is two blocks to the left, okay?
1873	1876	Dog food? I'll show him dog food!
1880	1884	Hey, where's the bar? Let's have some drinks here.
1884	1888	Waiter, here, this is for you, all right? Oh! Captain Hook!
1889	1890	How about the grand you owe me?
1890	1893	Forget about it. I'm just kidding.
1893	1895	This is your wife? A lovely lady.
1895	1897	Baby, you're all right.
1897	1900	You must have been something before electricity.
1901	1903	Hey, doll, how are you? You live alone?
1904	1907	Hey, Rabbi, nice seeing you. Folks, how are you?
1907	1910	And this is your grandson, huh? Oh, wonderful boy!
1910	1912	Yeah, he's a good boy.
1912	1914	Now I know why tigers eat their young.
1919	1921	The dance of the living dead!
1921	1923	I know why you came here tonight.
1923	1924	Why?
1924	1927	That girl. Listen, I'd put that idea right out of your mind.
1927	1930	She's been plucked more times than the Rose of Tralee.
1930	1932	Biggest whore on Fifth Avenue, I'm told!
1953	1956	Pay no attention to that bush moving around there by that tree.
1957	1959	It's just a bush. Don't even look twice at it.
1959	1961	Nothing to be alarmed about.
1965	1968	This looks like it could be gravy.
1983	1985	I smell varmint poontang.
1986	1989	The only good varmint poontang is dead varmint poontang...
1991	1992	...l think.
2014	2016	Ty, there's someone you must meet!
2018	2020	AI built our condo in Palm Beach.
2020	2022	I need a drink. Nice meeting you.
2025	2028	I think someone is giving you the big eye!
2036	2038	Hey! Can you make a bullshot?
2039	2040	Can you make a shoe smell?
2040	2044	Very funny. Why don't you get yourself a real haircut? Here, take this.
2044	2046	What people here! Look at that one.
2047	2050	The last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it!
2056	2060	So what brings you to this nape of the woods...neck of the wape?
2060	2061	How come you're here?
2061	2063	Daddy wanted to broaden me.
2064	2066	In this place? Good luck!
2067	2069	What do you do for excitement?
2070	2072	Oh, l...play a lot of golf.
2073	2075	Golf? Nixon plays golf.
2078	2080	I bet you have a lot of interesting stories...
2080	2082	...about your ball landing in the road.
2084	2085	So what do you do?
2087	2089	I enjoy...skinny-skiing...
2091	2093	...going to bullfights on acid....
2098	2100	I'll bet you've got a lot of nice ties.
2104	2105	What do you mean?
2107	2110	You want to tie me up with some of your ties...Ty?
2112	2114	I've got a good idea.
2115	2118	Let's pretend...we're real human beings.
2120	2121	Freeze, gopher!
2163	2166	Who is that disgusting man over there?
2166	2169	I tell you, I never saw dead people smoke before!
2169	2171	A guest of the Scotts.
2173	2175	What do you say we bust up this joint?
2177	2179	You two should get a room, you know?
2179	2181	Ringo, play something hot, will you?
2181	2184	And you guys...take some more lessons!
2192	2195	Judge, give someone else a chance! You lucky devil!
2195	2199	Come here, honey! And loosen up! You're a lot of woman, you know?
2199	2202	You want to make $14 the hard way?
2202	2205	You! You! You're no gentleman!
2206	2208	I'm no doorknob, either.
2208	2211	I never want to see that man here again!
2237	2240	Wait up, girls. I've got a salami I've got to hide.
2240	2243	I told you! Today is the day we change the holes!
2245	2247	Go do it now! No more slacking off!
2248	2251	I'll slack you off, you fuzzy little foreigner...
2251	2254	...and I'll fill your bagpipes with Wheatena!
2257	2259	Man in a boat overboard.
2260	2261	You beast!
2262	2263	You savage.
2264	2266	Come on, bark like a dog for me.
2266	2270	Bark like a dog! I will teach you the meaning of the word "respect" !
2278	2281	I've just got to win that caddy tournament!
2281	2283	I owe it to my folks to get that scholarship.
2283	2285	Why do you want to go to college?
2285	2286	I don't know.
2287	2288	Let me tell you a story.
2288	2291	I once knew a guy who could've been a great golfer. Could've gone pro.
2291	2294	All he needed was a little time and some practice.
2294	2296	He decided to go to college instead.
2297	2300	He went for four years. Did pretty well.
2300	2303	At the end of his four years, his last semester, he was kicked out.
2303	2305	You know what for?
2307	2310	He was night-putting. Just putting at night...
2310	2313	...with the 1 5-year-old daughter of the Dean.
2316	2318	You know who that guy was?
2318	2320	No.
2320	2321	Take one good guess.
2322	2323	Bob Hope.
2326	2329	No, that guy was Mitch Cumstein...
2329	2330	...my roommate.
2330	2334	He's a good guy. Don't be obsessed with your desires, Danny.
2336	2338	The Zen philosopher, Basho, once wrote:
2339	2342	"A flute with no holes is not a flute...
2344	2346	"...and a doughnut with no hole is a Danish."
2346	2348	He was a funny guy.
2363	2365	You missed just that one.
2365	2367	In one physical model of the universe...
2367	2370	...the shortest distance between two points is a straight line...
2370	2372	...in the opposite direction.
2374	2375	Unbelievable!
2375	2376	Thank you very little.
2393	2395	You're on the tee!
2407	2408	Nice form.
2409	2410	Good luck, sucker.
2448	2451	-Shit! -No, no! Nice shot! Right on the beach.
2456	2458	Okay, Danny, this is for the Gold.
2462	2464	You ain't got it today, Noonan.
2492	2494	Excellent round, son!
2500	2502	I'm having a party at the Yacht Club this Sunday.
2502	2504	I'm christening my new sloop.
2505	2506	What are you doing this Sunday?
2506	2508	-No plans. -Great!
2508	2510	How would you like to mow my lawn?
2510	2514	I figured a college-bound fellow could use a few extra dollars.
2515	2517	And when you're finished...
2517	2520	...why don't you drop by the Yacht Club?
2524	2525	Smile!
2532	2534	How about we go swimming?
2534	2537	I don't have the swimwear. Besides, I've never swum.
2538	2539	I'll teach you.
2539	2543	Why don't you come on in and help me sort my holy cards first?
2548	2550	Now...Maggie's pants.
2618	2620	Hey, Bigfoot, don't trip in the water!
2621	2622	That's it!
2639	2640	You put your suit on!
2640	2642	You shave your ass!
2662	2664	Hi, Maggie. How was it?
2665	2666	How was what?
2668	2671	I guess it couldn't have been that great, then.
2671	2673	A lot you fucking know, D'Annunzio!
2675	2676	All right. Stand up!
2677	2678	All right! Okay!
2686	2687	She's incredible!
2739	2740	Hi, Mama.
2785	2787	Hey, you guys, cool it!
2790	2791	I mean it!
2803	2804	Want some?
2804	2805	Give me some.
2805	2806	Who asked you?
2806	2807	Come on! I'm asking.
2812	2814	Hey, thanks a lot!
2836	2839	Stop that, you two! All of you!
2839	2841	I want you out of that pool at once!
2843	2846	I don't want to see another caddy body in this pool!
2847	2849	Did you understand what I said? Out!
2851	2852	Take your hands off her, young man!
2852	2854	Put your clothes back on!
2854	2856	Out! Didn't you hear me?
2856	2857	Doodie!
2863	2864	Don't touch it!
2876	2877	Spaulding! No!
2881	2882	Doodie!
2891	2894	If you find anything that doesn't look like it....
2894	2898	I want the entire pool scrubbed, sterilized and disinfected!
2908	2909	There it is!
2914	2916	It's no big deal!
2947	2949	Well, hello! Surprise, surprise!
2951	2953	-Are you busy? -No, come on in.
2953	2954	Go ahead. It's nothing.
2954	2957	I tried calling, but there is no listing for "Mr. Wonderful."
2957	2959	What spelling did you use?
2959	2962	Sorry about this mess. Let me just clean up here.
2962	2964	I'm getting ready for the season.
2964	2965	Duck?
2966	2968	No, no. Dolphin.
2969	2971	Would you like a drink? Tuna Colada, perhaps?
2971	2974	Anything. Who's your decorator, Benihana?
2976	2979	No, I brought most of that stuff back from Vietnam.
2979	2980	You were in the war?
2981	2983	Uh...no.... Homo.
2987	2989	Much better now, though.
2992	2995	Here's an uncashed check for $70,000.
2996	2997	Keep it.
2998	3001	There's a bunch of them ! And a summons.
3003	3004	It's yours.
3005	3006	Pretty pathetic, Ty.
3007	3010	Pathetic? Maybe for you, Lacey.
3011	3014	For me, there's a subtle perfection in everything I do.
3015	3017	I've got my own standards, my own way.
3017	3019	My uncle says you've got a screw loose.
3019	3021	Your uncle molests collies.
3022	3024	And you're rather...
3024	3026	...attractive for...
3027	3030	...a beautiful girl with a great body.
3052	3054	Sing me a love song.
3054	3055	I'm going to.
3057	3058	This stuff is terrible.
3058	3060	It's good. You don't know how to do it.
3060	3061	How do I do it?
3061	3063	I'm going to show you.
3067	3069	"l was born to love you.
3071	3073	"l was born to lick your face.
3074	3076	"l was born to rub you...
3078	3080	"...but you were born to rub me first."
3080	3082	Let's go onto the...patio.
3095	3097	You know what this is called in the East?
3097	3099	It's the "big rub."
3100	3103	You're very...small-breasted.
3103	3105	No, I was kidding.
3105	3106	I'll work my way down.
3106	3108	This is the lsle of Wight.
3108	3112	Careful. I'm going to move right down the Ticonic Parkway...
3112	3114	...over to your clavula....
3114	3116	Will you get serious?
3116	3118	That's a very "in" thing to say.
3120	3122	Ow! That hurts!
3122	3123	You're blocking!
3124	3126	Just hold on to your choppers.
3127	3129	I'll just get a little more oil.
3132	3135	Now I've done it. You get that way from.... Oh, I'm sorry.
3136	3137	It's like reaching under the rug.
3137	3138	You're crazy!
3138	3141	That's what they said about Son of Sam. You know something else?
3142	3144	I'm a very qualified acupuncturist.
3145	3146	Don't even think about it!
3146	3148	I'm just going to eat these.
3148	3151	I want you to know about it. It's like acupressure but it's acupuncture.
3152	3155	The slightest prick and you wouldn't even know--
3155	3156	I'll kill you!
3156	3157	No, I did not do that.
3160	3161	You feel looser?
3162	3164	I feel like $1 00.
3166	3169	Will you forget the massage...
3169	3171	...and just kiss me, you fool.
3201	3203	Hey, what kind of shit is this?
3203	3205	It's the best, man. I got it from a Negro.
3206	3210	You're probably so high already you don't even know it.
3215	3217	He looks like Dick Cavett.
3226	3228	Hey, save me a toke!
3229	3231	Got to do my "doctor" thing.
3235	3238	All right, everybody, it's time to christen the sloop!
3239	3243	Come along, children. You can shake your booties down on the dock.
3247	3251	Ahoy, polloi. What did you just come from, a Scotch ad?
3253	3254	Eat it, Spaulding!
3254	3258	My, what a nice looking young man! You're from Bushwood, aren't you?
3259	3261	He's not a member, Grandma. He's a caddy!
3262	3263	Judge Smails invited me at the Club.
3264	3267	Of course. You're the young man who wants to be in the Senate.
3268	3270	Well, you two look like a couple of boogies.
3270	3272	Why don't you just scamper along now?
3273	3275	May I escort you out, ma'am?
3275	3278	Hold on, son. Are you trying to make time with my best girl?
3279	3282	I want you to meet Chuck Schick. He's clerking for me this summer...
3282	3284	...until he passes the bar.
3285	3287	See you on deck, Senator!
3292	3293	I'm going to law school, too.
3293	3295	Really? Are you going to Harvard?
3295	3298	No. St. Copius of Northern....
3298	3299	Where?
3300	3302	Hey, Cary Grant. You want to get high?
3303	3305	Wait a minute! I've only got a little.
3305	3306	Then split. Okay?
3310	3311	'Bye, Chuck.
3316	3319	Guess I'm a little overdressed, huh?
3319	3321	Depends on what's underneath.
3324	3328	I have a little poem I'd like to read in honor of this occasion, if I may.
3329	3331	Spaulding, get your foot off the boat!
3332	3335	"lt's easy to grin when your ship comes in...
3337	3339	"...and you've got the stock market beat.
3340	3343	"But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile...
3345	3348	"...when his shorts are too tight in the seat! "
3351	3353	Okay, Pookie, do the honors.
3353	3356	Bless this ship and all who sail on her.
3357	3360	I christen thee "The Flying Wasp."
3365	3366	This is your fate line.
3368	3370	You're going to make a lot of money when you're older.
3370	3372	Yeah? When? How?
3373	3376	Could be in the market or on a game show.
3378	3381	And this is your saliva line.
3383	3384	What does it tell?
3385	3386	How hot I can get you.
3390	3393	Well, don't just stand there! Go get some glue!
3394	3395	Hey! My buddy!
3395	3399	Full steam ahead! Over there. I want to go over there!
3400	3402	Move over Swanson. I'm driving!
3409	3411	My dinghy is bigger than your whole boat!
3412	3414	Save me a parking place! I'm coming in!
3422	3423	Heave off!
3425	3426	Get back, you idiot!
3440	3442	I almost got head from Amelia Earhart!
3449	3451	What is this? Hell's Angels?
3467	3468	Reverse!
3492	3493	Back!
3494	3496	Which way is backwards?
3498	3499	Stop! Stop!
3502	3503	Okay. Drop anchor!
3510	3512	Hey, you scratched my anchor!
3554	3557	I just want you to know that because of this...
3558	3561	...you don't have to stop seeing other people.
3594	3595	You!
3596	3597	Your robe, Your Honor.
3603	3605	I don't believe anybody's home.
3615	3616	Thanks a lot!
3620	3622	Are we still having tea?
3629	3632	Will you come and loofah my stretch marks?
3653	3654	That must be the tea.
3660	3663	What an incredible Cinderella story!
3663	3666	This unknown comes out of nowhere to lead the pack.
3666	3668	He's on his final hole.
3671	3675	He's about 455 yards away. He's going to hit about a two iron, I think.
3679	3683	Well, he got out of that. The crowd is standing on its feet.
3684	3685	The normally reserved crowd...
3686	3687	...is going wild!
3692	3694	For this young Cinderella who has come out of nowhere...
3694	3697	...he's got about 350 yards left. He'll get a five iron...
3697	3699	...l would expect. Don't you think?
3701	3704	He's got a beautiful back swing. That's...oh! He got out of that one!
3706	3709	He's got to be pleased with that. The crowd is on its feet here.
3710	3711	He's a Cinderella boy.
3712	3715	Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he lines up this last shot.
3715	3718	He's got about 195 yards left, and...
3719	3720	...looks like he's got an eight iron.
3720	3725	This crowd has gone deadly silent. Cinderella story. Out of nowhere.
3725	3729	A former greenskeeper now about to become the Master's champion.
3732	3734	It's in the hole!
3737	3740	I was hoping to squeeze in nine holes before this rain starts.
3742	3743	Certainly, Your Eminency.
3744	3745	Take my bag.
3765	3767	You better put this on.
3767	3768	That's a great shot.
3769	3773	I can't believe the way you hit the ball, sir. You really covered it.
3773	3775	We better start moving.
3784	3785	Did you see that?
3786	3787	Miracle!
3787	3791	Nice shot, Bishop. You must have made a deal with the devil!
3791	3793	I could break the Club record.
3794	3797	You better come in until this blows over.
3805	3806	So what do you think?
3807	3808	I'd keep playing.
3808	3811	I don't think the heavy stuff will come down for a while.
3811	3812	You're right.
3812	3815	Anyway, the good Lord would never disrupt...
3816	3818	...the best game of my life.
3826	3828	I'm infallible, young fella!
3835	3837	Come on! One more hole!
3852	3853	Ratfarts!
3891	3892	You're here early.
3896	3898	I kind of slept here last night.
3905	3907	I'm in big trouble.
3907	3909	Yeah? Me too. I'm late!
3913	3914	Late for what?
3914	3916	For not being pregnant!
3920	3922	I don't hold you responsible!
3923	3925	It's my problem. I can handle it.
3934	3937	I'm not going to let you go through this alone.
3937	3938	Whatever you decide.
3938	3941	I'm going to have it! I've already decided!
3945	3946	That's it, then.
3948	3950	We'll just get married.
3950	3952	Oh, God! That's all I need!
3954	3955	No, I want to, all right?
3955	3957	No, you don't!
3957	3958	Yes, I do!
3961	3963	Look, I don't want to get married!
3964	3966	Come on, Maggie. You're just saying that.
3966	3967	No, I'm not!
3969	3971	It might not be yours. Okay?
3974	3976	You're making this up about the other guys...
3976	3978	...so I won't feel guilty.
3978	3979	I'm not making it up!
3979	3982	All right. Well, I'm still willing to marry you!
3983	3984	Well, thanks for nothing!
3991	3994	You're a good egg, Noonan. She needs you.
3997	3999	Pick up that Kleenex.
4000	4004	The judge would like to see the caddy Danny Noonan as soon as he comes in.
4005	4006	I'm Danny Noonan.
4007	4009	Would you come with me, please?
4020	4021	Judge Smails, sir?
4021	4022	Sit down, Danny.
4030	4032	I think you know why you're here.
4033	4037	So I'll do us the courtesy of not reviewing what happened yesterday.
4039	4043	My niece is the kind of girl that has a certain zest for living.
4044	4048	The last thing any of us needs now is a lot of loose talk about her behavior.
4048	4051	I swear I didn't tell anybody anything, sir.
4052	4053	Good. Good.
4055	4057	You know, despite what happened...
4057	4061	...l'm still convinced that you have many fine qualities.
4061	4064	I think you can still become a gentleman someday...
4064	4068	...if you understand and abide by the rules of decent society.
4074	4077	There's a lot of...well, badness in the world today.
4078	4080	I see it in court every day.
4081	4084	I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber.
4084	4087	I didn't want to do it. I felt I owed it to them.
4091	4095	The most important decision you can make right now is what you stand for.
4098	4099	Goodness...
4100	4101	...or badness.
4103	4107	I've made some mistakes in the past. I'm willing to make up for that.
4109	4110	I want to be good!
4113	4114	Very good!
4118	4122	I know how hard it is for young people today and I want to help.
4123	4126	Just ask my grandson, Spaulding. He and I are regular pals.
4128	4130	Are you my pal...
4130	4132	..."Mr. Scholarship Winner"?
4139	4141	Yes, sir! I'm your pal!
4144	4145	How about a Fresca?
4156	4158	Another rob roy, Bishop?
4158	4161	You never ask a navy man if he'll have another drink...
4162	4164	...because it's nobody's goddamn business...
4164	4166	...how many drinks he's had already, right?
4166	4169	Wrong! You're drinking too much, Your Excellency.
4170	4172	"Excellency," fiddlesticks!
4173	4176	My name is Fred and I'm just a man, same as you are.
4176	4179	You're not a man. You're a bishop, for God's sake!
4179	4180	There is no God!
4181	4185	Webb, I didn't see your name on the sign-in sheet for the Club tournament.
4186	4188	I thought you'd be the man to beat this year.
4188	4191	Guess you'll just have to keep beating yourself.
4194	4197	Come on, honey. Let's go. How are you, boys?
4199	4201	Hey, we're both starving. When do we eat?
4204	4207	You have worn out your welcome, sir!
4207	4210	Is that so? Who made you Pope of this dump?
4210	4212	Bushwood...a "dump"?
4212	4215	Well, I'll guarantee you'll never be a member here!
4216	4219	Are you kidding? You think I'd join this crummy "snobatorium"?
4220	4222	Why, this whole place sucks!
4222	4225	That's right. The only reason I'm here is maybe I'll buy it!
4225	4227	Buy Bushwood! You...?
4233	4235	I get no respect from anyone!
4235	4236	Please! What's going on?
4236	4239	He tried to choke me! You saw it.
4239	4241	He called me a baboon. Thinks I'm his wife.
4241	4242	I'm calling the police!
4242	4244	Call the chief of police! I built his condo!
4244	4246	Out! I want him out of here!
4246	4248	Let's go, Beeper!
4251	4253	Judge! Come on, let's be adults here!
4253	4255	Let's not mess the place up. We can handle this in private.
4255	4257	Let's go to your office.
4257	4260	I'll make some drinks for us all. We'll talk about it. Come on.
4280	4281	Are you flipping out?
4281	4284	No, I'm happy! I'm not pregnant!
4286	4287	That's great.
4289	4291	You were sweet and I'm sorry I was hard on you.
4291	4294	No, I deserved it. I've been acting like a jerk.
4294	4296	I hate myself. I'm gonna get that scholarship.
4296	4297	That's good, isn't it?
4298	4300	No, I've been a creep lately. I just can't help it.
4300	4302	You're not a creep.
4302	4302	Yes, I am.
4302	4304	No, you're not.
4304	4306	All right, maybe you are a little bit.
4306	4310	Listen, you're good deep down. I know you'll do the right thing.
4313	4315	I demand satisfaction!
4315	4317	Oh, you want satisfaction?
4318	4320	I'll tell you what's real satisfying...cash!
4320	4323	I'll shoot you 1 8 holes for $1 0,000.
4327	4330	Why, I could beat you with one arm.
4330	4334	How about teams for $20,000? You can have "Dr. Frankenputz."
4334	4335	I beg your pardon!
4336	4337	And I'll take Ty.
4338	4341	Hey, fellows. Don't include me. I don't have time.
4341	4344	Come on. You're an ace. Everybody knows it!
4346	4349	I don't play golf for money... against people.
4350	4352	Are you religious or something?
4352	4354	You might say that.
4359	4362	Can I have a word with you? ln private.
4364	4365	Sure thing, Judge.
4375	4377	Your father and I prepped together...
4377	4380	...went to war together, played golf together.
4380	4382	We built this Club, he and I !
4382	4384	Let's face it. Some people...
4385	4387	...simply do not belong.
4391	4393	Let's not...cave in too easy.
4404	4405	What do you say, Ty?
4412	4414	Let's make it $40,000.
4414	4416	Great!
4420	4422	My dad...never liked you.
4422	4426	I'll see you two tomorrow morning on the golf course!
4427	4428	Beautiful!
4434	4435	I have to laugh...
4437	4439	...because I've often asked myself...
4439	4443	...my foe, my enemy, is an animal. In order to conquer him...
4444	4447	...l have to think like an animal and whenever possible...
4448	4449	...to look like one.
4453	4454	I've got to get inside...
4454	4457	...this dude's pelt and crawl around for a few days.
4457	4460	Who is the gopher's ally? His friend?
4461	4464	The harmless squirrel and the friendly rabbit.
4464	4468	I'm going to use you guys to do my dirty work for me.
4478	4480	Look at that. It's the gopher.
4498	4500	There she is!
4504	4506	This is it! It's a Titleist!
4523	4525	All right, show yourself, little varmint!
4525	4526	If you've got the guts!
4527	4529	Son of a bitch.
4529	4531	Where did you go? Oh, hi, Carl.
4537	4539	Mind if I play through?
4539	4542	Sure. Go right ahead. Are you getting in a late night or something?
4542	4544	I was just loosening up a bit.
4544	4545	Was that your ball I heard rambling through here?
4546	4547	Yeah. Did you see my ball?
4550	4551	Titleist?
4551	4553	-That's it! -It's right here.
4554	4555	Is this your place?
4556	4557	What do you think?
4559	4560	It's really awful.
4561	4564	Well, I have a lot of things on order. You know, credit trouble.
4564	4565	I'm an assistant greenskeeper.
4565	4568	They say that doesn't mean anything until I'm the head greenskeeper.
4568	4569	Can you get me a ruling on this?
4569	4570	Make yourself comfortable.
4571	4573	No, I don't want to stick to anything.
4573	4575	Take this thing off. This is dirty.
4575	4576	Don't go to any trouble.
4579	4580	Fire her up.
4580	4582	With my lips?
4582	4584	Go ahead. Right back.
4584	4586	If I could just borrow a wedge or something.
4586	4589	If you'd open a curtain, I could get right through the window.
4589	4591	People say I'm an idiot...
4591	4593	...because all I do is cut lawns for a living.
4593	4596	People don't say that about you, as far as you know.
4596	4599	Well, I'm working on it so I don't ever have to....
4599	4601	I'll be the head greenskeeper...
4601	4603	...hopefully within six years. That's my schedule.
4603	4607	But I am studying this stuff, so I know it...you know, like...
4607	4609	...chinch bugs. You know...
4609	4613	...manganese. A lot of people don't even know what that is.
4614	4615	Nitrogen....
4615	4617	Just open a curtain and I can just get out--
4617	4621	I invented my own kind of grass, too. Did you know that? Look at this.
4621	4623	This is registered: Carl Spackler's Bench.
4624	4627	I've felt grass like this before. I've played on this stuff.
4627	4630	This is a hybrid. This is a cross of bluegrass...
4630	4633	...Kentucky bluegrass, featherbed bench...
4633	4635	...and northern California sinsemilla.
4636	4637	The amazing stuff about this is...
4637	4640	...that you can play 36 holes on it in the afternoon...
4641	4643	...take it home and just get stoned...
4643	4645	...at night on this stuff.
4645	4647	I've got pounds of this stuff.
4649	4652	Say, let's have a little bit of this. Look at this. Try it.
4653	4655	I really don't do this very often.
4655	4658	You'll love it. This is dynamite. Watch out.
4658	4660	Well, maybe one drag, then I've got to go.
4667	4670	It's a little harsh. Here. Cannonball it!
4674	4676	Cannonball it right back...
4679	4683	...then one more of these right on top of it! Cannonball coming!
4689	4692	Can I have a drop? Just a drop...myself?
4695	4697	That's fine for me. That's good.
4698	4700	Can I say something to you?
4703	4705	You've been acting psychotically lately.
4707	4708	Why?
4708	4712	I've been a little under strain. I have to play with Smails tomorrow...
4712	4714	...in a money match.
4714	4716	If he bothers you, I'll take care of him.
4717	4720	What you've got to do is cut the hamstring on the back of his leg...
4720	4722	...right at the bottom.
4722	4723	He'll never play golf again...
4723	4726	...because his weight displacement goes back...
4726	4728	...all his weight is on his right foot...
4728	4730	...and he'll push everything off to the right.
4730	4733	He'll never come through on anything. He'll quit the game.
4733	4735	That would work. I'll call you if I need help.
4735	4737	But, seriously, no b.s...
4738	4741	...if you ever want to rap or just get weird with somebody....
4742	4744	You know...buddies.
4744	4746	I'll drop by. You drop by my place any time.
4746	4749	What's your address? You're on Briar, right?
4750	4752	Do you have a pool?
4753	4756	A pool and a pond. A pond would be good for you.
4756	4758	Natural spring.
4759	4763	Anything would be good. Well, I'm going to clean this up.
4763	4765	You go ahead and clean up. It looks fine to me.
4765	4767	Thanks for the dope.
4781	4783	You carry my bag.
4793	4797	Get back there! What do you think you're doing? Get off of here!
4798	4800	This is a golf course, not a parking lot!
4801	4803	Now back this thing out of here right now!
4804	4806	Hey, look at that!
4806	4808	Don't play games with me.
4808	4810	Put the steering wheel here where it belongs...
4810	4812	...and get this out of here!
4813	4815	Let's play golf!
4818	4820	Don't do it! I didn't do that!
4822	4823	Oh, there's my phone!
4823	4825	Gentlemen, it's about time we....
4826	4830	I told you never to call me on the golf course! What's that? Then sell!
4830	4832	They're all selling? Then buy!
4833	4836	I'll tell you what, let me have the Coast. Any Coast!
4836	4838	What do you want?
4838	4839	Can I use your phone? I have a call.
4839	4841	Is it a long distance?
4842	4846	Gentlemen, we all know this is illegal and against Club practice...
4846	4848	...and I'd like to ask at this time...
4848	4852	...if you all agree to waive all sanction against said referee...
4853	4856	...or anything that might get me fired.
4859	4861	The match is for $20,000 each.
4861	4865	Lowest score wins the hole in regulation match play.
4866	4869	I have a number of tees in my hand. Your Honor, odd or even?
4869	4870	Odd!
4870	4873	Odd, it is. Your honor, Your Honor.
4875	4878	Hey, tiger, here. Keep it fair, will you?
4878	4879	No, I can't accept this.
4884	4885	Driver, please.
4894	4896	Don't smile at me a lot, okay?
4903	4907	The Judge and Mr. Czervik have a $1 00,000 match going on!
4909	4911	What do you want to do?
4913	4914	Five on Mr. Czech.
4921	4922	Hello? Anybody home?
4925	4928	Hello, Mr. Gopher! It's me, Mr. Squirrel.
4932	4933	Just a harmless squirrel.
4933	4936	Not a plastic explosive or anything. Nothing to be worried about.
4936	4940	I'm just here to make your last hours on earth as peaceful as possible.
4940	4943	Don't mind this. This is doctor's orders.
4943	4946	You don't mind if I just pop in there for a few laughs?
4946	4949	That's right. Or in the words of Jean-Paul Sartre:
4950	4952	"Au revoir, gopher."
4955	4956	This is going to be sweet.
4976	4978	That kangaroo stole my ball!
4994	4995	"What's up, Doc?"
5026	5029	I don't understand it! I'm playing the worst game of my life!
5031	5033	Don't put yourself down, Al.
5033	5036	You're not...you're not good. You stink.
5043	5046	Fifty bucks the Smails kid picks his nose.
5052	5054	All right, kid, take your time.
5060	5062	Fifty bucks more says he eats it.
5064	5065	Don't do it, kid!
5076	5077	That kid will eat anything!
5077	5078	He was hungry.
5078	5081	What do you say, Al? Shall we press on?
5083	5085	Hey, Judge, cheer up, will you?
5086	5089	My boat needs exactly $20,000 worth of repairs.
5091	5094	So does your brain! You want to double it?
5095	5096	Fine! $40,000 apiece!
5097	5099	All right! You've got it!
5102	5106	Hold on, Judge! That's my office. I better get going.
5106	5109	No. You're in for half of $80,000.
5111	5113	Probably just a routine emergency.
5137	5141	Why did I double it? I should have stayed home and played with myself!
5144	5147	I saw Smails before. He was cheating.
5149	5152	Nobody likes a tattletale... except, of course, me.
5160	5162	My arm ! It's broken!
5163	5165	What has this buffoon done now?
5165	5169	Okay, let's have a look. That might be a fractured ulna.
5169	5171	I'm afraid you forfeit.
5171	5174	Who says so? The match is a draw!
5174	5176	You don't play, you lose. Right, Lou?
5177	5179	That's right, unless you allow him a substitute.
5182	5184	Spaulding can play out his holes.
5184	5188	Actually, Judge, I think it's up to us to pick a substitute.
5189	5191	Who do you want?
5191	5194	Sonja Henie is out. We'll take Danny Noonan.
5196	5198	Danny is an employee of the Club.
5198	5202	He can't work and play, particularly in something as illegal as this!
5202	5204	Makes a lot of sense.
5205	5207	If you win, I'll make it worth your while.
5215	5217	I'll play.
5217	5219	You don't want that scholarship, do you?
5219	5220	I guess I don't.
5220	5222	I guess you don't!
5255	5257	Don't worry. It's good luck.
5259	5260	In Haiti!
5284	5286	You've got to win this hole.
5286	5288	I thought winning wasn't important.
5288	5289	Me winning isn't! You do!
5290	5291	Great grammar.
5296	5299	See your future. Be...your future.
5300	5301	Make...make it!
5303	5306	Make your future. I'm a veg, Danny.
5306	5309	Give me this. Take it easy, will you, Ty?
5327	5328	Hey, Mr. Gopher?
5334	5338	Gentlemen, this match is all even. Final hole. Doctor, you are away.
5369	5372	Spaulding, this calls for the old Billy Baroo.
5390	5391	This is a biggie!
5392	5393	Don't let me down, Billy!
5393	5395	Forty thousand dollars...Billy!
5405	5406	I knew you'd do it!
5449	5452	"Silver wings upon their chest...
5455	5458	"...these are men, America's best."
5465	5468	Don't worry about this one. If you miss it, we lose.
5488	5490	Hey, Judge! Double or nothing he makes it!
5490	5492	Eighty thousand dollars!
5495	5496	What's that, Judge?
5498	5499	You're on!
5505	5506	We're waiting!
5514	5516	Noonan...you can do it!
5550	5551	You lose it, buddy!
5555	5556	Fore!
5600	5601	It's a birdie!
5642	5645	All right, Smails, that's 80 grand. Now fork it over!
5645	5649	I'll give you nothing! Absolutely nothing, you understand!
5650	5652	I figured as much! Hey, Moose!
5652	5654	Rocco! Help the judge find his checkbook.
5656	5658	Well, l...l will.
5660	5663	Hey, everybody! We're all going to get laid!
