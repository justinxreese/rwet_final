153	154	You in the robes.
154	156	Put down the weapon of mass destruction
156	157	and get on the ground!
157	161	You are under arrest.
170	174	Put down your weapons now!
174	176	Why can't we ever do this the easy way?
185	189	World Police. Get down on the ground!
197	199	Hey terrorist.
199	203	Terrorize this.
212	216	All right. Let's make this interesting.
241	245	You lose.
245	247	He is getting away with the WMD.
247	251	I got him.
259	261	Damn, I missed him.
261	262	Sarah, he has got the bomb.
262	265	You got a fix?
265	266	I got him Carson.
266	270	He is heading for Louvre.
270	273	Your plans are over.
282	285	All right Sarah.
285	287	Nothing to it.
287	290	All right. Let's make this interesting.
290	293	Bonjour everyone. Don't worry!
293	295	Everything is bombed
295	299	We stopped the terrorists.
307	310	I was doing a lot of thinking on the ride over here.
310	312	Oh yeah? Bout what?
312	316	I was thinking that I want you to marry me.
316	317	Don't joke about that!
317	320	Who's joking?
322	325	Joe to Sarah. Looks like we may need to order up a wedding cake.
325	327	He finally popped the question?
327	329	Lisa you are an amazing woman ...
329	331	and a damn fine cop.
331	334	I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

353	355	Carson!
355	357	Feel so cold.
357	360	You have to hang on Carson.
360	363	Sorry babe. Looks like this was a one-way ticket.
363	366	No!
366	370	Lisa you have to live on, Find someone else who will love you.
370	372	Find someone else and be happy.

482	483	Great job Gary.
483	485	Thanks, you too Steve.
485	486	That was the greatest acting I have ever seen.
486	488	I just don't know how do you do it Gary?
488	492	How do you make youself so sober and emotional to make everybody cry like that?
492	493	It's not that hard really.
493	497	I just think about the saddest moment in my life.
501	505	Man wow! Gary is such a great guy
518	520	Hello young man!
520	522	Congratulations on a terrific performance.
522	526	Oh, thank you! I don't believe we've met Mr. ...?
527	530	The name is Spottswoode
531	532	Well nice to meet you.
532	534	And you are Gary Justin
534	537	All-American actor who graduated Iowa University
537	538	Summa cum laude with a double major in...
538	540	theater and world languages
540	543	You've been at the top of every acting class since you were a child.
543	547	Top gun actor.
547	550	Hey hold on a second are you from Hollywood?
550	552	I have an incredible offer for you Gary.
552	556	If you are interested follow me this way.
573	577	Please Gary, step into my car.
578	579	Oh I get it!
579	582	I'm supposed to get in your car and let you put your finger inside me.
582	585	Then if I go down on you I get a movie part.
586	589	No I just want to show you something
589	590	Yeah, I bet you do
590	592	Please Gary I'm not from Hollywood
592	593	I am not going to fuck your mouth...
593	595	and my time is extremely valuable!
606	608	Jesus this is a nice limo.
608	612	Yes it is! Now suck my cock!
612	616	Haha! Just kidding.
621	624	All right. Just what the hell is this about?
624	627	I hate to break this to you Gary ...
627	630	but some people out there want you dead.
630	631	Dead?
631	632	They are called terrorists, Gary ...
632	634	and they hate everything about you.
635	638	Why? What did I do to them? I am just a Broadway actor.
638	641	It's not who you are Gary. It's what you stand for.
641	643	And every single mintue of every single day
643	645	The terrorists are planning new ways to kill you.
645	648	And everyone else who lives in a free country.
649	653	The only thing standing in their way...is us.
654	656	You?
656	659	Baxter, I think we can valmorphanize safely now.
690	692	OK a limousine that can fly!
692	694	Now I have seen everything!
694	697	Really? Have you seen a man eat his own head?
697	701	- No - So then you haven't seen everything and neither have we.
702	706	Last week in Paris we got four terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction.
707	710	The terrorists are planning something very big.
711	713	And just what does this have to do with me?
713	715	Our only hope is to have somebody act like a terrorist...
715	718	who wants to help them carry out the attack.
718	719	An actor convincing enough
719	721	to make the terrorists think he is one of them.
723	725	This is crazy. I am an actor not a spy.
725	727	That's all spying is...Acting!
727	729	And they say you are the best!
729	732	An actor with a double major in theater and world languages.
732	736	Hell you are the perfect weapon Gary.
737	741	Look out!
767	771	Right this way you maverick renegade.
782	785	Welcome to team base.
785	789	Gary, this is Joe. All-star quarterback from the University of Nebraska.
789	791	He is a natural born leader.
791	793	I've heard a lot about your acting Mr. Johnston
793	795	I hope it's as good as they say it is.
795	799	And this is Sarah. The top empath from Berkely school for the clairvoyant in San Franciso.
801	805	I sense that you are slightly confused right now.
806	808	That's suppose to be Carson's replacement?
808	809	A fucking actor?
809	813	Don't mind Chris. He may be lacking courtesy but he is the best martial art expert Detroit has to offer.
815	819	That's right actor. Just stay the fuck away from me.
820	823	And finally we have our psychology expert. Where is Lisa?
824	828	Right here.
833	837	Gary, this is Lisa. She specializes in how the terrorists think.
837	841	Usually a case of malignant narcissism brought under in childhood.
842	844	We've been doing our best to keep the world safe, Gary.
844	847	But now somebody has supplied the terrorists with WMDs.
847	850	And Intelligence tells us they plan to use them.
850	852	Isn't that right Intelligence?
852	854	That is affirmative!
854	856	Intelligence?
856	858	The most sophisticated computer in the world.
858	862	I've intercepted communications that several terrorists groups are being organized for one massive world wide attack.
865	869	From what Intelligence has gathered it would be 911 times 100.
871	875	911 times 100 Jesus that's ...
875	879	... yes, 91100.
879	883	Basically all the worst parts of the Bible.
883	885	So now you see why we need you.
885	889	We will disguise you as a terrorist and take you deep into the Middle East. If your acting is successful
890	894	you'll be able to get us all the information we need to stop this whole thing from happening.
895	898	Of course ... if you are not interested ...
898	901	there's the door.
901	905	All right. Thanks.
910	913	Huh.
914	917	Gary, hey. Hold on a second!
917	921	Don't you understand? Every country in the world is in danger.
921	923	How is it my responsibility to do something?
923	927	Because like it or not, you're the one with the power to do something.
930	934	I can't fight terrorists. I don't know nothing about guns or jets.
934	938	That doesn't matter. If you wanna help people all that matters is Gary is what you have here.
947	951	Just think about it, ok. Here, take this.
955	957	Baxter will take you wherever you wanna go.
957	961	Just remember your freedom is at stake too.
973	975	What do you think Spottswoode sees in him ?
975	979	I don't know. But I think I see it too.
995	999	Hey Baxter I wanna take a detour.
1001	1002	# What would you do #
1002	1006	# if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom? #
1008	1014	# What would you do if that is to make the ultimate sacrifice? #
1014	1017	# Would you think about all them people? #
1017	1021	# Who gave up everything they had? #
1021	1025	# Would you think about all them war vets #
1025	1028	# and would you start to feel bad? #
1030	1034	# Freedom isn't free #
1034	1037	# It costs folks like you and me #
1037	1044	# And if we don't all chip in we'll never pay that bill #
1045	1048	# Freedom isn't free #
1048	1052	# No there is a hefty fuckin' fee #
1052	1058	# And if you don't throw in your buck 'o five who will? #
1060	1062	# Buck 'o five #
1062	1067	# Freedom costs a buck 'o five #
1104	1105	Our dear leader Kim Jong-Il...
1105	1107	says the weapons of mass destruction you requested
1107	1109	are ready for you to take.
1109	1111	I am still in the process of recuriting...
1111	1114	and training new terrorists for the attack.
1114	1117	We take weapons later.
1123	1126	He asked what part of the deal you did not understand.
1126	1129	He says perhaps his translator did not make it clear to you.
1129	1133	He says he should fire ... his translator.
1136	1139	Do you have any idea how fucking busy I am?
1139	1141	I can not believe that I actually have a Chenchnen standing here
1141	1144	telling me when he is going to take a delivery.
1144	1146	Hello.
1146	1149	Perhaps we can be ready sooner.
1149	1150	Yes, perhaps you can.
1150	1153	Now take your weapons of mass desctruction and
1153	1156	get the fuck out of here!
1173	1175	I ... had to come back.
1175	1177	I know you did son.
1177	1179	I still say this is a fucking mistake.
1179	1182	Stop it Chris! I sense that you are making him feel intimidated.
1182	1184	Gary I am afraid there is no time.
1184	1186	Intelligence tells us that the attack is imminent.
1186	1190	We need you to act like a Middle Eastern terrorist right away.
1190	1191	There is just one problem.
1191	1194	I don't look Middle Eastern.
1194	1198	Hahaha - leave that to us!
1208	1212	Sarah is a professional at skin graphing and laser valmorphication.
1213	1217	Just try to be still.
1250	1252	Amazing!
1252	1254	The valmorphication completely worked.
1254	1258	Sit up and take a look Gary!
1262	1264	It's uncanny.
1264	1266	You are going to fool everyone Gary.
1266	1269	...or should I say Hakmed?
1271	1274	All right team, we only get one shot at this so listen up!
1274	1277	Intelligence has intercepted communications that terrorists
1277	1280	from different countries are gathering at a tavern! Here! In Cairo.
1281	1284	Cairo ... that's in Egypt.
1284	1286	Exactly right Joe.
1286	1287	Now team your mission.
1287	1289	We'll be to get Gary into that tavern.
1289	1292	And once he is on the inside, cover his back!
1293	1295	Gary, you must use your acting to find out
1295	1298	any information you can from the terrorists.
1300	1303	Gary, if for some reason you cover is blown...
1303	1305	and the terrorists take you prisoner ...
1305	1308	well you will probably want to take your own life.
1308	1312	Here you better have this.
1316	1319	All right team! That's it! We've got a job to do.
1319	1322	Let's go police the World!
1322	1329	# America~America~ #
1329	1331	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1331	1334	# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #
1334	1337	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1337	1340	# Freedom is the only way yeah! #
1340	1342	# Terrorists your game is through~ #
1342	1345	# 'cause now you have to answer to~ #
1345	1348	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1348	1351	# So lick my butt and suck on my balls~ #
1351	1353	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1356	1358	What if the old man is wrong about him, uh?
1358	1362	What if he is not the actor Spottswoode says he is?
1363	1366	Why don't you trust actors Chris?
1367	1371	I got my reasons.
1373	1376	You're all right Gary?
1376	1377	I was just thinking...
1377	1380	on stage if I mess up a line it could mean a bad review.
1381	1385	If I mess up here...we're all dead.
1386	1389	I believe you can do this Gary
1389	1390	Why?
1390	1393	What reason do you have to believe?
1393	1397	Sometimes ... believing is all we have.
1449	1452	Fear not Muslim friends! We are here to find terrorists...
1452	1456	I am clearing your minds of all anxiety.
1456	1457	All right, good job Sarah.
1457	1459	Now everyone make for the tavern.
1460	1462	Let's get one thing straight actor - I don't trust you.
1462	1464	And if you betray us I'll rip your fucking balls off
1464	1466	and stuff them up your ass, so the next time you shit...
1466	1468	you'll shit all over your balls. Got it?
1468	1470	What's your problem with me?
1470	1471	Yeah, you want a go?
1471	1472	Guys, guys, guys!
1472	1475	Don't you see this is just what the terrorists want us to do?
1475	1479	The war is out there man - out there. Now pull it together!
1481	1485	All right team, let's move to the inner city. Keep it quiet!
1496	1498	Clear, Clear, Clear, Clear
1498	1499	All right Gary, you follow me!
1499	1501	The rest of the team takes super secret hiding positions alpha one.
1504	1507	All right that's the tavern with the blue door.
1507	1511	Act your way past those guards! Dee what you can find out!
1512	1514	Temember if you think they are onto you give us the signal.
1514	1518	You remember the signal?
1518	1519	That's right.
1519	1523	All right, good luck.
1523	1527	Go get 'em cowboy!
1556	1557	Oh shit!
1557	1561	Come on Gary act. You have the power.
1578	1579	All right Gary.
1579	1580	Told you he was top gun.
1580	1582	I've never seen acting that good.
1582	1586	He's amazing.
1605	1608	We are Bashi rebels from the country of Somalia.
1608	1609	Who are you?
1611	1613	My...name is Hakmed.
1613	1615	I am a terrorist.
1617	1621	Anybody know of any terrorist attacks coming up soon?
1633	1637	I sense that I am becoming attracted to Gary.
1638	1640	My advise is not to get involved with the team members, Sarah.
1640	1643	It's to painful to see them die.
1644	1646	I am sorry Lisa I didn't mean to bring out...
1646	1648	It's ok Sarah.
1648	1650	I treasure your friendship.
1650	1654	I treasure yours Lisa.
1658	1662	Hey have you ever thought of telling Sarah how you feel?
1662	1665	Ah, what would a girl like Sarah want with a...
1665	1667	simple Nebraska Boy like me?
1667	1671	I don't know nothing about fancy cars and fancy restaurants.
1671	1675	Still I'd love to show her a full moon night on the corn fields.
1689	1691	What do you know?
1691	1694	I heard there may be a large terrorist attack.
1694	1698	If you tell me what it is maybe I can help out.
1698	1699	Get out of here!
1699	1701	We have put a jihad on the infidels
1701	1704	because they destroy our lives.
1705	1708	What do you know about pain and sadness?
1710	1716	Gary, Gary, Gary!
1718	1721	I was just a boy when the infidels came to my village
1721	1723	in their black hawk hellicopters.
1725	1726	The infidels fired at the oil fields and
1726	1729	they lid up like the eyes of Allah.
1729	1731	Burning oil rain down from the sky
1731	1732	cooked everything it touched.
1732	1734	I could only hide myself and cry...
1734	1738	as my goats were consumed by fiery black liquid death.
1740	1742	In the midst of the chaos...
1742	1746	I could swear that I heard my goats ... screaming for help.
1748	1752	As quickly as they'd come the infidels were gone.
1752	1756	It was on that day I put a jihad on them.
1759	1760	And if you don't believe it
1760	1762	then you better kill me now.
1762	1766	Because I'ill put a jihad on you too.
1772	1776	I like you. You have balls. I like balls
1779	1780	All right, listen carefully!
1780	1783	The WMDs are located in a secret bunker
1783	1785	20 yards east of this building.
1785	1786	You can help us by grabbing it...
1791	1793	Come! They're onto us.
1793	1797	Hurry friend! We must make our escape.
1799	1802	Shit! I've got 5 terrorists going southeast on Bacalacadaca street.
1802	1804	Don't let them get away!
1809	1812	I sense that Gary is trapped inside the tavern.
1812	1816	Copy Sarah. You get Gary and we'll go after the terrorists.
1816	1818	# America~ #
1818	1821	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1821	1824	# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #
1824	1827	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
1827	1830	# Freedom is the only way yeah! #
1831	1833	# It's the dream that we all share #
1833	1838	# -It's the hope for tomorrow~ # # - Fuck Yeah! #
1843	1846	Die infidels!
1853	1854	They're not stopping.
1854	1856	They had their chance.
1864	1868	Missed wide right.
1868	1870	One of the terrorist is trying to tell us something.
1870	1872	It's me, it's me.
1872	1876	Looks like he is saying "kiss me, kiss me".
1876	1880	Smartass motherfucker
1891	1892	Gary?
1892	1894	An infidel.
1894	1897	Get up!
1905	1909	Gary?
1910	1912	Sarah to Team America 4
1912	1913	What you got Sarah?
1913	1915	Gary isn't in the tavern.
1915	1917	I think he maybe...with....terror....
1917	1918	Say again Sarah. You're breaking up.
1918	1920	Joe do you copy?
1920	1922	I'll get him.
1922	1924	Lisa?
1927	1928	I lost her.
1928	1930	It's all right. We'll kill these guys
1930	1931	and we'll find out what she wants.
1932	1936	All right.
1940	1942	Hey, hey guys I think we should pull over.
1942	1943	Pull over?
1943	1944	Yes of course!
1944	1945	Pull over let them pass us ...
1945	1947	and when they turn around we charge them.
1947	1951	I love your balls.
1952	1953	Shit they got by me.
1957	1958	What are we doing?
1958	1960	This jeep is filled with explosives.
1960	1963	We're going take their lives and our own.
1963	1965	We...we gonna what?
1965	1966	Hang on Joe!
1966	1970	Die infidels!
1979	1983	Suprise cockheads!
1984	1988	Ahh!
1997	2001	All right we fucking did it.
2003	2004	Spottswoode, this is Lisa.
2004	2008	Gary found the WMDs and the terrorists are down.
2008	2012	Great job team. Head back to base for deep briefing and cocktails.
2016	2019	This is breaking news with Peter Jennings.
2020	2022	Team America has once again pissed off
2022	2024	the entire world after blowing up half of Cairo.
2025	2028	And now some Hollywood celebrities are lashing out.
2028	2031	Alec Baldwin is head of the Film Actors Guild.
2032	2033	The Film Actors Guild believes that
2033	2036	what the world needs is compassion not violence.
2036	2040	All that Team America does is create new enemies.
2040	2042	Let me explain to you how this works.
2042	2045	You see the corporations finance Team America ...
2045	2047	and then Team America goes out...
2047	2049	and the Corporations sit there in their...
2049	2051	in their corporation buildings
2051	2053	and ... and see that they are all corporationy
2053	2055	and they make money.
2056	2058	Last year I went to Iraq.
2058	2060	Before Team America showed up it was a happy place.
2061	2063	They had flowery metals and rainbow skies...
2063	2065	and rivers made of chcolates where the children
2065	2068	danced and laughed and played with gun drop smiles.
2069	2070	The actors are calling for an emergency meeting.
2070	2072	All ready excepted to attend are:
2072	2073	Helen Hunt
2073	2074	George Clooney
2074	2075	Liv Tyler
2075	2077	Martin Sheen
2077	2078	Susan Sarandon
2078	2079	Janeane Garofalo
2079	2080	and Matt Damon
2080	2083	Matt Damon
2083	2084	In the mean time
2084	2086	the world wants to deal with dangerous individuals...
2086	2088	their own way.
2105	2109	Hans Blix. Oh no!
2109	2112	Oh hello. Great to see you again Hans.
2112	2116	Mr. ll, I was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today
2116	2119	and you guards won't let me into certain areas.
2119	2120	Hans, Hans, Hans!
2120	2122	We being through this a dozen times!
2122	2126	I don't have any weapons mass destruction, ok Hans?
2126	2127	Then let me look around
2127	2129	so I can ease U.N.'s collective mind.
2130	2132	Hans, you are breaking my balls here, Hans...
2132	2133	you are breaking my balls!
2133	2135	I am sorry but the U.N. must be firm with you!
2135	2139	Let me see your whole palace or else ...
2139	2141	Or else what?
2141	2145	Or else we will be very, very angry with you.
2145	2149	And we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.
2150	2155	Ok! I will show you Hans, you ready? Stand a little to your left.
2157	2158	Little more...
2160	2160	Good!
2167	2168	There you go Hans Blix!
2168	2170	How you like that you fucking cock sucker?
2173	2177	You have any idea how fucking busy I am Hans Blix?
2177	2178	Well, fuck you!
2178	2180	You are inspecting? Well inspect that!
2180	2182	You buttfucking piece of shit.
2183	2185	What? You think I am just a petty arms dealer?
2185	2187	I am planning the attack!
2187	2189	Congratulations Team America!
2189	2191	You have stopped nothing!
2210	2213	Congratulations Gary. You've done an amazing thing.
2213	2215	It will be years before the terrorists
2215	2217	have the resources to attack again!
2217	2220	We are going to be unstoppable with you on the team Gary.
2220	2223	Terrorist your game is through.
2223	2225	You're the best, Gary.
2226	2229	When this terrorist shoots at us from the back of his jeep and...
2229	2231	You might have all the others fooled but not me.
2231	2234	Your acting was reckless and it put us all in danger.
2234	2236	The next time you put a stun like that...
2236	2237	I'll drill two holes for your dick.
2237	2238	So that when you pee
2238	2240	it will shoot out in all directions.
2240	2241	You got it?!
2243	2245	Hey Sarah do you mind if I dance with you?
2245	2249	No of course not Joe.
2256	2260	Joe do you think it's ok for team members to date?
2261	2263	Sarah really?
2263	2265	Yeah do you think it's all right?
2265	2266	I think it's better than all right.
2266	2270	- It's great. - Oh good. I'm so glad you think so.
2283	2285	Gary, you're ok?
2286	2290	I was just wondering if I can let go of an old painful memory.
2292	2295	Is it anything you want to talk about?
2295	2299	When I was a kid I always looked up to my older brother Tommy.
2299	2302	He was the jock and I was the little performer.
2303	2304	We were all at the zoo one day.
2304	2307	I was doing some acting...
2307	2309	walking on the railing of the gorilla exhibit.
2309	2311	I fell in.
2311	2314	Everyone screamed and Tommy jumped in after me
2315	2317	forgetting that he had blueberries in his front pocket.
2319	2320	The gorillas just went wild.
2321	2323	They jumped all over his body...
2323	2326	and threw him around like a rag doll to get to those blueberries.
2327	2328	One gorilla would throw him to another gorilla
2328	2331	who would toss him to another.
2333	2335	Everyone panicked and cried out for somebody to help - but...
2335	2337	it was too late...
2337	2339	The gorillas beat him to death
2339	2342	before the zoo keepers could gas them all.
2345	2348	My acting got my brother killed.
2348	2353	I had to live with that every single day.
2353	2357	Gary you can't blame yourself for what the gorillas did.
2357	2360	I think I can finally let it go,
2360	2363	because...my acting saved the entire world.
2363	2365	And something even better happened.
2365	2367	What?
2367	2371	I met somebody who ... took my breath away.
2376	2379	Gary, no!
2379	2380	I am sorry.
2380	2383	It's just ... things are really complicated Gary.
2384	2386	I know about Carson.
2386	2388	I know how it feels.
2388	2390	God I am so confused.
2390	2394	It's too soon to be having feelings for you.
2394	2399	Maybe feelings are feelings because we can't control them.
2399	2400	But I have to control them
2400	2403	because I can't go through losing somebody again. It's too painful!
2404	2406	So...so what? You're just gonna shut down?
2406	2410	I really like you - there's no chance we can ever be togther?
2413	2416	Only if you could promise me you'll never die.
2416	2418	You know I can't promise you that.
2418	2422	If you did that I would make love to you right now.
2426	2430	I promise. I will never die.
2447	2451	# I need this, I need love, I need you~ #
2454	2458	# I don't need one heartbeat, I need two~ #
2460	2463	# There is an emptiness I need to fill~ #
2463	2467	# And only one emptiness will do~ #
2467	2470	# Only a woman~ #
2470	2474	# Can brighten up my day~ #
2474	2476	# Only a woman~ #
2476	2480	# Can touch me the right way~ #
2480	2483	# Only a woman~ #
2483	2487	# Is allowed to touch me there~ #
2487	2491	# All I ask is that you're a woman~ #
2492	2495	Lisa you are the most amazing person I've ever met.
2495	2496	It's only being a short time...
2496	2498	but I think that I am completely in love...
2498	2499	shhh
2499	2502	Let's not talk.
2502	2505	I can't help it. It just feels so right.
2505	2506	I don't want anything to mess it up.
2506	2509	shhh
2509	2513	There is not a thing in the world that can mess this up.
2617	2620	Team I'm afraid I have bad news.
2620	2624	At 7:15 this morning the terrorists carried out their attack.
2625	2626	What?
2626	2630	But how can that be? Gary stopped the terrorists in Cairo.
2630	2632	It appears now that Intelligence was wrong about
2632	2634	the Chechenens being in charge.
2635	2638	That was bad intelligence. Very bad intelligence!
2638	2640	I am sorry.
2640	2644	We have to find out who did this and take them down ... Fast.
2645	2648	Sir I'm intercepting communications about the terrorist identities.
2648	2650	On screen!
2651	2654	This is breaking news with Peter Jennings.
2654	2657	An attack in Panama today has left thousands dead.
2657	2661	Taking credit were terrorists from Derkaderkastain.
2661	2664	Of course Derkaderkastain.
2664	2665	The terrorists claim that the attack was
2665	2668	retaliation for Team America's action in Cairo.
2668	2672	Alec Baldwin is rallying all the members of the Film Actors Guild.
2672	2674	Alec Baldwin!
2674	2674	Gary?
2674	2678	He is ... he is my hero! The single greatest actor of all time.
2679	2682	Who is to blame for these attack at Panama?
2682	2686	The terrorists? The person who supplied them with the WMDs?
2686	2690	No! Blame Team America!
2691	2693	their reckless disregard in Cairo...
2693	2695	brought on this violence today!
2695	2695	Team America ...
2695	2699	the blood of the victims of Panama is on your hands.
2703	2704	Moved by Alec Baldwin's impassionate speech
2704	2710	hundreds of people turned out at Mountain Rushmore today to protest.
2712	2714	Hey that's here.
2714	2716	Tom! It looks like filmmaker Michael Moore
2716	2719	is also jumping on the fuck Team America bandwagon!
2721	2722	Protesting is not enough!
2722	2727	We must take radical action against the fascists in our own country!
2727	2730	Bring it down, bring it all down!
2735	2738	Team, if the Dekaderkastanies have weapons of mass destruction
2738	2742	I am afraid it could be 911 times a thousand.
2742	2744	Jesus you mean ...
2744	2747	Yes! 911,000.
2748	2750	Then forget all this assholes. We got work to do.
2750	2753	Yes let's get Gary valmorphinized so we can use his acting.
2753	2758	My acting? My acting! My acting just got a thousand people killed!
2758	2760	Jesus I've done it again.
2760	2763	Pull yourself together Gary. We need you now more than ever.
2763	2765	I'm through with this.
2765	2766	Gary you can't go.
2766	2767	Without you the team is doomed!
2767	2770	Remember there is no "I" in Team America.
2771	2773	Yes there is.
2775	2777	I know it's hard Gary...
2777	2780	but you are still the only hope to stop these newer terrorists.
2780	2783	Why me? Why am I the only one?
2783	2785	Because you are the one with the power to do so.
2785	2787	But I don't want the fucking power.
2789	2790	I don't want the guilt!
2790	2791	I don't want the shame and...
2791	2793	I don't want the responsibility!
2794	2796	Then what about all the things you promised last night?
2796	2798	You said you'd never leave!
2799	2803	I said I'd never die, but now I'm dead inside.
2804	2808	You slept with Gary?
2808	2810	Sarah ...
2810	2813	But you knew I liked Gary. I told you.
2814	2817	You like Gary? Oh, I see...
2819	2821	I didn't plan on it happening Sarah.
2821	2824	Save it Lisa.
2824	2827	You see all I do is hurt people.
2827	2828	Gary you didn't kill your brother!
2828	2831	Those gorillas did!
2834	2837	I'm sorry I'm not the man you think I am.
2837	2839	I'm just bad news.
2840	2843	I'ill never act again.
2850	2852	Fuck him! We don't need an actor.
2852	2855	We can take out the Derkaderkastainies the old fashion way.
2855	2857	No! It will be a suicide mission.
2857	2858	That's all right...
2858	2862	I feel a little bit like dying.
2864	2868	God damn it Gary.
2871	2876	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
2876	2882	# Coming again to save the mother fucking day yeah~ #
2882	2887	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
2887	2893	# Freedom is the only way yeah! #
2893	2898	# Terrorists your game is through~ #
2898	2903	# 'cause now you have to answer to~ #
2904	2909	# -America # # -Fuck Yeah! #
2909	2914	# -America # # -Fuck... #
2914	2919	Gary! Help me! Get this thing off me! Gary!
2921	2924	All right team we are near Derkaderkastain!
2925	2926	Let's get ready!
2927	2930	Look out! We got terrorist aircraft.
2936	2938	There is only 5 of them, team. This should be easy.
2938	2941	Korean aircraft at 1:00 o'clock.
2941	2945	What are they doing here?
2947	2950	Shoot them down - like dogs.
2950	2954	Kim Jong-Il ... why is he helping terrorists?
2960	2962	I've got one on my tail.
2963	2965	I got you Sarah!
2969	2971	Bring in the submarines!
2973	2975	What the hell?
2975	2977	Somebody is shooting at us from the water!
2977	2979	It must be a Korean sub.
2979	2980	Chris you get to take him out.
2980	2982	I am already on it.
2988	2990	These guys really snuck up on us.
2990	2992	Yeah there is a lot of that going around lately.
2993	2995	Sarah you know I didn't mean to hurt you.
2995	2999	No you just didn't care if you did.
2999	3000	Now come on Sarah that isn't fair!
3001	3003	Lisa can't help it if Gary has feelings for her.
3004	3007	Just like nobody can help it if you have feelings for Gary.
3011	3013	What is that supposed to mean?
3013	3014	Oh come on Sarah!
3014	3016	You mean you never realized that Joe has feelings for you?
3020	3022	Joe? But you're like a brother to me.
3023	3026	That's all I ever am ... like a brother.
3026	3029	It isn't fair.
3033	3035	Hang on team. Someone has broken into the hangar.
3035	3036	Baxter?
3036	3038	Hey Team America.
3038	3040	I got something for you!
3040	3042	What the hell?
3042	3044	Prepare to die!
3046	3054	Jesus titty fucking Christ!
3055	3058	Spottswoode!
3058	3059	Oh my god!
3060	3061	No ...
3062	3063	he can't be dead.
3064	3066	We've lost Intelligence.
3066	3069	I repeat ... we have no Intelligence.
3069	3070	Their computers are down.
3070	3074	Attack!
3075	3076	Sarah!
3076	3080	That's it I am going down.
3080	3082	Sarah God! Chris you gotta help her!
3082	3083	I am on it.
3083	3085	Just hang on Sarah!
3087	3090	Oh fuck, I've been hit.
3090	3092	Chris, come in!
3092	3094	Oh Jesus I am hit.
3093	3094	Lisa!
3094	3095	It's going down!
3095	3097	God damn it. I am gonna to have to breach.
3100	3103	I am going to hit the water.
3103	3105	Missile lock - I got missile lock!
3105	3107	I gotta bail out!
3107	3111	Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
3123	3124	Salvage that ships!
3124	3128	- If you find anyone alive...you know what to do with them. - Yeah! 699
3284	3287	Terrorist on screen.
3133	3137	Ok, who blew up Panama Canal?
3137	3139	We were angry about Cairo.
3139	3141	God damn it how many times do I have to tell you.
3141	3144	you don't use the WMDs until you see the signal.
3144	3146	I've woked 10 years on this plan.
3146	3149	And it's a very precise and a complicated plan.
3149	3151	I am sick of you terrorist fucking it up.
3151	3153	Now take the weapons where I told you...
3153	3155	and wait for the God damn signal this time!
3155	3157	Good bye!
3158	3162	Why is everyone so fucking stupid?
3162	3166	Why aren't there more people intelligent like me?
3167	3169	I am ... so ...
3169	3171	# lonely~ #
3171	3173	# so lonely~ #
3173	3177	# so lonely and sadly alone~ #
3177	3181	# get no one, just me only~ #
3181	3185	# sitting on my little throne~ #
3185	3189	# I work very hard and make out great plans~ #
3189	3194	# but nobody listens no one understands~ #
3194	3200	# seems like no one takes me seriously~ #
3200	3204	# and so...I'm lonely~ #
3204	3207	# eheh, a little lonely ... #
3208	3213	# poor little me~ #
3217	3221	# there's no body, I can relate to~ #
3221	3225	# feel like a bird in the cage~ #
3225	3229	# it's kind of silly, but not reary~ #
3229	3233	# because it's filling my body with rage~ #
3233	3237	# I'm the smartest, most clever and most physically fit!~ #
3237	3241	# but no body else seems to realize it~ #
3241	3248	# when I changed the world maybe they'll notice me~ #
3248	3249	# and until then #
3249	3252	# I'll just be lonely~ #
3253	3256	# yeah...a little lonely #
3256	3262	# poor little me~ #
3265	3273	# I'm...so ... lonely~ #
3287	3288	# what would you do~ #
3288	3293	# if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom~ #
3294	3297	# what would you do,If asked to make the ultimate sacrifice~ #
3298	3300	Hey weren't you the actor in that Broadway show?
3300	3304	Hey yeah it is you do that scene where everyone gets AIDS.
3305	3308	I don't act anymore. I gave that up.
3308	3309	Oh come on man. Just a scene.
3309	3315	I said get away from me. I am completely lost. I've hit rock bottom.
3315	3318	Easy, easy ho. You gotta calm down there Chuck.
3318	3321	I hurt people. I am a dick.
3322	3324	Oh, being a dick isn't so bad.
3324	3328	There are three kinds of people. Dicks, pussies, and assholes.
3329	3330	Pussies think everyone can get alone.
3330	3333	And dicks just want to fuck all the time without thinking it through.
3334	3336	But then you get your assholes Chuck!
3336	3339	And all the assholes want is to shit all over everything.
3340	3342	So pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while
3342	3345	because pussies get fucked by dicks.
3345	3349	But dicks also fuck assholes, Chuck.
3349	3351	And if they didn't fuck the assholes you know what you get?
3351	3355	You get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit.
3356	3360	All right that does it. Get out of here you drunk low life!
3366	3370	Get out of here I said!
3376	3383	Lisa! Lisa? Lisa are you here?
3384	3386	Get out of the street you fuking bum!
3392	3394	You gave up on life didn't you?
3474	3475	My fellow actors!
3475	3477	We live in a dark time.
3477	3480	The world is becoming more and more violent
3480	3482	and the idoits in charge are making it worse.
3482	3486	What the world needs is an international advisory committee
3486	3489	who truly understands global politics.
3489	3493	- Namely ... us. - erg!erg!erg!
3494	3497	The time has come for us to start using our acting talents in a different way.
3498	3501	Yes we can use our powers to change the world.
3501	3504	erg!erg!erg!
3504	3507	We'll persuvade everyone to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking.
3507	3510	If we focus our acting on global politics
3510	3512	we can change everything and stuff!
3512	3515	erg!erg!erg!
3515	3519	As actors it's our responsibility to read the newspapers
3519	3523	and then say what we read on television like it's our own opinion.
3524	3525	Matt Damon
3526	3527	We'll all done action films.
3527	3529	If anyone tries to get in our way
3529	3531	we'll show them how tough we actors really are.
3531	3536	erg!erg!erg!
3536	3538	I am glad you all agree
3538	3542	because I've just been contacted by a very important political leader
3542	3544	who has bringing all the world leaders together
3544	3547	for a massive international peace conference
3547	3551	and he wants us to be the keynote speakers.
3551	3554	erg!erg!erg!
3554	3556	Matt Damon!
3556	3557	erg!erg!erg!
3557	3560	Say hello to our new partner!
3560	3563	Hello?
3563	3566	erg!erg!erg!
3571	3575	Stop it! Stop it! You are killing him.
3575	3577	I am gonna fucking kill you.
3577	3580	You are not in the position to kill anyone,
3580	3582	my red, white and blue friend.
3583	3587	So you are the bastard planning 911 times a thousand.
3587	3589	No, you think so small.
3589	3593	You see, I am about to have an elaborate peace ceremony!
3593	3597	And while all the world's most important peoples are distracted here
3597	3600	I will detonate the WMDs
3600	3604	which I have given to terrorists all around the globe.
3605	3609	It will be 911 times 2356.
3611	3615	My god! That's...I don't even know what that is.
3615	3617	Nobody does.
3617	3619	You heartless bastard!
3619	3620	Why would you do such a thing.
3620	3622	Because then I will be balance!
3622	3625	Every country will be a Third World country!
3625	3629	Just imagine it. All around the world there will be massive explosions.
3631	3634	With nobody to guide them the people will break out into panic and
3634	3639	rioting all over the earth the true nature of humanity is unleashed.
3639	3644	Dog eats dog as everyone attacks everyone and feds only for themselves.
3644	3647	Global stability unravels.
3647	3651	By the time my show is over it will be far too late.
3658	3659	Your plan will fail!
3659	3663	You will never keep the world leaders distracted here for 9 hours!
3663	3664	Oh no?
3664	3668	I've got Alec Baldwin.
3668	3670	Damn god!
3670	3673	You are the rest of a dying breed ...
3673	3675	the flag waving Americans.
3675	3679	Well your little dream will soon be over.
3679	3682	I must get back planning the ceremony now.
3682	3684	The film actors are on their way.
3684	3687	Perhaps they'll stop in and say hello!
3689	3694	Having so little faith in humanity must make you a very lonely man.
3701	3704	You shall have a front row seat.
3704	3706	Bring her upstairs!
3706	3708	Leave her alone you son of a bitch!
3708	3712	Lisa, I treasure your friendship.
3713	3716	Ah! Somebody has to stop this.
3722	3726	# I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark #
3726	3730	# When he made Pearl Harbor #
3730	3734	# I miss you more than that movie missed the point #
3734	3738	# And that's an awful lot girl, and now~ #
3738	3741	# now you've gone away~ #
3742	3745	# All I'm trying to say~ #
3745	3747	# is Pearl Harbor sucked #
3747	3751	# and I missed you~ #
3754	3758	# I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school~ #
3758	3761	# He was terrible in that film! #
3761	3766	# I need you like Cuba Gooding needed a bigger part~ #
3766	3770	# He's way better than Ben Affleck and now~ #
3770	3773	# all I can think about is your smiles~ #
3773	3776	# and that shitty movie too~ #
3776	3779	# Pearl Harbour sucked~ #
3779	3783	# and I miss you~ #
3785	3788	# Pearl Harbour sucked~ #
3790	3795	# just a little bit more than I miss you~ #
3796	3800	Oh my god! What the hell happened?
3817	3821	Hello anybody?
3822	3825	Greetings Mr. Johnston.
3825	3827	Intelligence what the hell happened?
3827	3831	Our base was attacked by a giant socialist weasel.
3831	3833	But where is the team?
3833	3837	They have been taken prisoner by Kim Jong-Il in North Korea.
3837	3839	I have intercepted communications that...
3839	3843	he is planning the massive attack during a peace ceremony.
3843	3846	Don't move protestor or I will blow your commy brains out.
3846	3848	Spottswoode?
3848	3849	Johnston?
3850	3851	What the hell are you doing here?
3851	3852	Get away from Intelligence!
3852	3855	I am using it to blow up North Korea.
3855	3857	No! The team is in North Korea.
3857	3861	I know and so are the triggers to WMDs poised all around the globle
3861	3864	My only opinion now is to blow up Kim Jong-Il...
3864	3866	and everything around him before he can set them off.
3866	3869	Intelligence, initiate detonation sequences on the ships.
3869	3870	You'll kill them all!
3871	3873	It's what they would want me to do Gary!
3873	3874	They would happily give their lives...
3874	3876	for the good of the world - something you don't understand.
3877	3878	There has to be another way.
3878	3881	There is nobody left to stop Kim Jong-Il.
3882	3883	Let me go!
3884	3887	You? You are a butt fucking quitter!
3887	3889	You walked out Gary.
3889	3890	The team went on a mission without you and...
3890	3892	without an actor they were like pigs to the slaughter.
3892	3895	I am suppose to leave the fate of the world in your hands?
3895	3897	I know I walked out but I'd do anything to take it back!
3897	3899	Please just let me help!
3899	3900	You've done enough
3901	3903	Please! Spottswoode you have to believe in me!
3906	3908	I want to believe in you Gary.
3908	3910	I really do.
3910	3913	But you've let me down before.
3913	3917	Please! How can I make you trust me?
3917	3920	I remembered the first time we met.
3920	3922	You were a simple Broadway actor afraid to get in my limo
3922	3926	because you thought I wanted you to perform oral sex on me.
3926	3928	Do you remember that?
3928	3930	Yeah
3930	3932	But now the tables are turned
3932	3935	and I don't know if I can trust you.
3937	3940	Just give me a chance.
3943	3946	Alright! I will trust you...
3946	3951	but only if you will perform oral sex on me.
3952	3953	What?
3953	3957	Right here, right now.
3958	3959	You can't be serious.
3959	3961	Oh I am serious.
3961	3965	Look, this is my serious face.
3966	3967	What will that prove?
3967	3970	It will prove that you are truly ready to lay everything on the line
3970	3972	To throw away all you innervations and get 100 percent
3972	3974	We must go back to the first night we met
3974	3976	that first issue of trust. Don't you see?
3976	3978	No, I thought you weren't gay.
3978	3980	This isn't about sex Gary ... it's about trust!
3980	3982	It is the eye of the needle Gary!
3982	3983	And we must both pass through it.
3988	3992	Ok, let's do it.
3992	3994	Ah, make sure nobody is watching.
3995	3996	Yeah, looks clear.
3997	3999	Ok, go!
4000	4002	There must be another way
4002	4004	Huh, I guess you won't do everything ...
4004	4005	to take it all back, will you Gary?
4005	4008	No, no, no ... wait ... hold on!
4008	4012	You are saying if I do that you'll let me help the team?
4013	4017	I will give you all the time I can!
4018	4021	Ok, let's do it!
4021	4023	Here we go.
4023	4027	And go!
4052	4056	You are dedicated. Now let's go get cleaned up!
4056	4059	If you are going to storm Kim Jong-Il's palace single-handed...
4059	4062	we have to make you a complete solider in very little time.
4063	4064	How we gonna do that?
4065	4069	I think I know just what we need.

4201	4204	10 years of planning and finally the night is here.
4204	4206	The terrorists know to be in position...
4206	4208	by the time Alec Baldwin takes the stage.
4208	4212	That's when I trigger all the WMDs to go up at the same time.
4212	4214	When you see Alec Baldwin...
4214	4218	You will see the true ugliness of human nature.
4219	4222	Your plan will never work. Something will stop it.
4223	4226	You stupid naive team Americans ...
4226	4228	You believe in true ravin happy endings...
4228	4231	even while the world around you spirals downward!
4231	4236	Sometimes believing is all we have.
4237	4239	And as the leaders of your countries ...

4263	4264	I am with the Film Actors Guild
4264	4266	here to help the broadcast
4266	4268	Then you show credentials?
4268	4270	Hey! You don't need to see my credentials.
4270	4272	I left them at home and I am running late.
4273	4274	I believe him.
4274	4275	Yeah, me too!
4275	4277	Ok let him go.
4278	4281	My god, his acting is better than ever.
4295	4299	Don't worry fellas, I've got my pass right here!
4308	4310	Please Mr. Sheen and Mr. Robbins ...
4310	4312	you don't understand what Kim Jong-Il is doing!
4312	4316	Shut up we have explicit instructions to watch you.
4316	4318	Yeah! we are supposed to be guards.
4318	4319	We are guards.
4319	4321	Guards, we are guards.
4321	4322	We are guards.
4322	4326	Mr. Sheen, Mr. Robbins! Someone has broken into the main hall.
4326	4326	What?
4326	4330	Come on Martin!
4338	4339	Gary?
4339	4341	What the fuck are you doing here?
4341	4342	Guys, you're all right?
4342	4344	Where is Lisa?
4344	4346	What the heck do you care? You walked out on her.
4346	4347	Look, I wanna make things right.
4347	4349	Here, Spottswoode's monitoring from the base.
4349	4351	Spottswoode is dead Gary.
4351	4352	Not as dead as you think.
4352	4353	Spottswoode
4353	4356	Yes I am here, Joe.
4356	4357	All right you are alive.
4357	4359	Great to hear your voices again.
4359	4362	Now we've got to get Lisa and stop Kim Jong-Il.
4362	4364	I am not going anywhere with this fucking traitor.
4364	4366	Yeah! What makes you think we'll take your backing? Douchebag?
4366	4367	We are doing this without you.
4367	4369	Now hold on team!
4369	4372	Gary has already proven to me that he is 100% committed to the team.
4372	4375	He proved it last night by sucking my cock.
4379	4383	All right...come on team we got to find that stage!
4383	4385	Look how much they love my show!
4385	4388	The entire audience is so captivated!
4394	4398	Now you see the new world is inevitable.
4398	4400	It's what?
4400	4402	Inev...inevitable...
4402	4403	One more time?
4403	4404	Inevitable!
4404	4406	Things are inevitably going to change!
4406	4409	God damn it! Open your fucking ears!
4411	4412	5 minutes Mr. Baldwin.
4412	4413	Thank you!
4413	4415	Alec! We have a problem!
4415	4417	Team America escaped.
4418	4418	What?
4418	4421	You fools they'll ruin everything
4421	4423	We better warn everyone they will be headed here.
4423	4426	No! We can't look weak and powerless!
4426	4429	If violence is all those bastards understand then violence they'll get.
4429	4431	Every actor grab a gun and keep Team America...
4431	4434	from reaching this ceremony at all costs!
4439	4442	I swear they won't reach the stage.
4459	4459	Jesus!
4460	4460	What have we got?
4461	4463	Looks like George Clooney and Liv Tyler, 20 yards.
4465	4467	Look out, Ethan Hawke and Janeane Garofalo.
4473	4474	Drop your weapon!
4475	4476	Fucking die!
4479	4480	Got to split up!
4480	4481	Sarah you and Gary go that way!
4481	4482	Chris and I will go right.
4482	4486	No I think I'd rather team up with you Joe.
4487	4489	I guess you are with me cock fag.
4491	4492	Danny Glover
4492	4494	Come on Penn we must protect the show!
4494	4495	Right!
4496	4497	The stage must be that way-
4497	4501	No Joe, Sarah it's a trap!
4505	4507	Very impressive war mongers.
4507	4511	Now let's see how Kim Jong-Il's panthers treat you.
4514	4518	I went to Iraq you know?
4522	4523	Susan Sarandon
4523	4526	Oh thank god. We have to stop the ceremony!
4526	4527	Kim Jong-Il is mad!
4527	4529	Here let me loose. I will show you where the theater is!
4529	4530	All right!
4530	4532	No! Chris stay away from her!
4532	4532	Fuck you!
4532	4533	She wants to help us.
4533	4535	No Chris.
4535	4536	She is acting.
4536	4538	I am not.
4538	4541	The others tied me up because I won't go along with their plans!
4541	4543	Your skills are fading with age, Miss Sarandon.
4545	4549	You shall die a peasant's death!
4557	4559	Jesus titty fucking Christ!
4559	4561	I could have sworn she was telling the truth!
4561	4562	That's why they call it acting.
4562	4565	Come on, we gotta find Lisa.
4565	4569	I was 19 year old when the musical Cats came to our town.
4569	4572	I couldn't wait to see it.
4572	4574	After the show I was asked if I wanted to go meet...
4574	4576	some of the performers backstage.
4576	4578	Man I was thrilled.
4578	4579	But when I get back there ...
4579	4582	they were drunk and out of control.
4582	4586	Rumpus Cat and Macavity kept feeling up my leg.
4586	4589	I tried to leave but Rumpleteaser held me down and...
4591	4595	I was raped by Mr.Mistoffeles.
4597	4601	That's why you don't trust actors.
4603	4605	I am sorry I've been so hard on you.
4605	4607	If there is still a world left after this is all over
4607	4610	I'd like to buy you are a beer.
4613	4616	Come on let's go! We are running out of time.
4619	4623	Sarah, before we die I want to finally tell you that I love you.
4624	4628	No no I am not going to let it end like this!
4628	4632	We are not your enemy, furry ones. You will not attack us.
4632	4633	Sarah, that isn't going to work.
4633	4636	You don't really have mental powers.
4636	4638	Your captors are behind you Shibas.
4638	4640	Show your anger to them.
4652	4654	Oh no.
4654	4657	No, no.
4660	4664	Sarah you did it.
4665	4667	Wait! Hold on!
4667	4670	Spottswoode, I think we just found the entrance to the theater.
4670	4671	Have Sarah and Joe lock on...Oh!
4673	4673	Gary
4673	4675	Huh, I guess you won't do everything ...
4675	4676	Actors, halt!
4676	4678	Helen Hunt
4678	4679	Samuel L. Jackson
4679	4682	Matt Damon
4683	4684	Motherfucker!
4686	4688	Gary, Chris, come in!
4690	4695	And now Ladies and Gentlemen ... Mr. Alec Baldwin.
4706	4709	We are here to usher in a new era without violence.
4709	4711	By following the rules of the Film Actors Guild
4711	4714	the world can become a better place
4714	4718	that handles dangerous people with talk and reasoning
4718	4721	That is the FAG way.
4721	4726	One day you will look at the world that us actors created and say:
4726	4732	"Wa, good going FAG! You really made the world a better place.
4732	4733	Didn't you FAG?
4733	4735	Yeah, Alec Baldwin.
4735	4738	Too bad there won't be a world left.
4738	4740	Oh god, no!
4740	4744	You see, no prince charming rode in on a white stallion to save the day.
4745	4746	This is the real world.
4747	4751	I am afraid your world is over ...
4751	4753	In 5 minutes!
4756	4758	Yes the ticking clock.
4760	4765	Sorry Team America but you see ... we must live in a time of peace.
4765	4767	Put down the gas can now!
4768	4769	Kill them!
4773	4775	Jackson
4777	4781	Team, you've got to hurry.
4785	4787	Let's go bitch! I've done action films.
4787	4791	Come on!
4810	4812	Matt Damon
4822	4825	Come on! Stop trying to hit me and hit me!
4831	4833	Don't fucking move!
4833	4837	Now isn't that a shame? You came so close to stopping peace ...
4837	4840	but you see peace always finds a way.
4840	4842	Goodbye Team America.
4842	4845	I've just got one piece of bad news for you Robbins.
4845	4847	What's that?
4847	4851	I am a smoker.
4867	4868	Now that the world is going to be run peacefully ...
4868	4871	we should all drive hybird cars.
4871	4873	Right now families are gathering in parks,
4873	4874	children are walking to school,
4875	4876	friends are sitting in movie theaters.
4876	4880	all completely unaware that the world is about to change forever.
4881	4883	All because of me!
4885	4889	Stop that man!
4889	4890	Gary
4890	4892	Team America?
4892	4893	God damn it!
4893	4895	Sorry to interrupt the show everyone
4895	4896	but Kim Jong-Il is an international criminal!
4896	4898	We are here to arrest him!
4898	4899	Oh no you are not!
4899	4904	This is a peace conference and if you even try to touch Kim Jong-Il,
4905	4909	this audience and I will rise up against you.
4912	4913	Team there is no time!
4913	4916	You have to convince that audience to let you do your job!
4918	4920	Gary you've got to take the stage.
4920	4922	No, I can't upstage Alec Baldwin...
4922	4924	He is the best actor in the world!
4924	4926	You have to try.
4925	4927	I am not that good.
4927	4931	Actually! You are the finest actor I've never met.
4940	4943	Come on Gary! Hurry, you've got to act fast.
4946	4949	I know you all don't like Team America a whole lot right now but ...
4949	4953	Kim Jong-Il is a lot worse.
4955	4958	You can't outact me boy. Don't even try!
4958	4960	For the truth is that Team America fights...
4960	4962	for the billion dollar corporations!
4963	4968	They are just as bad as the enemies they fight.
4971	4972	No we aren't!
4972	4974	We are dicks!
4978	4982	We are reckless arrogent stupid dicks.
4983	4987	And the Film Actors Guild are pussies.
4988	4992	And Kim Jong-Il is an asshole.
4994	4996	Pussies don't like dicks
4996	4999	because pussies get fucked by dicks.
4999	5003	But dicks also fuck assholes.
5003	5006	Assholes who just want to shit on everything.
5006	5009	Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way.
5009	5011	But the only thing that can fuck an asshole...
5011	5015	is a dick...with some balls.
5018	5019	The problem with dicks...
5019	5021	is sometimes they fuck too much!
5021	5024	Or fuck what isn't appropiate...
5024	5026	Yes Gary, yes!
5026	5029	And it takes a pussy to show him that.
5029	5031	But sometimes pussies get so full of shit...
5031	5033	that they become assholes themselves!
5034	5038	Because pussies are only an inch and half away form assholes.
5040	5043	I don't know much in this crazy crazy world...
5043	5045	but I do know ...
5045	5049	that if you don't let us fuck this asshole,
5049	5053	we are going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit.
5071	5075	Stop what you are doing Kim Jong-Il!
5075	5078	Do something Alec Baldwin!
5078	5082	The global warming and corporate America ...
5083	5087	Fire you! You are worthless Alec Baldwin!
5096	5097	Don't fucking move!
5097	5099	You were all going to be treated to a fabulous show!
5099	5103	- But now party is over for I am the great Kim Jong-Il. - Lisa!
5103	5107	And I am the greatest terrorist ever to have lived.
5107	5111	Terrorize this!
5124	5125	Lisa, are you ok?
5125	5128	No Gary. The coundown - you have to stop it.
5128	5129	What do I do?
5129	5133	Hit the big cancel button!
5137	5139	Gary, how did you manage this?
5139	5139	Spottswoode helped me.
5139	5140	Spottswoode?
5140	5141	He is alive?
5141	5144	Lisa ... I am crazy about you!
5144	5145	- Will you please forgive me If I can just ... - Shhh!
5146	5148	You had me a dicks fuck assholes.
5149	5152	Attention! Attention Everyone!
5152	5154	All of you in the audience should go to your homes now.
5154	5156	Your countries need you!
5156	5157	But the world will be safe!
5157	5159	Thanks to a briliant actor...
5159	5163	named Gary Johnston.
5179	5182	Let me explain to you the kind of man Gary is.
5183	5184	He is a man who knows...
5184	5186	that when you put another man's cock in your mouth...
5186	5186	you make a pact!
5187	5189	A bond that cannot be broken!
5189	5191	He is the man so dedicated...
5191	5192	that he will get down on his knees...
5192	5194	and put that cock right into his mouth!
5196	5198	Wait a minute! Look!
5203	5207	You have not had the last of Kim Jong-Il.
5207	5210	I will return.
5210	5214	You shall see, I will be back.
5219	5222	So long earthlings!
5223	5226	We'll be here waiting for you, Kim Jong-Il.
5226	5228	All right you guys. I hate to break up this little party
5228	5231	but there is still a lot of bad guys out there.
5231	5235	Well then let's go show the bad guys that the police are back in force.
5235	5240	Fuck yeah!
