24	26	This is the Army.
27	31	Iùs learning how to be a soldier. And how to be much more.
36	41	Iùs cold streams that chill your bones and a hot meal to warm you up.
41	44	Iùs softball and low bridges.
44	46	Iùs a hundred ways to prove yourself.
46	47	This is the Army.
49	51	If you'd lik e to be part of it, call this number.
54	57	Thaùs my philosophy, $100 shine on a $3 pair of boots.
57	59	Yes, sir.
61	64	I don't think I've ever been this happy.
67	69	- Thank you so much. - Thank you.
76	80	I got a nice, warm cab right here. You sure?
80	83	- Leùs go. City centre. - Hey, leùs go, man.
104	106	Thanks for the ride, pal.
113	114	Shit!
117	119	God, I thought that was a dog around your neck.
119	121	If thaùs humour, don't bother.
121	124	I want to be taken to the airport. Be very careful with the bags.
124	126	Don't scratch them.
127	129	Allow me.
129	130	Thank you.
150	152	Would you be careful with those?
152	155	Madam, perhaps you'd like to eat your luggage.
156	157	I'm in a hurry.
162	165	Oh, my balls. Oh, my balls.
181	183	Good morning.
183	185	This is Basic English.
187	190	My name is Russell Ziskey...
190	193	...and I'm gonna be your instructor for the next five weeks.
193	197	I want you to call me Russell, and I'm gonna call you by your first names...
197	201	...because I would have a tough time pronouncing some of your last names.
206	209	Okay, I know you're anxious to jump right in and start speaking English...
209	212	...but there are a couple of things I need to know first because...
212	214	...l've never done this before.
214	217	So how many of you would say you speak English fairly well...
217	219	...but with some difficulty?
221	223	A little English?
225	227	Yes, you speak some English?
229	230	Son of bitch. Shit.
232	234	Son of bitch. Shit.
240	242	I've never gone this way before.
243	246	I'm sure there's a lot of ways I've gone that you haven't.
246	248	What is your name?
248	252	John Ringer? What kind of a name is Ringer?
252	254	Winger. I'm adopted.
254	257	I spent most of my life in institutions.
257	261	Doesn't surprise me. You look like a typical lowlife character to me.
266	270	Actually, I'm a photographer. I took this job because I love people.
270	273	There's nothing I enjoy more than meeting someone like yourself...
273	276	...and getting to know you, then taking photos of you while I drive.
277	281	Will you stop?! Turn around! Watch the road! Stop with the pictures!
282	283	Thank you so much.
285	286	Aren't you going too fast?
287	288	No, iùs not the speed really so much.
288	291	I just wish I hadn't drunk all that cough syrup this morning.
291	292	Oh, my!
296	298	- We're going to be killed! - Oh, no.
299	302	- Just keep your hands on the wheel! - Not killed! Not killed!
312	313	You...
313	317	You should have your license taken away.
318	322	I am going to write your name down...
322	328	...and see that iùs given to the proper authorities, G-E-R.
328	330	You're a bum!
330	333	And thaùs all you'll ever be, a bum!
336	337	Well, that hurts, ma'am.
339	341	And I don't think I want to take your abuse.
342	346	I know I don't want to take you to the airport. How about that, huh?
355	357	Hey, move that cab, buddy!
360	363	Hey! You can't stop in the middle of a bridge!
372	374	Would you get back in the car?!
376	379	Okay. Thaùs really very good. I'd like to try just one more time...
379	381	...and then we'll call it a day.
394	397	Okay, great, great. All right, we'll see you next week.
397	400	We'll learn some new tunes. We'll have a great time. Bye-bye.
400	402	Bye-bye.
420	422	Thaùs my car!
423	425	- Hey, man! - Instant Finance.
425	427	You're late on the payments, pal.
455	457	Iùs me.
462	465	- John, is that you? - Yeah.
465	469	- Did you remember to get my dress? - Yeah.
473	475	Hi, baby. You're home a little early, aren't you?
476	478	- Yeah. - How was your day?
478	479	Fine.
480	482	I got you a pizza too.
499	500	I had a real bad day.
501	503	Yeah. Yeah, I bet you did.
513	515	I quit my job.
518	520	I just can't take this anymore.
521	523	I know. I gotta straighten out.
523	525	- This is ridiculous. - Right.
525	527	Thaùs what you said last week.
527	530	You know, how much can you straighten out in one week?
531	534	It hasn't been a week, John. Iùs been six months.
534	535	Nothing's changed.
535	539	You sleep in till noon, then you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.
539	541	Then you drive your cab, what, a couple hours?
541	543	You come home, you order out food...
543	547	...and then you play those stupid Tito Puente albums until 2 in the morning!
547	549	Tito Puente is gonna be dead, and you'll say:
549	552	"I've been listening to him for years. He's fabulous."
552	554	Then you watch movies until dawn, and then...
554	557	...then you come to bed with me.
557	561	You don't think that takes energy? You're a sexual dynamo.
561	562	Most guys couldn't even handle you.
563	566	I've been reading books on the outside so I can keep up with you.
566	567	Iùs not funny.
570	571	You're going nowhere, John.
573	575	Iùs just not that cute anymore.
580	582	Iùs a little cute.
583	587	Come on. I'm part of a lost and restless generation.
588	590	What, you want me to run for the Senate?
590	592	I don't know what I want.
592	595	I just know that I don't want you.
597	601	So the basic problem is that I'm still around?
602	605	Where's that sharp knife we have? Anita!
609	610	I need you.
611	613	Come on, John.
613	616	I knew that wasn't gonna sound good.
616	617	- Anita. - No.
618	621	John, no, iùs not gonna work. I like you, but I need something more.
621	625	I need somebody who's gonna develop with me and grow. Goodbye.
625	627	- Who could grow more than me? - Goodbye.
627	629	Talk about massive potential for growth.
630	632	I am the little acorn that becomes the oak.
632	636	You can't go! All the plants are gonna die!
643	645	And then depression set in.
657	658	Go away.
668	669	Hi, John.
671	673	Whaùs the matter with you?
675	676	Nothing.
678	679	Nice shot, John.
684	686	Need a little help.
686	688	Hey, can I take your last beer?
688	690	- No. - We'll split it.
694	697	I've had an interesting morning.
697	699	In the last two hours...
699	703	...l've lost my job, my apartment...
703	706	...my car and my girlfriend.
706	708	You still have your health.
714	717	Hey. Yes, thank you. Toss that up here.
720	722	Yo. Here we are, my man.
722	725	All right, come to papa. Toss that thing. Leùs go.
727	728	Jeez.
729	731	Thank you.
732	734	The Army can mak e you feel a lot of ways:
734	738	- Tired, challenged, trained and proud. - This doesn't look bad.
740	742	What, the Army?
742	744	You're kidding.
744	747	No. I've always thought about joining the Army.
747	749	Bullshit. You're not the type.
752	755	What do you mean, I'm not the type?
755	757	I've seen the kind of guys that enlist in the Army.
758	760	I saw them when I was working on unemployment. They're like us.
761	763	Except they're not as sophisticated.
763	765	Yeah, they're not as old either.
765	768	I bet you can't do five pushups.
768	769	Five pushups?
771	773	I got $3 says I can do five pushups.
774	776	Okay, leùs go. Five good ones. Come on.
777	780	- Not Marine pushups. - No, simple pushups.
784	786	I've never heard bones creak like that.
788	789	Thaùs none.
789	792	- I'm praying. - You ought to.
792	794	Leùs go. There's a time limit here.
796	799	He's almost set. He's eyeing that rug.
801	803	And thaùs one. All right. He's off.
803	806	He's moving now. Thaùs two.
806	808	Not that good though.
812	813	Thaùs three.
814	816	I think you're ready for the Special Olympics.
817	819	Thaùs three.
820	821	- Thaùs four. - Four.
821	823	I was testing you.
823	826	And here goes five. Will he do it?
826	829	Congratulations. You just doubled your money.
835	837	I gotta get in shape.
838	841	I gotta dry out, or I'll be dead before I'm 30.
842	844	The Army's my only chance.
845	847	You could join a monastery.
848	851	Did you ever see a monk get wildly fucked by some teenage girls?
851	854	- Never. - So much for the monastery.
856	857	Brew.
860	863	- Thanks for splitting it. - No problem.
863	865	You're welcome to stay at my place if you want.
866	868	Pretty much got that roach problem licked.
869	870	I'm going Army.
871	873	You've got some warped idea about the Army.
873	876	You think iùs like a health club with neat uniforms or something.
876	879	I go in the Army, they turn my body into a dangerous weapon.
879	881	They make me a black belt.
882	885	I'll come out a human killing machine.
885	888	I think we should go to California again and pick fruit.
889	891	- They give you money. - Who?
891	895	The GI Bill. Borrow all the money you want.
895	897	Will you shut up about the Army?
897	899	You borrow the money, you buy a Winnebago.
899	900	They ship it anywhere you want.
901	903	You get lots of travel. Kathmandu, guaranteed.
903	905	Yeah, dysentery guaranteed.
905	908	I'll be over there in Nepal with those monkey-head chicks.
908	910	They'll all be hitting on me. "Hey, John...
910	913	...thanks a lot for keeping the Chinese off our backs. We appreciate it.
913	916	Is there anything we can do for you?
916	919	Oh, and by the way, handsome...
919	922	...we've never been in a Winnebago."
923	924	You figure it out.
925	928	You ever heard stories about the gratitude of the Nepalese people?
928	931	- No. - They'll probably teach me to levitate.
931	933	A black belt who can levitate.
933	936	- With a Winnebago. - Check, please.
936	938	I can see you've got this all figured out.
938	941	You're nobody's fool when it comes to your future, John.
942	944	I'm falling apart here.
944	949	All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts.
950	954	I need some heavy discipline in my life.
955	959	You know who would be incredible in the Army?
959	960	Who?
960	963	- You. - Get out of here, I'd hate it.
963	965	You would be, man. You could go right into Intelligence.
965	967	- I'm not going in. - You could be a commander.
968	970	You could probably be a general in a year.
971	974	I mean, Charles de Gaulle was a general. You're smarter than him.
974	976	That guy was like a member of the steel-plate club.
976	979	I ought to run right down there and join up, huh?
980	983	Well, I was gonna go over there. We could use your car.
984	987	- We'd have to, wouldn't we? - Yeah.
999	1001	You coming in?
1013	1015	Hey, this is a loading zone. You can't park here.
1015	1017	We're not parking it. We're abandoning it.
1018	1020	I can't believe we're doing this.
1020	1023	Listen, if I get killed, my blood is on your hands.
1023	1026	Just don't get it on my shoes, okay? Hello?
1027	1030	I'm not saying that the Army will be able to do for you what it did for me.
1030	1034	All I'm saying is you get out of it exactly what you put into it.
1034	1037	Now, sometimes the Army's your best shot.
1037	1041	There's some questions I have to ask. They're a little personal.
1041	1044	Have you ever been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanour?
1044	1047	Thaùs robbery, rape, car theft, that sort of thing?
1047	1049	- Convicted? - Yeah.
1049	1051	- No. - Never convicted.
1053	1054	Thaùs good. Good.
1055	1058	Are either of you homosexuals?
1064	1065	You mean, like, flaming or...?
1066	1069	Well, iùs a standard question we have to ask.
1069	1072	No, we're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.
1074	1076	Yeah, would they send us someplace special?
1078	1081	I guess thaùs no on both.
1081	1085	All right, now if you'll just give Uncle Sam your autograph here.
1086	1090	"Sammy, get well soon."
1090	1091	Thaùs good. Now your name.
1123	1125	Can I talk to you for a minute?
1138	1141	I was wondering if you... Are you...
1141	1144	...you know, holding? - No, man, I'm not.
1144	1147	Well, I was wondering if you could hold something for me.
1147	1150	What, are you smuggling furs or something?
1152	1153	Drugs.
1155	1158	Excuse me. General Hansen?
1158	1160	No, I'm not a general, but may I help you?
1161	1163	Yes. I want to thank you for saving my life over in Vietnam.
1164	1167	- I don't think that was me. - You're right. It was Normandy Beach.
1167	1169	I was shot up pretty bad.
1170	1172	You grabbed me, pulled me into a foxhole and patched me up.
1172	1176	I don't think so and I don't care and I don't have the time.
1176	1178	- See this arm band? MP. - Yes, ma'am.
1178	1182	Stands for military police. Are you on one of these buses?
1182	1183	Not yet, ma'am.
1183	1187	My job is to see that big, strong men like you...
1187	1189	...get on these buses without getting lost.
1189	1192	So why don't you just move along and get on the bus.
1192	1194	Did you check him off, Louise?
1194	1197	You know, there's a strip search before you get on the bus.
1197	1200	- Really? - Yeah. Be careful, man.
1203	1206	So, what, I guess we dig each other...
1206	1209	...and we'll be seeing each other around the officers' club?
1214	1217	Watch out for this guy. He's a troublemaker.
1219	1222	- Do you have your papers? - Yes. Here.
1225	1227	What happens if I refuse to get on the bus?
1227	1230	You look like a sensitive, intelligent guy.
1231	1233	Don't make me shoot you.
1233	1235	Climb aboard, soldier.
1247	1250	- What do you think? - I hope we don't go to war.
1250	1253	Excuse me, stewardess. Is there a movie on this flight?
1254	1256	- Bus. - A movie on this flight.
1305	1307	Inside. Off the bus.
1307	1310	Off the bus. Right on inside.
1310	1313	Move it out, son. Move it out.
1314	1316	Move it out!
1316	1318	Off the bus.
1320	1322	Right on inside.
1322	1324	Sergeant Hulka.
1325	1327	Yes, sir?
1333	1334	At ease, sergeant.
1335	1338	I'm Captain Stillman, the new company commander.
1338	1340	Pleased to meet you, sir.
1340	1342	Fine-looking group of men, wouldn't you say so?
1343	1347	Boy, I hope this is the mess hall.
1347	1348	How's it going, Eisenhower?
1351	1354	Yes, sir, a fine-looking bunch of men.
1354	1357	Yes, well. Get them inside...
1358	1360	...and carry on, I guess.
1360	1362	I'll be in my office if you need me.
1362	1363	Yes, sir.
1365	1367	Inside.
1371	1373	Have that removed, corporal.
1376	1377	Move it out!
1381	1385	Men, welcome to the United States Army.
1385	1387	I'm Sergeant Hulka.
1387	1389	I'm your drill sergeant.
1389	1392	Before we proceed any further...
1392	1394	...we gotta get something straight.
1397	1401	Your mamas are not here to take care of you now.
1405	1408	Iùs just you, me and Uncle Sam.
1409	1411	And before I leave you...
1411	1416	...you're gonna find out that me and Uncle Sam are one and the same.
1416	1417	Uncle Hulka?
1420	1423	When I tell you to move...
1423	1425	...you'll move fast.
1425	1427	When I tell you to jump...
1427	1430	...you're gonna say, "How high?"
1431	1433	And make no mistake.
1433	1436	I don't care where you come from, I don't care what colour you are...
1436	1439	...I don't care how smart you are or how dumb you are...
1439	1441	...because I'm gonna teach every last one of you...
1441	1444	...how to eat, sleep...
1444	1448	...walk, talk, shoot, shit like a United States soldier.
1452	1454	- Understand? - Yes, sir.
1458	1460	I didn't hear you.
1460	1462	- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
1462	1466	You don't say "sir" to me. I'm a sergeant. I work for a living.
1466	1468	- Yes, sergeant. - I didn't hear you.
1468	1471	- Yes, sergeant. - Now thaùs what I wanna hear.
1472	1475	You think this guy's overdoing it a bit?
1479	1481	You got a problem, boy?
1482	1483	No problem, sergeant.
1484	1485	On your feet, boy.
1490	1491	Whaùs your problem, boy?
1492	1494	I was just making a joke, sergeant.
1496	1499	Well, why don't you tell me your joke, son?
1499	1502	I don't think you'd think iùs funny, sir. Sergeant.
1503	1504	How do you know?
1504	1507	I got a hell of a sense of humour. Ain't I, Corporal Briggs?
1507	1509	Yes, sergeant!
1510	1514	Corporal Briggs, we have a comedian in our midst.
1515	1517	Will you take this comedian outside...
1517	1520	...and watch him do 50 pushups.
1520	1522	Get your goat-smelling ass out of here!
1524	1526	Move it!
1526	1528	Hut, ho, hut!
1528	1531	Anybody else want to be a comedian in here?
1531	1533	- No, sergeant. - I didn't hear you!
1534	1536	No, sergeant!
1598	1601	Shut up! Just shut up, will you!
1601	1603	- I didn't mean it. - How come yours is so long?
1604	1606	Fifteen and a half.
1607	1609	Thirty-three.
1610	1611	Forty-two.
1611	1613	- Thirty-seven. - Thirty-seven?
1613	1615	Step down. Grab your papers.
1615	1618	These are 34s, and they're loose.
1620	1622	I gotta live with 37?
1627	1628	Sergeant Hulka?
1629	1631	I'm sorry about what happened at the meeting.
1631	1635	I certainly meant no offence by it. It won't happen again.
1635	1637	Keep it moving! Leùs go!
1641	1643	- Think he bought it? - No.
1646	1647	Boxer or jockey?
1647	1650	You got something in a low-rise bikini? Mesh, if possible.
1653	1654	So where you from, Tex?
1655	1658	Don't you ever touch me again, ever.
1660	1662	This is pretty sweet. Free clothing.
1662	1666	Look at this stuff. Chicks in New York paying top dollar for this garbage.
1666	1668	How about that lunch? What was that brown stuff?
1670	1675	All right, men, fall in alongside this roadway in a column of two.
1675	1677	Fall in!
1677	1679	Move it! Move it!
1680	1681	Hi.
1682	1684	Move it!
1685	1689	You know something, soldier. I've noticed you're always last.
1689	1692	- I'm pacing myself, sergeant. - Move it!
1697	1698	Sorry.
1698	1700	Left face!
1703	1705	Left, right, left, right.
1706	1707	You stand in place.
1711	1713	Forward march!
1715	1716	Hey, we're walking.
1716	1720	Left, right, left, right, left, right.
1784	1787	My name's Howard J. Turkstra. I'm from Kansas City.
1788	1791	My hobbies are fast cars and fast women.
1793	1797	Because... Thaùs why guys in my car club call me "The Cruiser."
1797	1799	Should call him "The Dork."
1799	1801	Knock it off.
1801	1803	Go ahead.
1804	1808	I joined the Army because my father and my brother were in the Army.
1809	1812	I thought I'd better join before I got drafted.
1817	1820	Son, there ain't no draft no more.
1821	1822	There was one?
1825	1826	What a jerk!
1829	1830	Next.
1831	1833	The name's Francis Soyer.
1834	1836	But everybody calls me Psycho.
1838	1842	Any of you guys call me Francis, and I'll kill you.
1843	1846	You just made the list, buddy.
1846	1849	And I don't like nobody touching my stuff!
1849	1851	So just keep your meat hooks off.
1852	1855	If I catch any of you guys in my stuff, I'll kill you.
1856	1860	Also, I don't like nobody touching me.
1860	1863	Now, any of you homos...
1863	1866	...touch me, and I'll kill you.
1869	1871	Lighten up, Francis.
1875	1877	You're all in this together.
1879	1882	One of these men may save your life one of these days, understand?
1882	1885	Then again, maybe one of us won't.
1891	1893	- You, go ahead. - Me?
1893	1894	Yeah.
1894	1898	My name's Dewey Oxberger. My friends call me Ox.
1898	1901	You might have noticed I've got a slight weight problem.
1902	1903	- No! - Yeah, I do.
1904	1906	Anyway, I went to this doctor.
1906	1909	Well, he told me I swallowed a lot of aggression...
1910	1911	...along with a lot of pizzas.
1912	1913	Pizzas!
1914	1916	I'm basically a shy person.
1916	1918	I'm a shy guy...
1918	1921	...and he suggested taking one of these aggression-training courses.
1921	1925	You know, these aggressive-training courses like EST, those type of things.
1925	1928	Anyway, it costs 400 bucks to join this thing.
1928	1931	Well, I didn't have the money.
1931	1936	And I thought to myself, "Join the Army. Iùs free."
1936	1939	So I figured while I'm here I'll lose a few pounds.
1940	1942	You got a six- to eight-week training program here, a tough one.
1943	1944	Which is perfect for me.
1945	1949	I'm gonna walk out of here a lean, mean, fighting machine.
1950	1953	- Good thinking, Ox. Real good. - It is.
1953	1955	Ziskey.
1955	1958	I've always been kind of a pacifist.
1958	1961	When I was a kid my father told me, "Never hit anyone in anger...
1961	1965	...unless you're absolutely sure you can get away with it."
1966	1968	I don't know what kind of soldier I'll make...
1969	1974	...but I want you guys to know that if we ever get into real heavy combat...
1974	1978	...l'll be right behind you guys every step of the way.
1982	1986	Okay, Mr. Pushups. Leùs hear your story.
1986	1990	Chicks dig me because I rarely wear underwear...
1990	1993	...and when I do, iùs usually something unusual.
1993	1998	But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you.
1999	2001	Iùs not just the uniform.
2001	2003	Iùs the stories that you tell.
2003	2006	So much fun and imagination.
2006	2008	Lee Harvey...
2008	2011	...you are a madman.
2012	2016	When you stole that cow...
2016	2019	...and your friends tried to make it with the cow.
2019	2022	I want to party with you, cowboy.
2023	2026	The two of us together, forget it.
2027	2029	I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
2031	2034	I'm gonna volunteer my leadership to this platoon.
2034	2037	An Army without leaders is like a foot...
2038	2040	...without a big toe.
2040	2043	And Sergeant Hulka isn't always gonna be there...
2043	2045	...to be that big toe for us.
2046	2050	I think that we owe a big round of applause...
2050	2053	...to our newest, bestest buddy...
2053	2055	...and big toe...
2055	2057	...Sergeant Hulka.
2066	2068	Well, okay, hotshot.
2068	2071	We're gonna see what kind of soldier you are.
2071	2074	Reveille is 0500.
2075	2076	We're gonna fall out with locker boxes...
2076	2079	...and we're gonna have a locker-box inspection.
2079	2083	And then we're gonna do 10 miles, rain or shine.
2084	2087	So you better hit them bunks, my little babies...
2087	2089	...or Sergeant Hulka with the big toe...
2089	2092	...is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass.
2103	2105	Out of them bunks!
2114	2116	We got a full day ahead of us.
2116	2118	We're gonna start out with a five-mile run.
2119	2121	I know I'm speaking for the entire platoon when I say...
2121	2126	...this run should be postponed until this platoon is better rested.
2130	2134	Well, I'll tell you what, soldier. Leùs make it 10 miles.
2134	2136	Any more complaints?
2138	2140	Thanks a lot, Winger!
2144	2146	Nice going, asshole.
2150	2152	You're making friends fast around here, John.
2155	2158	Oh, my... Oh, my God! Mama!
2167	2169	Captain Stillman.
2171	2175	Major Ellis would like you to look over these interim reports, captain, sir.
2176	2179	Interim reports! Thaùs all I ever do around here.
2180	2181	I want some action!
2184	2185	Hold that, corporal.
2188	2190	Oh, look at those men.
2190	2192	Are those my men, corporal?
2192	2195	No, sir. Those are Captain Benton's men, sir.
2195	2197	Well, where are my men?
2197	2199	Leùs see. Sergeant Hulka is on the confidence course.
2200	2201	Sergeant Crocker is on the mortar range.
2202	2204	Terrific. Corporal, bring up the jeep.
2205	2206	Yes, sir.
2209	2210	Grenade!
2218	2220	Go get them!
2225	2228	Those are damn fine men. Are they in my company?
2228	2231	No, sir. Oh, here come your men now, sir.
2270	2272	Hit it!
2275	2277	Hit it!
2282	2283	Hit it!
2287	2289	Stand up when I'm sticking you, boy!
2290	2291	Get down and give me 50, mother!
2292	2295	Come on! I'll walk on your ass, boy! I was killing...
2296	2299	Fifteen, 16, 17...
2324	2326	Twenty-seven, 28...
2327	2328	Wait a minute.
2328	2330	- You got the light one. - Yeah, my mistake.
2330	2331	- Yeah. - Here, leùs switch.
2331	2334	- I kind of thought it was a mistake. - I got it.
2334	2336	Iùs real heavy.
2336	2337	This one's light. Stand out of the way.
2345	2346	Fall out!
2348	2350	- Stop! Fall in! - Hey, sergeant, iùs raining.
2350	2353	Sergeant, I think iùs a bad idea to march today.
2353	2355	You know, this is the cold and flu season.
2356	2359	Fifty-one, 52...
2360	2363	- When's the good part, John? - This is the good part.
2363	2366	Get your butt down, soldier. You'll get it shot off someday. Move it!
2367	2368	Move it!
2393	2395	You all right?
2401	2403	I shoulÔve kept my head down.
2405	2408	I learned a lot of things today, John.
2409	2412	I've never felt more alive in my whole life.
2413	2416	I think this is the greatest day I've ever spent.
2417	2419	And I want to thank you for making me join the Army.
2423	2425	Get me out of here.
2426	2428	I'll take care of you.
2431	2433	Going south today? All right.
2437	2440	- So, what are you taking? - Oh, I got these from Elmo.
2440	2443	I told him I get sick when I fly. I think they're Dramamine.
2444	2447	These are Elmo's microdots. Thaùs acid.
2451	2452	John.
2455	2458	- John, I took a lot of these. - How many?
2458	2461	Well, one just now and one in the barracks.
2461	2463	Two in the jeep.
2463	2467	- Two when we got out of the jeep. - Oh, no. Six hits.
2468	2470	What a tragedy. Hey. Hey.
2470	2473	We're not gonna let you drive now, you sit right down here.
2473	2475	Buckle up here, cowpoke.
2475	2478	Stow your tray table in the upright position, will you?
2478	2481	You're gonna be just fine in about 12 hours.
2481	2484	Iùs gonna be kind of weird till then, but...
2496	2498	The plane's coming apart.
2500	2502	Hello!
2530	2533	I'm Captain Hollister, Special Operations Group. Who are you?
2533	2535	- I'm Major Dodge. - Captain DeSoto.
2536	2538	Pleasure to meet you, Hollister. Heard a lot about you.
2538	2541	Well, I never heard of you. And you're not on my roster.
2542	2545	Thaùs just the way we like to keep it, captain.
2546	2548	Iùs double double top-secret.
2549	2552	- Intelligence? - Some.
2552	2555	Anything I could tell you would be a lie, captain...
2555	2558	...so how about we tag along with you to your destination...
2558	2560	...and then we'll go our separate ways.
2561	2563	Dismissed, captain.
2587	2589	Okay, major, leùs go!
2589	2591	Go!
2592	2593	Go!
2594	2596	Russell!
2597	2599	They're all going backpacking, John!
2603	2604	Go! Go! Go!
2620	2623	The important thing is not to panic.
2623	2626	We should, like, build a shelter, I think.
2626	2629	Then we make some stone tools and we can cut some spears and arrows.
2630	2632	Because tonight we're gonna go out and kill a wild boar.
2632	2634	And then we're gonna dry the meat for travelling.
2634	2637	And in the morning we can chop down a big tree...
2637	2639	...and make a dugout canoe.
2639	2642	And we could find a river thaùll probably run down to the ocean.
2642	2646	If we're lucky, we'll drift into one of those major shipping lanes...
2646	2649	...we'll probably get picked up in a day or two by a Liberian freighter.
2649	2650	What do you think?
2651	2653	I think we should find a hotel room.
2654	2656	Thaùs a good idea.
2661	2662	Hello!
2664	2667	I think some of these plants are edible.
2667	2669	- Yeah. - Not that one.
2670	2672	I think we might have to settle for a motel.
2673	2677	- This looks like a main road. - Oh, yeah, this is the interstate here.
2677	2681	Yeah. We just find a gas station, they'll tell us where all the nice...
2684	2687	What a rush. The sky is brown.
2710	2711	Hi.
2717	2718	Thank you.
2721	2722	Sit down.
2742	2743	Thank you.
2749	2752	Colombia. Love weed.
2754	2755	Good, good, good.
2755	2757	Pills.
2759	2760	For you.
2766	2768	Good, good.
2771	2772	Oh, yeah.
2772	2775	- Oh, iùs good in stew, yeah. - Yeah, put about 30 in there.
2776	2778	Thaùs good. Oh, great.
2778	2780	Time to get out of here.
2789	2790	What is their struggle?
2800	2801	Iùs cutting time.
2849	2852	I can't hear you! You two should tie the knot!
2881	2885	Hey, captain, could we get a ride with you?
2886	2888	Just get on the plane.
2889	2890	You bet.
2902	2903	Oh, God, look at that.
2903	2906	Wash off the soap. Thaùs right. Wash it off.
2906	2909	Look at that. Bend over. Drop the soap. Oh, tits. Good.
2909	2913	Oh, God, I wish I was a loofah. Look at that! Thaùs...
2913	2916	Those muscles.
2917	2920	Oh, I didn't know they could do that.
2921	2924	- Excuse me, captain. - I don't want to be disturbed.
2924	2926	Stillman!
2927	2929	- Yes, sir? - Colonel Glass to see you, sir.
2930	2932	I can see that, corporal. Dismissed.
2932	2935	Iùs a pleasure to see you, sir. Welcome to Fort Arnold.
2935	2937	- Leùs skip the bullshit, captain. - Yes, sir.
2938	2940	I've got a problem, and I need your help.
2940	2942	You've heard of the EM-50 project?
2942	2945	Yes, sir. Iùs a tank or something.
2945	2947	- Iùs an urban-assault vehicle. - Of course.
2947	2951	The Pentagon wants to unveil it for the news media next month in Italy.
2951	2953	What General Barnicke wants from you...
2954	2958	...is a real crack platoon of new recruits to man the EM-50.
2958	2960	Real go-getters.
2960	2963	We'll have them photographed putting the 50 through its paces.
2964	2966	"Our newest soldiers with our latest weapon." That kind of thing.
2967	2969	Yes, sir. You can count on me, sir.
2969	2971	You screw this up, Stillman...
2971	2974	...and I'll have you assigned to a weather station above the Arctic Circle.
2975	2977	- You got that? - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
2977	2978	Good.
2981	2983	Attention!
2989	2990	- I'm gonna fold. - Okay.
2991	2993	Well, I'm still in. Cruise, how about you?
2994	2995	Maybe I should fold.
2995	2997	Well, let me see. Let me see first.
2997	3000	No, not with a hand like that. Come on.
3000	3003	Dare me. Go on, bluff me. Come on.
3003	3004	How much should I bet?
3005	3007	If it were me, I'd bet everything.
3007	3010	But thaùs me. I'm an aggressive gambler. Mr. Vegas.
3012	3016	Come on. Go for it. Go for it.
3016	3018	Yes, yes, there we go. I'm in.
3018	3020	- What do you got? - Well, I got a full house.
3020	3023	Three threes and two sixes, thaùs a full house. What have you got?
3024	3026	- Two fours, I got an ace. - You got an ace, an eight and a seven.
3027	3031	Well, you lose. If you woulÔve had four fours, you woulÔve won.
3031	3033	- You're getting good. - Starting to get the hang of it.
3033	3037	Isn't this fun? You're pretty good for a first time, really.
3037	3038	Attention!
3039	3042	Fall in for muster. Move it! Move it!
3044	3045	Ten-hut!
3048	3050	Iùs come to my attention...
3050	3054	...that several members of the 3rd Platoon Bravo Company...
3054	3057	...left this military post without permission.
3060	3062	I wanna know who it was.
3064	3066	You can tell me now...
3069	3072	...or I got ways of finding out myself.
3083	3085	Okay, mister...
3085	3090	...you just got yourself 24 hours of scrubbing garbage cans.
3090	3092	Step back!
3095	3099	Now, since nobody else has got the guts...
3100	3102	...to admit it...
3103	3106	...the rest of this platoon...
3106	3109	...will do the next two weekends on KP.
3112	3114	How's that sound to you, mister?
3114	3116	I think it sucks.
3118	3122	Iùs time you and me had a private talk, Winger.
3122	3124	Step into my office.
3136	3139	I'm getting the idea, Winger, that you don't like me.
3139	3142	Maybe I just don't know you well enough yet, sarge.
3142	3145	What do you say leùs cut out the bullshit between you and me.
3145	3148	- Oh, leùs. - I think you're a punk.
3149	3151	I've been in this Army 28 years.
3152	3154	I've seen your kind come and go.
3157	3160	You think you know something about everything, don't you?
3160	3162	Let me tell you something, mister.
3162	3164	You don't know a damn thing about soldiering.
3164	3168	Oh, iùs real tough stuff. Especially that marching-in-a-straight-line business.
3168	3172	I ain't talking about that crap! I'm talking about something important.
3172	3175	Like discipline and duty and honour and courage. You ain't got none of it.
3176	3180	Those words mean so much to a man who scrubs garbage cans.
3180	3183	Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out...
3183	3186	...but get off my back.
3188	3191	Maybe you'd like to take a swing at me.
3192	3196	I'd like to take a big swing at you, sarge.
3197	3199	Well, go ahead and give it your best shot.
3200	3203	I don't think I wanna go to the stockade.
3210	3212	I'll take my hat off.
3217	3221	There we are, Winger. Ain't no more drill sergeant.
3221	3224	Iùs just you and me, kid, man-to-man.
3225	3228	So go ahead, give it your best shot.
3228	3230	Swing at me.
3232	3233	Gutless.
3234	3235	Punk.
3248	3251	I'm willing to forget about this little incident.
3251	3254	And I want you to think real hard about it.
3254	3258	And maybe someday you'll understand what the hell I'm talking about.
3269	3271	No. No, don't stop.
3271	3273	Don't stop.
3273	3276	I'll still respect you.
3276	3278	I'll respect you even more.
3279	3281	Just use more whipped cream.
3287	3290	John. John.
3290	3293	I just had the weirdest dream. John.
3296	3298	John?
3309	3312	If I call Anita, she has to pick me up at the train, right?
3317	3319	I go back, get a new apartment...
3319	3322	...I see if I can get my cab job back.
3336	3339	Where are you going? You going AWOL? Are you going AWOL?
3340	3341	- No, I'm deserting. - You idiot!
3342	3344	You desert now, iùs a federal offence.
3344	3347	- Come on. - I'll take my chances with the feds.
3347	3349	Get up. Come on. You're not going anywhere.
3349	3352	Now listen to me. You're gonna finish basic training...
3352	3355	...you're gonna keep your mouth shut and do everything he tells you.
3355	3356	- And you know why? - Why?
3356	3361	Because you talked me into this, thaùs why, you idiot! It was your idea!
3361	3363	I didn't talk you into this. You needed this.
3364	3366	I'm gonna kill you! Damn you!
3366	3370	Where's the great pay? Where's the travel?
3370	3374	Where's the Winnebago? Goddamn it! Shit!
3383	3386	This isn't what you think.
3386	3387	No, we're just good friends.
3388	3390	In the jeep.
3392	3394	Come on. Leùs go.
3394	3398	I was going to the laundry, get my uniform.
3398	3400	Save it for later.
3411	3414	Okay, guys, you're home. Get out.
3420	3423	You're not gonna report this or anything, are you?
3424	3426	I'm gonna treat it like a UFO sighting.
3426	3430	"I saw something, but I'm not quite sure what it was."
3431	3432	Thank you.
3441	3442	Oh, goodbye.
3472	3474	Move it! Do it!
3482	3483	Why, boy...
3484	3487	...we got women can climb that better than you. Get up!
3487	3489	Get on your feet!
3491	3492	Hit it!
3493	3495	He said he couldn't make it. Why don't you do it?
3502	3505	Take one step back, Winger.
3505	3507	Move it!
3523	3527	All right, soldier, leùs see how you fire that mortar.
3528	3530	- What coordinates, sir? - Coordinates?
3532	3534	Yes, sir. They determine where the mortar's...
3534	3537	Soldier, the Army has spent a lot of money teaching you how to fire that.
3537	3540	Now set it and fire it.
3540	3544	- We don't know where the shell's... - The only way to learn is to do it!
3545	3546	Now fire the weapon.
3554	3555	All right!
3556	3559	Any of you suckholes want to come up here and knock me off?
3563	3564	Oh, shit.
3567	3568	Incoming!
3591	3595	Sergeant, does this mean we're through for the day?
3598	3599	- Save your strength, sarge. - Yeah.
3600	3602	Get him off! Get him off!
3613	3618	Men, I realize this tragic injury to your drill sergeant is a real shock.
3618	3621	Especially this close to the end of basic training.
3622	3626	As far as I'm concerned, Sergeant Crocker's 100 percent responsible...
3627	3628	...for the entire thing.
3628	3630	Thaùs not what I heard.
3630	3633	Who said that? Pick that up! Who said that?
3633	3635	- Did you say that? - No, sir.
3635	3638	- Did you say that? Who said...? - I said that.
3639	3641	Now, I don't care what you heard.
3641	3644	My report states that Crocker was negligent in his mortar instructions...
3644	3646	...and totally unable to control his men.
3646	3649	Have it your way, sir.
3650	3651	You bet I will, soldier.
3651	3653	I do not want to hear one more insubordinate word...
3653	3655	...from anyone in this platoon.
3655	3657	The subject is closed.
3657	3660	You'd better stop worrying about what happened to Hulka...
3660	3664	...and start worrying about how you're going to pass muster at graduation.
3664	3666	You've got three days to get it together.
3667	3670	And if you want my honest opinion...
3672	3674	...you're not gonna make it.
3675	3676	No stragglers. Now come on.
3676	3680	We owe it to Sergeant Hulka to end up face down in the gutter tonight.
3680	3682	Hey, baby, want to come to my place?
3682	3685	Where were you two blocks ago when we coulÔve used you?
3685	3687	Come on. Don't waste it.
3687	3690	All right, we're here! Come on.
3690	3692	Iùs the Pom Pom. Iùs famous. Iùs world-famous.
3703	3705	This might be fun.
3706	3707	Hi.
3734	3736	Oh, amazing.
3736	3739	I used to wrestle. There's no tables.
3739	3742	- Here's a table. Excuse me. - Sounds good.
3742	3745	- You wrestled, huh? Nice seats. - Yeah.
3745	3747	Give me a kick, honey.
3747	3749	Oh, parted my hair.
3752	3754	Okay, girls, go get them!
3785	3787	We're gonna start the bidding.
3787	3790	I'm not gonna accept anything less than $100.
3791	3792	The bidding has gotta start. Now give me 100.
3793	3795	- You gotta do it for us, Ox. - I can't.
3795	3798	- You said you used to wrestle. - I used to lose a lot.
3798	3800	Yeah, but these are girls. They're weak and soft.
3800	3803	- I need 150! - One-sixty!
3803	3807	One-seventy-five now! One-seventy-five here! One-eighty!
3807	3809	- It doesn't seem fair. - Fair?
3810	3813	Who cares about fair? The world isn't fair! Truth isn't fair!
3813	3816	Is it fair that you were born like this? No!
3816	3819	They're not expecting somebody like you. They're expecting some clown.
3819	3822	You're different. You're weird. You're a mutant. You're a killer!
3823	3824	You're a trained killer!
3824	3828	You're a lean, mean, fighting machine!
3828	3829	I'll do it!
3830	3833	- All right. Give me your money. - Four hundred and thirteen bucks!
3833	3837	My man. My big man here is gonna do it all for us...
3837	3840	...for $413...
3840	3842	- And 58 cents. ...and 58 cents!
3842	3847	Four hundred thirteen dollars and 58 cents!
3847	3849	I'll take that right now!
3854	3857	Ladies and gentlemen, the big event you've been waiting for.
3857	3861	A three-round match, five-minute time limit, one pin only.
3861	3864	And during this match there will be absolutely no biting.
3864	3866	Cut that out! Cut that out!
3866	3869	And no pulling of the nose.
3869	3872	Hey, do something about this, ref! What kind of place you running here?
3873	3876	And no kicking, ladies and gentlemen.
3876	3879	All right, go to your neutral corners, and we will begin the match!
3893	3895	Hey, wait a minute! Wait! Hey!
3897	3899	Hey, just a second here!
3909	3911	Oh, jeez! Now you done it.
3916	3918	Beat the shit out of them, Ox!
3918	3922	- You hit me! I'm a girl! - I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hit you!
3925	3928	Thaùs my man out there! My champ! Now stop it!
3934	3937	Behind you! She's not even in the fight.
3955	3957	Cut that out. Cut that out.
3957	3959	You get in here. Come on.
3959	3961	I'm a gentleman. Now stop it.
3961	3963	All right.
3963	3965	Okay, all right.
3965	3966	- Thanks. - No problem.
3966	3968	- Thanks again. - Okay, all right.
3969	3971	- You're very competitive. - I don't wanna go back.
3971	3974	You gotta go back. You're already dirty. Come on.
3975	3977	All right, there you go.
3997	3999	They got him down and they got him pinned!
4006	4008	Bravo Company!
4011	4013	Bravo Company!
4013	4015	Go, man!
4022	4024	Way to go, Ox! Kill them!
4052	4054	- Should we? - Yeah. Leùs go.
4060	4062	We'll take care of these two.
4062	4064	Iùs okay. Special assignment.
4065	4066	Yeah, we're with them.
4066	4070	Louise, iùs so nice to see you. What are you doing here?
4072	4075	Well, explain yourselves.
4079	4082	Well, sir, we were...
4082	4084	We were going to the Bingo parlour...
4084	4086	...at the YMCA.
4086	4088	Well, one thing led to another...
4089	4091	...and the instructions got all fouled up there.
4091	4093	- We ended up... - Shut up.
4093	4095	Okay, sir.
4098	4101	You men are a disgrace.
4103	4107	Maybe a few days in the stockade...
4107	4111	...would help change your rotten attitude.
4112	4114	But we're supposed to graduate tomorrow, sir.
4116	4117	Thaùs even better.
4119	4123	Tomorrow you'll be on parade in front of General Barnicke.
4125	4128	And when he sees what total fuck-ups you really are...
4129	4131	...I will personally recommend...
4132	4134	...that your whole platoon...
4134	4138	...repeat the entire course of basic training.
4151	4153	Well, get out.
4163	4166	All right, now this is the second time we've let you guys off.
4166	4168	So leùs not let it happen a third time. Is that clear?
4169	4172	- Very clear. - Get back to your barracks, all right?
4172	4174	- Good night. - Good night.
4174	4177	So, what are you guys gonna do?
4177	4181	We're gonna check out General Barnicke's house. He's in Washington.
4181	4182	Barnicke?
4183	4184	Barnicke?!
4184	4187	He still owes me money. Hey, Barney!
4188	4191	Get him!
4191	4193	Mom! I'm home!
4194	4195	John!
4196	4200	- No, no. - Now, don't worry about a thing, okay?
4200	4202	Oh, this is nice, really.
4203	4207	Listen, if this is gonna get you in trouble, we'll leave. All right?
4207	4210	No, iùs okay. General Barnicke's gone until tomorrow morning.
4210	4212	Good.
4214	4215	Thank you.
4216	4219	I feel like I'm 16 years old in my parents' house...
4219	4222	...and they're away on a trip.
4222	4224	Sixteen? Wanna play Spin the Bottle?
4225	4227	This guy's doing pretty well. Interested?
4227	4230	All right, you've looked at the general's refrigerator long enough.
4230	4233	- Leùs go. Come on. - Leùs look at the general's cupboards.
4233	4235	John!
4235	4239	You know, you're very pretty...
4240	4242	...for a cop. - Oh, thanks a lot.
4242	4245	No, thank you. You know what your problem is, baby?
4245	4247	- No, I don't. - Your problem is that you're armed.
4247	4248	You're heavily armed.
4248	4251	Guys have trouble with girls that are armed.
4251	4254	They don't know how to come on. Do you know the rest of your problem?
4254	4255	Tell me.
4255	4257	You've never had anyone give you the Aunt Jemima treatment.
4258	4261	- No, I certainly haven't had that. - First you get up on the grill.
4263	4265	- I'll get you up to cruising speed. - Stop it!
4265	4269	You're sticking on the bottom, dear. Keep hopping. Keep hopping, honey!
4269	4272	There you go. A little bit lumpy. You're a little bit lumpy.
4272	4274	A little bit lumpy.
4274	4278	- I'm not enjoying this! Now quit it! - You're not, huh?
4278	4280	Maybe you need this.
4281	4284	- What are you gonna do with that? - This. And this.
4287	4289	Who's your friend? Who's your buddy?
4290	4291	I am, aren't I?
4291	4293	- You're crazy about me, aren't you? - No.
4293	4295	You're head over heels in love with me.
4295	4298	You're hopelessly, deeply in love with me, aren't you?
4298	4299	Yes.
4300	4303	I knew it. I had that feeling.
4303	4305	Even before I picked this up.
4306	4308	Iùs about time you came around.
4309	4311	So, what do we do now?
4312	4315	Leùs go upstairs and check out the general's closets.
4318	4320	Nice to know you can move like that when you have to.
4321	4324	Well, iùs nice to know you can make me so hot.
4324	4325	You say the nicest things.
4326	4329	Hold on, honey. I got a special tool for you.
4329	4330	Come here.
4333	4335	I can't believe we're playing this.
4336	4338	- Okay, down on your knees. - Sounds good.
4340	4342	All right, now the way that you play it is...
4342	4346	...you pretend there's a force field all around your body...
4346	4350	...and you try and get as close to each other as possible...
4350	4352	...without actually touching.
4353	4355	- Okay? - It sounds easy.
4357	4359	It ought to be.
4366	4368	I think I'm good at this.
4368	4370	Maybe.
4370	4372	How do you win?
4372	4375	Well, if somebody breaks your force field, then you win.
4377	4380	- You just broke my force field. - Yeah, you win.
4392	4394	Well, that was interesting.
4396	4400	Iùs all over with now. We might as well not even show up to graduation.
4400	4402	You white guys'll probably get five years.
4402	4404	- But we gonna get hung. - Yeah, man.
4404	4407	Guys! Hey!
4411	4413	Whaùs everybody so down about?
4413	4415	Didn't everybody make it with a beautiful MP tonight, huh?
4415	4419	Oh, Stillman freaked out when the MPs brought us back.
4419	4422	If we screw up graduation, we'll have to take basics all over again.
4422	4425	Oh, Cruise, iùs been a lot of fun the first time, hasn't it?
4425	4428	I can't handle basic training again, man.
4431	4434	You're number one on the death list now, Winger.
4436	4439	Take it easy, Francis... Psycho.
4441	4444	Will you guys just relax? We got plenty of time. What time is it now?
4445	4447	- Two a.m. - Okay, 0200.
4447	4449	- What time we get up? - Five a.m.
4450	4454	0500. All right, we have three hours. Didn't you ever cram for a test before?
4457	4459	I learned two semesters of geology in three hours.
4459	4461	We can do this. We just have to practice.
4461	4464	We've been practicing all night, and we stink.
4464	4468	- Yeah, well, the brains have arrived. - Yeah, thaùs good news.
4468	4470	We go down to the motor pool.
4470	4472	We work on it all night. We get it together.
4472	4476	- We can do this, right? - There's no way in hell we can do it.
4476	4478	Right shoulder, arms!
4480	4482	Forward, arms!
4483	4485	Inspection, arms!
4487	4489	Right shoulder, arms!
4490	4492	Right face!
4493	4496	Your left, your left, your left.
4497	4499	Come on, rhythm. Hut, two, three, four.
4499	4501	Black guys, help the white guys, okay?
4501	4505	- What did he say? - He said the black guys...
4505	4507	...help the white guys.
4508	4510	Come on, guys!
4510	4512	Wait a minute!
4515	4517	Cut it out! Stop!
4517	4519	Hey, stupid, look at yourself!
4519	4524	Cut it out! Cut it out!
4525	4527	What the hell's the matter with you?
4528	4529	Stupid!
4531	4533	We're all very different people.
4533	4536	We're not Watusi. We're not Spartans.
4536	4539	We're Americans. With a capital A, huh?
4539	4541	You know what that means?
4541	4544	Do you? That means that our forefathers...
4544	4548	...were kicked out of every decent country in the world.
4548	4551	We are the wretched refuse.
4553	4556	We're the underdog. We're mutts.
4556	4560	- Here's proof. His nose is cold. - So is his brain.
4560	4563	But there's no animal thaùs more faithful...
4563	4568	...thaùs more loyal, more loveable than the mutt.
4568	4570	Who saw Old Yeller?
4573	4576	Who cried when Old Yeller got shot at the end?
4577	4580	Nobody cried when Old Yeller got shot? I'm sure.
4582	4584	I cried my eyes out.
4585	4586	Yeah.
4586	4589	So we're all dogfaces. We're all very, very different.
4590	4592	But there is one thing that we all have in common.
4592	4597	We were all stupid enough to enlist in the Army.
4597	4599	We're mutants.
4599	4603	There's something wrong with us, something very, very wrong with us.
4603	4606	Something seriously wrong with us.
4606	4609	We're soldiers, but we're American soldiers.
4610	4614	We've been kicking ass for 200 years! We're 10 and 1!
4616	4619	Now we don't have to worry...
4619	4622	...about whether or not we've practiced.
4622	4624	We don't have to worry...
4624	4626	...about whether Captain Stillman wants to have us hung.
4627	4629	All we have to do...
4629	4633	...is to be the great American fighting soldier...
4634	4636	...that is inside each one of us.
4638	4640	Now, do what I do...
4641	4644	...and say what I say...
4647	4649	...and make me proud.
4651	4654	- Fall in! - Yeah!
4655	4656	Platoon...
4658	4660	...ten-hut!
4662	4665	Right shoulder, ho!
4666	4668	Order, ho!
4690	4692	Maybe they couldn't find the parade grounds.
4692	4695	- Iùs right in front of the barracks. - Thaùs what I mean.
4703	4705	Eyes right!
4708	4710	We checked the barracks, sir. They're not there.
4710	4714	If they're not here in five minutes, I want them arrested.
4726	4729	Hey, graduation's at 2:00. What time is it now?
4731	4733	Three o'clock. We've still got an hour to sleep.
4733	4735	Oh, good.
4735	4738	Three o'clock! We're missing it!
4739	4743	John! John! We're missing graduation.
4743	4746	- We're missing it. - Leùs go.
4746	4748	Wake up, man! We're missing it.
4776	4778	Where is it?
4826	4829	All right, leùs do a little singing this morning.
4842	4844	Oh, my God!
4869	4870	Platoon...
4872	4874	...a- one, two:
4882	4885	Where the hell have you been, soldier?
4885	4888	- Training, sir! - Training, sir!
4888	4890	What kind of training, son?
4890	4893	Army training, sir!
4893	4895	Army training, sir!
4895	4899	Platoon, just like last night, only better!
4899	4902	And right shoulder, ho!
4904	4906	Order, ho!
4907	4909	Side step right!
4920	4922	Left flank, left!
4927	4929	Queen Anne salute!
4931	4933	Three, five, seven!
4939	4941	Razzle-dazzle!
4941	4943	Hut, two, three, four!
4944	4946	Hut, two, three, four.
4946	4950	The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, sir!
4962	4966	- Where's your drill sergeant, men? - Blown up, sir!
4966	4968	Blown up, sir!
4970	4975	Sir, these are Sergeant Hulka's men. He was injured during basic training.
4975	4976	I see.
4976	4980	So am I to understand that you men completed your training on your own?
4980	4983	- Thaùs the fact, Jack! - Thaùs the fact, Jack!
4984	4985	- Captain. - Yes, sir?
4986	4987	These are exactly the kind of go-getters...
4987	4990	...I want working on my EM-50 project in Italy.
4991	4994	- Oh, but, sir, these men... - Don't "but" me, captain.
4994	4996	I want them on the plane tonight.
4997	5001	Gentlemen, iùs party time, Italian style!
5021	5023	Not bad! Iùs great.
5024	5028	Best bunk? Best bunk is...
5028	5030	Best bunk, right here.
5032	5035	- Okay, who's up for the Vatican? - No, I can't.
5035	5038	Leùs get some people and some relics, and we'll do it.
5039	5043	What are you doing? No, get off. See, you gotta make my bunk.
5043	5045	See, we're in Italy. The guy on the top bunk...
5045	5048	...has gotta make the guy on the bottom's bed all the time
5048	5050	Iùs in the regulations. If we were in Germany...
5051	5052	...I would have to make yours.
5052	5055	But we're in Italy, so you've gotta make mine. Iùs regulations.
5056	5057	Who's gonna make the beds?
5058	5060	Buona sera, gentlemen.
5062	5065	It is alive.
5075	5077	Welcome to Italy.
5078	5081	We can forget all about the tearful reunion.
5082	5087	There's a couple things I want to get straight with you right off the bat.
5087	5090	I don't know what kind of shit you pulled at graduation...
5091	5094	...but this ain't no glamour detail we're on.
5095	5096	I want to see you walking tall...
5097	5099	...looking good and mentally alert at all times.
5100	5101	I'm gonna bust your butts...
5101	5105	...to make this the best damned outfit in the European command.
5107	5111	Get these bunks made up! Get your gear stored!
5111	5115	We're gonna muster in front of the motor pool at 0600! Got it?
5115	5117	Hi, sarge.
5119	5122	"Hi, sarge." Just shut up.
5122	5124	0600!
5136	5138	As you may know, General Barnicke...
5138	5141	...is particularly interested in this project.
5142	5146	He has selected this platoon for this assignment...
5147	5150	...and he expects you to perform particularly well.
5152	5154	Raise it, sergeant.
5157	5161	Gentlemen, this is the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle.
5168	5171	A real beauty, colonel. You can count on us.
5181	5182	Fall in!
5188	5190	I need two volunteers.
5190	5192	You and you.
5192	5195	You'll guard this vehicle until 0800 on Monday morning...
5195	5198	...and the rest of you got the weekend off. Dismissed!
5205	5208	- Sarge, why me? - Oh, I don't know, son.
5208	5211	I ain't got no military reason for it, I just don't like you.
5212	5214	Have a nice weekend.
5215	5220	Oh, yeah. I want that so clean I could eat off the floor.
5228	5233	This is amazing. You wouldn't believe what this thing could do.
5237	5239	John.
5239	5241	John.
5242	5245	- Do you think I'm officer material? - God, I'm worried about you.
5246	5248	Come on. I'm in good shape. I'm walking tall.
5248	5251	I'm looking good. First weekend in Europe.
5251	5255	Yeah. We're spending it in an airplane hangar watching a truck.
5255	5256	We got each other.
5257	5260	Well, I was kind of thinking we'd get a couple companions this weekend.
5260	5262	Too bad the girls are in Germany.
5262	5263	We could get...
5263	5265	...a hotel room somewhere. - Yeah.
5265	5267	Spend a few days eating room service.
5267	5269	WoulÔve been good.
5269	5273	We could take them up in the Alps for a little spin.
5279	5280	- No. - Oh, yeah.
5280	5282	- No, no, no. - Oh, yeah.
5283	5286	- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - No, no. No, John, no.
5286	5288	- I'll drive. - Okay.
5294	5296	We're here.
5296	5298	Don't forget, you promised me a real expensive dinner...
5298	5301	...before we see this whatever it is.
5301	5302	Right.
5308	5309	Come with me, my dear.
5316	5321	Now, don't forget, this is a big secret, so you can't tell anybody, okay?
5321	5324	- Not unless they torture me. - Come on.
5325	5328	- Official business. - May I see your identification, sir?
5328	5331	Thank you, captain.
5331	5334	Yeah. Just follow me.
5337	5341	When the Army entrusts an important project like this to an officer...
5341	5346	...it usually means they're priming him for a major promotion.
5351	5354	- I really think you're gonna like this. - Yeah?
5362	5366	- Are you gonna get sick or something? - Where the fuck's my truck? Where...?
5368	5370	Where's my truck? Hey!
5370	5373	Hey, where's the EM-50?
5373	5375	A couple of soldiers took it to get it washed, sir.
5376	5377	Took it to get it washed?!
5377	5380	Is there a bathroom around here? I gotta pee.
5380	5382	- Hold it! - They had proper ID, sir.
5382	5385	Do you want me to notify post security, sir?
5385	5387	You keep your mouth shut about this. Do you understand me?
5388	5391	And you let no one in there. No one! Not even the colonel!
5391	5392	Yes, sir.
5397	5399	You know, I think this guy Stillman is really dangerous.
5400	5402	Yeah, I'm becoming aware of that, you know.
5404	5407	Okay, leùs go. Leùs load that truck.
5407	5408	Sergeant.
5409	5411	We've traced the EM-50 to Germany.
5411	5413	They're probably heading right for East Berlin.
5413	5416	Sir, if you'll take my advice, there's a crack squad in the 42nd...
5416	5418	...that could link up with Air Recon.
5418	5420	We'd have that EM-50 back here inside of 24 hours.
5421	5423	Nothing doing. We'd be the laughingstock...
5423	5426	...of the entire armed forces. We will do this ourselves.
5426	5428	Sir, those numb-nuts can't even tie their own shoelaces.
5429	5432	I don't care, sergeant. Just load the truck, and leùs move out.
5433	5435	All right, we're moving out! Move!
5437	5439	I guess we're going after John and Russell.
5439	5441	I can't believe they're Russian spies. Can you?
5441	5445	All I know is, I finally get to kill somebody.
5465	5467	Hey, Russell.
5468	5470	Have you been doing your special exercises?
5470	5473	- I brought the magic suitcase. - You did?
5473	5476	Does this do anything for you? French girls do it all the time.
5476	5478	No. I've seen that.
5479	5481	I've seen that on cable TV, and it did nothing for me.
5482	5484	Hey, watch it. A guy could get hurt.
5487	5491	- My gosh, my gosh. - Come on, John.
5491	5493	- Come on. - I'll do it!
5493	5496	But just one more time.
5497	5499	Off the low meter board.
5500	5503	From the United States Military Academy, John Winger.
5504	5506	He's gonna do a reverse mo-fo.
5509	5512	A somersault up to the knees, to a butt banister...
5512	5513	...a backflip...
5513	5515	...all they way back to a double backflip.
5515	5518	A face bounce! A double face bounce!
5518	5521	A triple head! Oh, no! Oh, he's hurt!
5523	5525	That does sound nice.
5525	5527	You know, my father was here during the war.
5527	5530	- In this bathtub? - Your ears need cleaning.
5530	5534	Easy. Louise, what do you think of me?
5535	5539	When we first met, I thought you were kind of screwed up.
5540	5541	And now?
5542	5544	I still think you're kind of screwed up, Russell...
5544	5547	...but you're so cute.
5547	5549	- A face bounce... - John.
5549	5551	...a dismount...
5552	5554	...and a remount.
5554	5555	John!
5557	5559	How's this? How's this?
5559	5561	- How's this for you? - Perfect.
5561	5564	- Is this good? Is this good? - Iùs great. Oh, iùs perfect.
5564	5567	- What about this? How about this? - Thaùs better. Oh, so much better.
5568	5570	Oh, I like that.
5570	5572	Thaùs different.
5576	5580	Oh, where did you learn that? Oh, where did you learn that?
5582	5586	Oh, not yet. Please, not yet! Oh, please!
5586	5589	I can't stop! Please!
5590	5593	Oh, I wanted it... Oh, I'm sorry!
5594	5597	- I can't see a thing up ahead, sir. - The turnoff is just up to the right.
5598	5599	No, sir. If we turn right, we're gonna...
5600	5604	Sergeant, when I want your input, I will ask for it. Thank you.
5652	5654	For chrissakes, captain. We broke through the...
5654	5658	This is my mission. I would appreciate if you let me run it. Thank you.
5661	5662	Fuck this.
5672	5675	- Where you going, sarge? - Hey, sarge, where are you going?
5675	5678	Sarge, what are you doing? Sarge, what are you doing?!
5717	5721	Here you go. There you go. Hand them off there, boys.
5721	5723	Stupid jerks.
5778	5780	Gunther, get yourself a new Volkswagen, huh?
5782	5785	Folks, don't order the schnitzel. They're using schnauzer.
5787	5790	Hey, Hansel, Gretel! Hey, we're your allies.
5790	5792	Iùs cool. All right.
5792	5795	All right, Klaus, hold it up right here.
5795	5798	We got some naked animals in here we don't want you to see.
5798	5799	Here you are.
5802	5803	- More worthless money for you. - Come on.
5804	5806	- All right. - Hey, did you leave the radio on?
5807	5808	- What? - Thaùs the shortwave radio.
5809	5810	This is the EM-50?
5816	5818	Mayday, mayday.
5818	5823	Mayday. Code 21, Status 7. Mayday. Code 21, Status 7.
5823	5825	Code 21. Go ahead.
5825	5829	I'm with the U.S. Army, 41 st Armoured Division, Bravo Company.
5829	5832	I have a platoon and CO being held by hostile enemy...
5832	5837	...at coordinates 416-397.
5837	5840	They're Russian troops, about 200.
5840	5843	Send help. I gotta get moving.
5844	5847	416-397. Thaùs Czechoslovakia.
5849	5852	- Forty-first Armoured? - Yeah, Bravo Company.
5854	5856	- Thaùs our unit. - Oh, no.
5857	5860	- They came looking for us. - Oh, they've had it.
5860	5862	We've had it.
5862	5864	If iùs a Status 7 like you said, they went in undercover.
5865	5867	So the DOD won't even acknowledge it.
5868	5869	Those guys are dead.
5871	5873	- We gotta go get them. - Yeah.
5873	5876	- No. - We're responsible.
5876	5878	- Russell. - Come on, iùs Czechoslovakia.
5878	5880	We zip in, we pick them up and we zip right out again.
5881	5883	We're not going to Moscow. Iùs Czechoslovakia.
5883	5885	Iùs like going into Wisconsin.
5885	5888	I got the shit kicked out of me in Wisconsin once. Forget it.
5890	5893	- Russell, what are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid.
5893	5895	There are two things I promised myself I'd never do:
5896	5897	Kill and die.
5897	5899	What if the Russians were raping your sister?
5899	5903	Come on, you know my sister. You practically raped her one night.
5903	5905	The Russians would just have to buy her dinner.
5905	5909	Russell, that is our platoon out there. Thaùs Ox and Elmo and Cruiser.
5909	5912	I love those guys. We're their only chance.
5913	5915	Two things, John: First of all, they hate your guts.
5916	5917	Those bastards.
5917	5921	Second, when I finish all my training, I'm probably gonna be a typist.
5921	5924	Now, when you invade a hostile foreign nation...
5924	5926	...you don't send your typists in the first wave.
5927	5930	They got guys who like to do that, John. Leùs give them a call, okay?
5933	5934	Okay.
5935	5937	Yeah, we won't go in.
5937	5940	- Okay. - Okay, leùs go.
5940	5942	Oh, my hero.
5944	5947	Damn it, though, we're so close. I'd love to just go take a look.
5947	5951	I mean, the Iron Curtain, iùs gotta look great. I'd love to have a picture of it.
5951	5952	Think we could do that?
5953	5956	Take about an hour. We could drive over, get pictures and come back.
5956	5958	- We'll just look? - Yeah.
5960	5963	- Okay. Leùs look. - Yeah, thaùs a much better plan.
5989	5992	We're so damn lost. Where the hell is Innsbruck, Austria?
5992	5995	We're trying to get over there, do some skiing.
5997	5999	- Do you know Brandy? Hi, girls. - Excuse me.
6000	6002	- What a darling border guard. - Is there a bathroom here?
6003	6005	Bathroom, girls. Bathroom.
6005	6007	There must be a bathroom here somewhere.
6007	6009	Bathroom. Bathroom.
6012	6016	Hi. I'm John Winger of the United States Army...
6016	6018	...and you are my prisoner. - Why are you doing this?
6021	6022	Chicago.
6023	6026	Why do we want prisoners? What do we want with prisoners?
6026	6028	Come on, move!
6033	6035	Do the words "act of war" mean anything to you, huh?
6036	6040	- I have a plan. - Great. Custer had a plan too.
6088	6090	We are in serious trouble.
6090	6093	He said he had a plan. Now, just give him a chance.
6093	6095	Hello, hello!
6107	6110	What an idiot. Get in here.
6118	6120	- All right, we're in. - Nice work, John.
6125	6127	- Whaùs the plan? - I'm working on it.
6127	6130	Oh, my God, what an idiot. He's working on it.
6132	6134	The absence of a plan is ridiculous.
6134	6136	Hey, they're about to start shooting at us.
6136	6139	- Good. Thaùs fine. Let them. - Iùs working.
6148	6151	- Louise, get this thing moving. - You're dangerous, you know that?
6155	6156	Oh, this is interesting.
6162	6165	I got it figured this way: They got one big gun, a couple of tanks.
6166	6169	They got a hundred Baryshnikovs running around.
6169	6171	- And what do we got? - What do we got?
6171	6174	We got one heavily armed recreational vehicle here, man.
6175	6177	Okay, find that truck, and we find them.
6187	6189	- There's a gun in that tower, Russell. - I see him.
6192	6194	All right, steady, steady.
6205	6208	- Got him! - All right! Oh, God!
6211	6213	Good one, Russell.
6215	6218	- There's the truck. - Must be them. Get ready!
6222	6223	Out, please!
6230	6233	John, over here!
6253	6255	- That was stupid. - Yeah.
6259	6260	- You know who would love this? - Who?
6260	6263	Russell. He should be here.
6263	6264	- Russell! - Russell!
6264	6266	Help!
6275	6277	- Thank you. - That helped.
6287	6289	They'd better be in there.
6341	6342	You can beat me as much as you want!
6351	6353	- Are you okay? - Where are they?
6353	6356	- Hi. - Where are the others?
6358	6359	Hello?
6363	6365	Hello!
6365	6367	Hello?
6367	6369	- Hello? - Hello.
6369	6372	- Who is it? - Iùs Idi Amin.
6372	6375	- Iùs Winger! - We're free!
6375	6378	Iùs us, Winger! Get us out!
6378	6380	All right, stand back from the door. I'm gonna blow it.
6380	6382	Everybody back! Everybody back!
6385	6386	Get it.
6389	6390	Get down.
6399	6403	- Whoa, tough door! - You got it locked on the inside?
6403	6407	Iùs because of you people that I cannot get outside!
6407	6410	Iùs always your fault. You are not capable of handling...
6410	6412	To take orders from me, who is...
6412	6416	- Open this door, please! - I'm gonna squash him!
6421	6426	- Winger! Oh, I'm so glad! - What are you doing here?
6443	6446	Look out, Louise! There's a tank behind us! Move it!
6471	6472	Find John, will you? I'm gonna kill him.
6516	6518	We had a car waiting.
6523	6525	Russell?
6563	6565	Leùs get out of here!
6589	6591	We're here!
6593	6594	John!
6594	6596	Come on!
6601	6605	You are in trouble! This is government property...
6651	6653	Something's blocking the road. Hang on!
6653	6654	Hang on!
6657	6660	I'm getting too old for this shit!
6668	6671	Gentlemen, we are in Germany!
6739	6742	Platoon, ten-hut!
6743	6746	Queen Anne salute!
6748	6749	Get up!
6764	6767	Thank you. Iùs great to be back home.
6788	6790	My people, we're number one. All right.
6797	6801	Ox, we got medals. Look. Valortorious Service. Thank you.
6803	6806	What the...? A surprise party!
6807	6810	I'll kill you. Whose idea was this?
6810	6814	All right, everybody's coming to my place. This is ridiculous.
6814	6816	Senator, hang onto that, will you, for me?
6817	6820	Oh, I wrote. I didn't know if you'd come.
6820	6822	No questions, please.
6822	6824	We just want to get back to our hotel rooms...
6824	6827	...and have some really serious sex.
6829	6832	What are you looking at? Keep your eyes out there.
6851	6853	Oh, you old dog.
6888	6891	Right face!
6891	6893	Forward march!
6895	6898	Left, left, Your left, right, left.
6904	6906	Five, six, seven, eight.
