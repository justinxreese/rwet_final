19	22	Hello. My name is Marty DiBergi.
22	25	I'm a filmmaker. I make a lot of commercials.
26	30	That dog that chases the covered wagon underneath the sink? That was mine.
32	34	In 1966,
34	39	I went down to Greenwich Village to a rock club called The Electric Banana.
39	44	Don't look for it. It's not there any more. But that night, I heard a band
44	47	that, for me, redefined the word "rock'n'roll".
48	54	I remember being knocked out by their... their exuberance, their raw power,
54	56	and their punctuality.
56	60	That band was Britain's now legendary Spinal Tap.
61	67	17 years and 15 albums later, Spinal Tap is still going strong.
67	73	And they've earned a place in rock history as one of England's loudest bands.
73	76	So in the late fall of 1982,
76	80	when I heard that Tap was releasing a new album called Smell The Glove
80	84	and was planning a tour of the US to promote that album,
85	88	I jumped at the chance to make the documentary,
89	93	the, if you will, rockumentary that you're about to see.
93	99	I wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells
99	102	of a hard-working rock band on the road.
102	104	And I got that.
104	106	But I got more.
106	108	A lot more.
109	113	But enough of my yakkin'. Whaddaya say? Let's boogie.
123	125	Gives me energy. Makes me happy.
125	126	Heavy metal's deep.
127	129	The way they dress, the leather.
129	134	- Is this La Guardia? - No, this is JFK. New York, New York.
138	140	Watch its mouth!
152	157	It's like you become one with the guys in the band. I mean, there's no division.
157	159	You just...
159	164	The music just unites people... with the players.
164	169	Comin' live, direct from hell... Spinal Tap!
169	173	You're hot, you take all we've got. Not a dry seat in the house
174	176	Next day we'll be on our way
177	179	- But tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
179	182	- Yeah, tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
182	183	Tonight!
188	193	We are Spinal Tap from the UK! You must be the USA!

221	225	Little girl, it's a great big world but there's only one of
227	230	Me!
250	251	Let's talk about your history.
252	258	Nigel, you and David originally started the band back in... when was it, 1964?
258	262	Before that I was in a group called The Creatures-a skiffle group.
262	265	I was in Lovely Lads, and then we looked at each other
265	269	and said we might as well join up, you know?
270	274	So we became The Originals. And we had to change our name.
274	277	There was another group called The Originals
277	281	- And we had to rename ourselves. - The New Originals.
281	285	- Then they became... - They changed back to The Regulars,
285	289	so we could've been The Originals, but what's the point?
289	291	We became The Thames Men at that point.
293	295	Stop wastin' my time
295	297	"POP, LOOK & LISTEN" (British TV - 1965)
297	299	You know what I want
300	302	You know what I need
304	306	Or maybe you don't
307	312	Do I have to come right flat out and tell you everythin'?
312	314	Gimme some money
315	318	Gimme some money
325	327	Your first drummer was...
327	330	- The Peeper. - John "Stumpy" Pepys. Great, great...
330	333	Tall, blond geek with glasses.
335	338	- Good drummer. - Great look. Good drummer.
338	340	- What happened to him? - He died.
340	344	He died in a bizarre gardening accident some years back.
344	346	It was one of those things.
346	349	It was... the authorities said
349	353	best leave it, you know, unsolved, really, you know?
353	357	- And he was replaced by? - Stumpy Joe. Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.
357	359	And what happened to Stumpy Joe?
359	362	Well, it's not a very pleasant story.
362	365	- But, er... he died. - He passed on.
366	372	He choked on... The official explanation was he choked on vomit.
372	377	- And he passed away. - It was actually someone else's vomit.
378	380	There's no real...
380	382	They can't prove whose vomit it was.
382	385	They don't have facilities in Scotland Yard.
385	388	You can't really dust for vomit.
389	391	Here we go.
391	394	- SoHo, they call this. SoHo. - So-what?

401	404	How are you?!
404	407	lan... Hi, fellas!
407	409	How ya doin'?
409	411	I want you to meet everybody.
411	413	- Bobbi Flekman. - Who's that?
413	417	- Bobbi Flekman. - Who is it? With the record company?
418	422	Yes, Bobbi Flekman! The hostess with the mostest!
422	424	You know! You know!
424	427	Hi, handsome. How ya doin'?
427	431	I want you to all meet Sir Denis Eton-Hogg. He's the head of Polymer.
432	435	You don't talk so much. Just smile and look smart.
435	437	Denis, come here! Come here.
437	440	I want you to meet Spinal Tap, our guests of honour.
440	444	- How very nice to meet you. - This is Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.
444	448	- This is Nigel. - Thanks a lot for letting us... er...
448	452	Let's go over here and we'll take a picture.
452	457	Where's my photographer? Come here, honey. What's your name? Christine?
457	459	OK, right over here.
460	462	Good! Good!
462	466	- He's not into Negro music. - No, it's not Negro.
466	470	Guys, you look fantastic. You would never know you're almost 40.
470	473	If I looked this good from the stage, too-it's amazing.
474	475	- I did the bird. - Do the dead bird.
476	477	Get the dwarf cannolies.
478	481	- I did the bird. - Don't talk back. Mime is money. Move it!
482	486	Now, we here at Polymer, we're all looking forward to a long
486	489	and fruitful relationship with Spinal Tap.
489	493	We wish them great success on their North American tour.
493	498	And so say all of us - Tap into America!
503	507	Excuse me. Are you reading Yes, I Can?
507	510	- Yeah. Have you read it? - Yeah. By Sammy Davis, Jr?
510	511	Yeah.
511	513	You know what the title of that book should be?
514	518	Yes, I Can... If Frank Sinatra Says It's OK.
518	520	Cos Frank calls the shots for all those guys.
520	524	Did you get to the part yet where Sammy's comin' outta The Copa,
525	529	and it's about three o'clock in the morning, and he sees Frank.
529	532	Frank's walkin' down Broadway by himself...
534	536	Fuckin' limeys.
537	540	Well, they're not used to that world, and Frank Sinatra.
540	542	It's a different world that they're in.
543	547	You know, it's just people like this, you know... They get all they want,
548	551	so they don't really understand about a life like Frank's.
551	555	You know, when you've loved and lost the way Frank has,
555	557	then you know what life's about.
557	559	The New York Times may do something.
559	561	IAN FAITH Manager, Spinal Tap
561	564	When do we get the album released?
564	566	It doesn't matter how good the press is...
567	571	As I explained last night, we're not gonna saturate the New York market.
572	575	Now, Philly is a real rock'n'roll town.
575	579	The album will be available all through the Philadelphia area.
579	582	So you are hitting that market...
582	585	We're certainly... I'm doing everything I can.
586	588	You know that we're not blaming you.
588	590	But these guys have an effect on an audience.
591	593	Kids go to their concert, have a great time.
593	597	But it's... It's a passing thing. It's, uh...
598	603	I would never tell them this, but this is a... this is a fad.

673	677	I met her on Monday, 'twas my lucky bun day
678	679	You know what I mean
682	686	I love her each weekday, each velvety cheek day
687	688	You know what I mean
691	694	My love gun's loaded and she's in my sights

724	728	Let's talk about your reviews, regarding Intravenus de Milo.
728	732	"This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within."
733	736	"The musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted."
736	740	"They're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
740	742	That's nit-picking.
742	744	The Gospel According To Spinal Tap.
744	748	"This pretentious, ponderous collection of religious rock psalms
748	750	is enough to prompt the question,
750	753	what day did the Lord create Spinal Tap,
753	756	and couldn't he have rested on that day, too?"
757	759	I never heard that one. That's a good one.
759	765	The review on Shark Sandwich, which was merely a two-word review, just said:
765	767	"Shit sandwich."
768	772	- Where did that appear? - That's not real, is it?
772	774	RECORDING INDUSTRY CONVENTION Atlanta, Georgia
774	778	All those arguments about touring... We belong on tour.
778	783	All that stuff about you being too old and being too white...
783	787	What about the album, lan? This is beginning to be a refrain here.
787	791	There's no way to promote something that doesn't exist.
791	795	It's just that they're just experimenting with, er,
796	798	with new packaging materials.
798	801	Experimenting? They got monkeys opening it?
801	804	The other thing is that the Boston gig has been cancelled.
804	808	I wouldn't worry about it. It's not a big college town.
811	813	You boys got an album coming out or anything?
814	816	Smell The Glove. It should be out...
816	819	- Smell The Glove? - Smell The Glove, yeah.
819	822	- Provocative title. - Wait till you see the cover.
823	824	Very provocative indeed.
824	828	Bobbi, can I tear you away from all this?
828	831	- Do you have a drink? - I don't really need one.
831	835	But, um, listen. I really do have to talk to you a bit about this...
836	838	lan, just tell me what's on your mind.
838	840	- The issue of the cover. - Yeah.
840	844	Um... we, er, I mean, we feel, and it seems to be fact,
844	848	that the company's rather down on the cover. Is that the case?
848	850	- Yes. - You can give it to me straight.
850	852	Listen... they don't like the cover.
852	856	- Well, that's straight. - They find it offensive and sexist.
856	858	What do you find offensive?
858	863	lan, you put a greased, naked woman on all fours
864	867	with a dog collar around her neck and a leash,
867	870	and a man's arm extended out up to here
870	875	holding onto the leash and pushing a black glove in her face to sniff it.
875	878	You don't find that offensive and sexist?
878	881	- This is 1982! - That's right, it's 1982.
881	884	We don't have this mentality any more.
884	887	You should've seen the cover they wanted to do!
887	890	This is something you have to talk about.
890	895	- We're not laying down any conditions... - A sexy cover isn't why an album sells.
895	898	You tell me - The White Album? What was that?
899	901	There was nothing on that goddamn cover.
901	904	Excuse me. We'll talk about this after.
905	906	Hello?
907	909	Oh, hi, Denis.
909	913	Uh-uh. OK. Why don't you tell him?
913	918	OK, hold on. Lan, it's Eton-Hogg. He wants to talk to you.
918	922	- OK. Thank you, darling. - You're welcome... dear.
922	924	Hello? Sir Denis!
924	926	Hi. How are you?
929	930	Oh...
931	934	Fuckin' old poofter!
935	939	But it's really not that offensive, Sir Denis! Come on!
939	943	OK. I'll call you absolutely first thing in the morning.
945	948	Oh, shit! They're not gonna release the album,
949	952	because they have decided that the cover is sexist.
952	956	So what? What's wrong with being sexy? I mean, there's no...
956	958	Sex-ist!
958	960	OK, I wanted to tell you this,
960	964	but I didn't know what Denis's decision was going to be.
964	967	But at this point, both Sears and K-Mart stores
967	971	won't handle the album. They're boycotting it because of the cover.
971	975	If the company is behind an album, it can shove it down their throats!
975	978	Money talks and bullshit walks.
978	982	And if the first album was a hit, then we could have told them...
982	987	- Every cut on this album... - I don't give a shit...
987	990	It was a joke and they're making it a big deal.
990	994	If we said she should be forced to smell the glove,
994	998	then you'd have a point. But it's all a joke.
998	1001	- We're making fun of it. - She should be made to smell it.
1001	1004	But not over and over.
1004	1009	We can work something out. I'll talk to Denis and maybe we can compromise.
1009	1011	A new design concept we can all live with.
1011	1016	- You guys were schoolmates? - We... We're not university material.
1016	1018	- What's on your finger? - My gum.
1018	1021	- Why is it on your finger? - I might need it later.
1021	1025	- Put it on the table. It's terrible. - I might forget it on the table.
1025	1029	- Can't take him anywhere! - How old were you guys when you met?
1029	1032	About eight years old. Eight or nine.
1032	1036	- You were eight and I was seven. - That's right.
1036	1040	Do you remember the first song you wrote together?
1040	1041	All The Way Home.
1042	1043	- All The Way Home? - Yeah.
1044	1047	Can you remember it? I'd love to hear it.
1047	1050	Christ! Some black coffee, maybe we could do it.
1050	1052	How's it go?
1053	1056	- I was standin' - Beside the railroad track
1057	1060	And I'm waitin' for that train to bring you back
1060	1062	Bring you back
1064	1067	If she's... If she's not on the 5.19
1067	1070	Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
1070	1073	And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry, all the way home
1074	1077	- All the way home - All the way home
1077	1079	- All the way home - All the way home
1079	1084	- Cry... cry, cry, all the way home. - Cry, cry, cry, all the way home.
1084	1088	There was about six words in it. Just repeating them over and over again.
1088	1090	Let's talk about your music today.
1091	1095	One thing that puzzles me, um, is the make-up of your audience.
1095	1100	It seems to be predominantly young boys.
1100	1102	Well, it's a sexual thing.
1102	1106	Aside from the identifying that the boys do with us,
1106	1110	there's also, like, a reaction of the female to our music.
1110	1112	Really, they're quite fearful.
1112	1116	They see us onstage with tight trousers...
1116	1119	We've got, you know, armadillos in our trousers.
1119	1122	It's really quite frightening, the size.
1122	1124	And... and they run screaming.
1125	1129	VANDERMINT AUDITORIUM Chapel Hill, North Carolina
1129	1132	lan, can I have a word with you?
1132	1134	Yes, of course. What?
1134	1139	There are a couple of problems with the arrangements backstage.
1139	1143	- What exactly? - Well, there are some problems here.
1143	1145	I don't even know where to start.
1145	1148	- Sound check? What? - No, no, no, no. This. Look.
1149	1151	There's a problem with... Look. This.
1151	1156	This miniature bread. I've been working with this for about half an hour.
1156	1160	I can't figure out... Let's say I want a bite, right? You got this...
1161	1163	- You'd like bigger bread? - Exactly! I don't understand...
1164	1165	You could fold this.
1165	1169	- Then it's half the size. - Not the bread. You fold the meat.
1169	1173	- Then it breaks apart like this. - No, you put it on the bread like this.
1174	1177	- But if you fold it, it breaks. - Why fold it?
1177	1179	Everything has to be folded.
1179	1185	And then it's this, and I don't want this. I want large bread, so that I can put this...
1187	1191	So then it's like this, but this doesn't work because it's all...
1191	1193	Because it hangs out?
1193	1197	- Would you hold this? - I wouldn't want to put that in my mouth.
1197	1200	And then we move on to this. Look! Look!
1201	1204	Who's in here? No one. Then in here, there's a little guy.
1205	1206	It's a complete catastrophe!
1207	1210	You're right, Nigel, but calm down, calm down.
1210	1212	- It's no big deal. It's a joke. - I'm sorry.
1212	1215	It's just some cracker university.
1215	1217	I don't want it to affect your performance.
1218	1221	It won't affect my performance. Don't worry.
1221	1226	I just hate it. It does disturb me. But I'll rise above it. I'm a professional.
1231	1234	It's better in a hellhole
1234	1238	You know where you stand in a hellhole
1238	1242	Folks lend a hand in a hellhole
1242	1246	Girl, get me back to my hellhole
1301	1302	Do Stonehenge!
1303	1306	Do you play... Do you actually play all these?
1306	1309	I play them and I cherish them.
1309	1311	This is at the top of the heap.
1311	1314	No question about it. Look at the flame on that one.
1314	1317	It's just... It's quite unbelievable.
1317	1322	This one is just... It's perfect, 1959.
1322	1324	You know, it just... Listen.
1324	1326	- How much... - Just listen.
1326	1330	- The sustain-listen to it. - I'm not hearing anything.
1330	1334	You would if it were playing. Because it's famous for its sustain.
1334	1338	- You can just hold it... - So you don't...
1338	1342	You can go and have a bite and you'd still be hearing that one.
1342	1344	- Can you hold this a sec? - Sure.
1344	1347	This one... This, of course, is a custom three pick-up.
1348	1350	This is my radio unit.
1350	1355	So I strap this piece on right down in here when I'm onstage.
1355	1357	- It's a wireless. - Wireless. Exactly.
1358	1362	- I can play without all the muck. - You can run anywhere onstage with it.
1362	1365	This is special, too. Look, see?
1365	1368	It's still got the tagger on it. Never even played it.
1368	1370	- You just bought it... - Don't touch it.
1370	1372	I wasn't gonna touch it.
1372	1375	- I was just pointing at it. - Don't point.
1375	1378	- Don't even point? - No. It can't be played. Never.
1378	1381	- Can I look at it? - No. You've seen enough.
1381	1383	This is what we use onstage.
1383	1387	But it's very, very special because, if you can see,
1387	1390	the numbers all go to 11.
1390	1394	Look. Right across the board. 11... 11... 11...
1394	1397	- And most amps go up to ten? - Exactly.
1397	1402	- Does that mean it's louder? - Well, it's one louder, isn't it?
1402	1406	It's not ten. See, most blokes are gonna be playing at ten.
1406	1409	You're on ten here, all the way up, all the way up.
1409	1413	You're on ten-where can you go from there? Where?
1413	1415	- I don't know. - Nowhere. Exactly!
1415	1420	If we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?
1420	1422	- Put it up to 11. - Exactly. One louder.
1423	1426	Why don't you make ten louder, make ten the top number,
1426	1429	and make that a little louder?
1431	1432	These go to 11.
1433	1434	Are you Spinal Tap?
1435	1437	- This is Spinal Tap. - Welcome to Memphis.
1437	1441	- Gentlemen, we have a slight problem. - How slight?
1441	1444	- You wanted seven suites. - Seven suites.
1444	1447	He's put you on the 7th floor with one suite.
1447	1450	That's considerably more than minor.
1450	1453	But it's a good-sized room. It's a king leisure.
1454	1457	How are we going to get 14 people in a king leisure bed?
1457	1459	- Don't tempt me, sir. - Have a good time.
1459	1462	- I'll take care of it. - Welcome, gentlemen.
1462	1464	- Very attractive... - Listen to me!
1464	1468	We want these suites. These people are tired. We've a sound check in an hour.
1469	1471	- What's the problem? - Give me a hand, please.
1471	1475	I'll tell you what's wrong. This twisted old fruit here
1475	1478	- Tells me that... - I'm just as God made me, sir.
1478	1481	What's the difference between golf and miniature golf?
1483	1485	Uh-oh, here they come.
1485	1487	Duke! Duke! Would you...
1489	1491	Can I have your autograph?
1491	1494	Duke. It's OK, we know him. It's Spinal Tap.
1494	1496	- David St Hubbins, Spinal Tap. - How ya doin'?
1497	1498	Derek Smalls.
1498	1501	- We gotta get going. - Where are you playin'?
1502	1506	We're doin' the... Enormo Dome. We sold it out.
1506	1509	That's a big place. You sold it out?!
1509	1511	We really should run, you know.
1511	1516	Good heavens! How are you? Great to see you, Ter.
1516	1518	- Um... Liam! - Lan.
1518	1519	lan!
1520	1524	We'd love to chat, but we gotta sit in the lobby and wait for the limo.
1524	1527	- OK. - Great to see you again, Terry.
1527	1530	- Cheers! - Cheers!
1530	1532	Great. Great to see you.
1532	1535	- Good days. Good days. - Nice to see you.
1536	1538	Fuckin' wanker. What a wanker.
1538	1541	He's got this much talent. This much if he's lucky.
1542	1544	We had to apologise for him with our set.
1544	1548	People were still booin' him when we were on. It's all hype.
1548	1552	- We got our rooms. Big fat suites. - Can I ask you something?
1552	1555	Have you seen Duke Fame's current album?
1555	1558	- Um... yes. - You've seen the cover?
1558	1561	- No, I don't think I have. - It's a rather lurid cover.
1561	1564	It's, like, naked women and...
1564	1569	He's tied down to this table and they've got whips and they're all semi-nude.
1570	1573	- What's your point? - It's much worse than Smell The Glove.
1573	1576	He releases that and he's number three.
1576	1581	But he's the victim. Their objections were that she was the victim.
1581	1583	If the singer's the victim, it's not sexist.
1583	1587	- He did a twist on it. - We should've thought of that.
1587	1590	If we'd had you guys tied up, that would've been fine.
1590	1594	It's such a fine line between stupid and...
1594	1597	- And clever. - It's just that turnabout.
1597	1600	I have a piece of bad news. Although it may not be that bad.
1600	1603	We're, er... we're cancelled here.
1604	1607	- At the hotel? - No, the gig is cancelled.
1607	1609	Fuck!
1609	1614	"Memphis show cancelled due to lack of advertising funds."
1614	1620	The last time Tap toured America, they were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas
1620	1624	and 15,000-seat venues. And it seems that now, on the current tour,
1625	1629	they're being booked into 1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.
1629	1634	I was wondering, does this mean the popularity of the group is waning?
1634	1637	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, not at all.
1637	1642	I just think that... that their appeal is becoming more selective.
1644	1646	I notice you got this cricket bat here.
1646	1650	- Do you play? - No. I carry this partly out of...
1650	1653	I don't know. Sort of...
1654	1657	- I suppose... What's the word? - Affectation?
1657	1660	Yes. It's a kind of totemistic thing, you know.
1660	1664	To be frank, it's come in useful in a couple of situations.
1665	1668	Certainly in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock.
1668	1673	Having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is quite often... useful.
1673	1675	I miss you too, darling.
1675	1677	Um, not too well, actually.
1678	1681	We got to Memphis and there's no gig in Memphis.
1681	1685	And we find out this promoter in the Midwest
1685	1688	has pulled out of St Louis and Kansas City,
1688	1691	and, um,
1691	1693	oh, Des Moines.
1693	1695	I don't know. It's in Indiana or something.
1697	1699	I thought...
1700	1703	Oh, don't tease me. That's not until April.
1703	1707	Great! We'll do it! Oh, fuckin' great!
1708	1711	Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
1711	1714	I have no idea. You might have to fly to New York
1714	1717	and then go to Milwaukee from there.
1718	1720	Oh, God, I love you too!
1720	1722	OK. Bye.
1724	1729	Well, my problems are solved, mate. Jeanine, she's gonna come meet us.
1729	1735	She was supposed to do this window layout for Neil Khyatt's boutique, but...
1735	1739	- Is she coming to drop some stuff off? - No, she's coming on the road.
1739	1742	She's gonna travel with us. She's gonna go on the road with us.
1742	1746	She says she can hear that I'm eating too much sugar on the phone.
1746	1748	She says my larynx is fat.
1748	1753	You might want to come next door. The radio's playing a bit of your past.
1754	1756	Are you happy for me?
1761	1764	- I don't believe it! - Just have a listen, man.
1768	1772	How sad it must end but I'm glad I've a friend
1772	1775	Sharing cups and cakes with me
1775	1780	And cakes with me
1781	1784	Oh, yeah! Goin' all the way back to 1965!
1784	1789	Doesn't it feel good with The Thames Men and "Cups & Cakes"?
1789	1794	The Thames Men later became Spinal Tap and had a couple of nice-sized hits.
1794	1797	They're currently in the "Where Are They Now?" file.
1797	1800	Johnny Q with you on Golden 106, and right after we...
1802	1805	I'm not sure this was a good idea. I don't feel any better.
1805	1807	GRACELAND Memphis, Tennessee
1809	1812	He was gonna do a TV special from here before he died.
1812	1816	Yeah, a musical version of Somebody Up There Likes Me.
1819	1821	Well, since my baby left me
1822	1824	I found a new place to dwell
1825	1827	Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
1827	1831	At Heartbreak Hotel
1831	1833	- Do it with the harmony parts. - All right.
1833	1835	Well, since my baby
1835	1837	The same key, though, I think.
1838	1840	Well, since my baby left me
1840	1844	If I'm going: Since my baby left me
1844	1847	- Me - No, you can't hit that note.
1848	1851	Since my baby left me
1851	1854	Well, I found a new place to dwell
1854	1857	- That's all right. - Not really.
1857	1861	- It sounds raga. You don't wanna go raga. - Not with this, it don't.
1861	1864	- Since my baby left me - It sounds fuckin' barbershop.
1864	1867	- Barbershop raga. - Watch the language.
1867	1870	- You're in the presence of the King. - Oh. Sorry.
1872	1874	This is thoroughly depressing.
1874	1877	Really puts a perspective on things, doesn't it?
1877	1881	Too much. There's too much fuckin' perspective now.
1881	1886	In 1967, that was the first time Spinal Tap came into existence.
1886	1888	The whole world was changing in those days.
1889	1893	We had the world's ear because we had just released an enormous-selling single.
1893	1896	- Listen To The Flower People. - Flower People.
1896	1898	We toured the world. We toured the States.
1898	1901	- Toured the world and elsewhere. - A dream come true.
1901	1906	Listen to what the flower people say
1906	1910	"JAMBOREEPOP" (American TV - 1967)
1910	1917	Listen, it's getting louder every day
1919	1925	Listen, it's like a bolt out of the blue
1928	1934	Listen, it could be calling out for you
1953	1956	In the Flower People period, who was your drummer?
1956	1958	Stumpy's replacement, Peter "James" Bond.
1958	1961	He also died in mysterious circumstances.
1961	1965	We were playing a jazz blues festival. Where was that?
1965	1968	- Blues jazz, really. - Blues jazz festival.
1968	1970	That was in the Isle...
1970	1972	The Isle of Lucy jazz and blues festival.
1973	1977	And it was tragic, really. He exploded onstage.
1978	1979	- Just like that. - He just went up.
1980	1982	He just was like a flash of green light...
1983	1988	- And that was it. Nothing was left. - It's true. This really did happen.
1988	1991	There was a little green globule on his drum seat.
1991	1994	- Like a stain, really. - More of a stain than a globule.
1994	1999	You know, several... dozens of people spontaneously combust each year.
1999	2002	It's just not really widely reported.
2002	2004	SHANK HALL Milwaukee, Wisconsin
2004	2006	Testing!
2006	2008	Test, test, test. This is mike number one.
2008	2011	This is mike number one. Isn't this a lot of fun?
2011	2013	OK, he's got the mikes.
2013	2016	Let's do GSM, all right? GSM.
2019	2021	Stop wastin' my time
2022	2024	You know what I want
2025	2026	Heavy up!
2026	2029	You know what I n-n-n-need
2030	2033	Or maybe you don't
2035	2040	Or do I have to come right smack-dab out and tell you everythin'
2040	2043	Gimme some money!
2044	2047	Gimme some money!
2047	2049	Oh, yeah
2055	2057	Hello, darling!
2057	2059	Hello! I've got a surprise for you!
2060	2063	- Where'd you come from? - Where do you think I came from?
2064	2067	The bloody aeroplane, didn't I? Right?
2069	2070	David?
2070	2073	David? David?
2073	2075	David?
2075	2077	Oh, that feels good!
2077	2081	Oh, I've been wanting to do that for a long time!
2082	2085	- Want me to carry it about with me? - What's all this?
2086	2089	That's the film crew. I told you about this.
2089	2093	- Martin, this is Jeanine. - Hello.
2094	2097	Here it is! Here it is, lads!
2098	2100	Smell The Glove, me old beauties!
2100	2102	Gather round. Where's David?
2103	2104	David! David, get up here!
2105	2109	David, Smell The Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.
2109	2111	The moment we've all been waiting for!
2112	2115	- I never thought I'd see the day. - Plenty for everybody!
2117	2119	- What do you think? - Is this the test pressing?
2119	2121	No, this is it.
2121	2126	- This is Smell The Glove by Spinal Tap? - That's the jacket cover
2126	2130	- That's going out across the country. - This is the compromise you made?
2130	2133	- Is it going to say anything here? - Nope, it's not gonna say anything.
2133	2137	- So it's just gonna be all black? - Simple, beautiful, classic.
2137	2142	It does look like black leather. You can see yourself in both sides.
2143	2145	It's like a black mirror.
2145	2148	I think it looks like death. It looks like mourning.
2148	2153	Every movie in every cinema is about death. Death sells.
2153	2157	I think he's right. There's something about this that is so black,
2157	2162	it's, like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is... none. None...
2163	2168	You're rationalising this whole thing like it's something you did on purpose.
2168	2172	I think we're stuck with a very stupid and dismal-looking album.
2172	2177	It's something you wear around your arm. You don't put it on your fuckin' turntable!
2177	2183	This is the turning point, OK? I think this is... We're on our way now.
2183	2185	It's time... It's time to kick arse.
2218	2222	When there was darkness and the void was king
2222	2225	And ruled the elements
2225	2228	When there was silence, and the hush
2229	2232	Was almost deafening
2235	2239	- Out of the emptiness - Salvation
2239	2241	Salvation
2242	2245	Rhythm and light and sound
2246	2249	'Twas a rock'n'roll creation
2249	2252	'Twas a terrible big bang
2252	2256	It was the ultimate mutation
2256	2259	Yin was searching for his Yang
2259	2264	And he looked and he saw that it was good
2275	2281	I look to the stars and the answer is clear
2282	2289	I look in the mirror and see what I fear
2305	2308	'Tis the rock'n'roll creation
2308	2311	'Tis the absolute rebirth
2312	2315	It is the rolling of the ocean
2315	2318	And the rocking of the earth
2318	2323	And I looked and I saw that it was good
2347	2351	Given the history of Spinal Tap drummers in the past,
2351	2354	do you have any fears, uh... for your life?
2355	2357	When I did join, they did tell me.
2357	2361	They took me aside and said, "Mick, you know, it's like this."
2361	2366	And it did kind of freak me out a bit,
2366	2369	but it can't always happen to every... Can it?
2370	2372	The law of averages says you will survive.
2373	2373	Yeah.
2377	2380	Whoa, quite exciting.
2380	2383	Quite exciting, this computer magic.
2384	2389	- How many planets have you destroyed? - About four for a fifth time round, I think.
2389	2392	We're doing really fine. A few galaxies gone, you know.
2395	2399	- This is Cindy's first moustache. - Is it?
2400	2402	- Can I take it off now? - Why, are you too hot in it?
2403	2407	No, it's... I thought I might go back and see what they were up to.
2407	2411	I don't think they need to see this until you're finished with it, you know?
2411	2413	You were reading. You can read here.
2414	2416	Yeah, but they got the new game back there.
2417	2420	I thought I could maybe have a look at the new game.
2420	2424	- It's like a submarine thing. - You've got stuff over you again.
2424	2428	Before I met Jeanine, my life was a shambles.
2428	2433	I was using whatever Eastern philosophy happened to drift through my transom.
2434	2439	And she sort of sorted it out for me. Gave me a path, you know, to follow.
2440	2443	Do you have as much influence over his musical expression?
2443	2449	Oh, yeah. I mean, I listen to him when he's experimenting-don't I?
2449	2453	He plays things to me sometimes when he's worked out...
2453	2456	He's got a new bit he wants to tell me about.
2456	2460	And I say that's good or that's bad or that's shit or whatever.
2462	2464	She's very honest. She's brutally frank.
2465	2468	How does that go over with the other band members?
2468	2472	She gives me the brutally frank version, and I sort of tart it up for them.
2473	2476	It's so strange because Nigel
2476	2482	and Jeanine are so similar in so many ways, but they just can't...
2482	2484	They don't dislike each other.
2484	2486	- There's great love between them. - Oh, yes.
2487	2491	But there's some sort of communication that's just blocked or something.
2507	2509	- It's pretty. - Yeah, I like it.
2510	2513	Been foolin' about with it for a few months now.
2513	2515	Very delicate.
2515	2519	It's a bit of a departure from the kind of thing you normally play.
2519	2522	Yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really.
2522	2525	A musical trilogy that I'm doing
2525	2531	in D... minor, which I always find is really the saddest of all keys, really.
2531	2535	I don't know why but it makes people weep instantly if you play it.
2537	2540	- It's a horn part. - It's very pretty.
2543	2546	You know, just simple lines, intertwining.
2546	2550	Very much like... I'm really influenced by Mozart and Bach.
2550	2553	And it's sort of in between those, like a Mach piece.
2553	2555	What do you call this?
2555	2558	This piece is called Lick My Love Pump.
2564	2567	Do you have any metal objects in your pockets?
2567	2570	- Yeah. - Put them in the bucket.
2570	2573	Coins... keys...
2576	2578	Tuning fork.
2578	2581	Musician. I have to stay in tune, you know?
2585	2586	Oh. OK.
2586	2592	- Could you take this jacket off, please? - Oh, it's the zipper. Sets off the machine.
2592	2594	Let's go, hurry up!
2598	2600	Step over here, please.
2600	2602	Raise your arms.
2602	2608	Departure at gate 12 has been delayed for approximately 20 minutes.
2622	2626	- Do you have artificial plates or limbs? - Not really, no.
2627	2629	Would you, um...
2647	2649	I don't need a woman
2649	2652	I won't take me no wife
2654	2658	I got the rock'n'roll and that'll be my life
2662	2667	No page in history, baby, that I don't need
2668	2672	I just wanna make some eardrums bleed
2674	2676	- Heavy - Heavy
2676	2678	- Duty - Duty
2678	2681	Heavy duty rock'n'roll
2687	2688	- Heavy - Heavy
2688	2690	- Duty - Duty
2690	2696	Brings out the duty in my soul
2722	2724	CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
2728	2731	Hi. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records. How are you?
2731	2734	- How you doing? You are... Derek. - Derek.
2735	2737	Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
2737	2740	I'm your promo man here in Chicago. I love you guys.
2740	2744	And, of course, Nigel. I love you. Nigel Tufnel.
2744	2746	I love your stuff. I go back with you guys.
2746	2748	Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
2748	2751	- And who are you, darlin'? - This is my special new friend, Cindy.
2751	2753	- Hello, Cindy. - And this is Belinda.
2753	2756	Hello, Belinda. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
2756	2761	And I... Oh, what's going on here? Hi! Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
2761	2764	Nice to see you. And where is David?
2764	2768	David, hi! Artie Fufkin. How are you? Nice to see you.
2768	2772	- We've got something happening... - It's the food! It's the food!
2772	2776	Oh! Thank God! Civilisation! Where do I put this?
2803	2807	What are you doin' to me here? I thought we had a relationship. What happened?
2807	2810	Business is terrible. What can I tell you?
2810	2814	A record store with a promotion and nobody shows up?
2814	2816	This isn't a personal thing.
2816	2819	Forget personal thing. We had a relationship.
2819	2821	What about our relationship?
2823	2826	I feel like a schlub. I don't know what's happening.
2826	2829	It's me, that's what is happening. It's me.
2829	2830	I did it. It's my fault.
2831	2833	We were told massive radio support.
2833	2837	We did! We did massive. We saturated. We over-saturated.
2837	2840	It's me. I did it. I fucked up.
2840	2844	I fucked up the timing, that's all. I got no timing. I got no timing.
2844	2847	- You know what I want you to do? - What?
2847	2850	Do me a favour. Just kick my ass, OK?
2850	2852	Kick this ass.
2852	2855	Kick my ass. Enjoy. Come on!
2855	2857	I'm not asking, I'm telling with this. Kick my ass.
2860	2864	XANADU STAR THEATER Cleveland, Ohio
2870	2873	We've kept 'em waitin' long enough. Let's do it.
2873	2876	Come on, Mick!
2876	2879	- Let's go, Mr Shrimpton! - Rock'n'roll!
2879	2881	Rock'n'roll!
2884	2885	Let's have some rock'n'roll!
2886	2888	Rock'n'roll! Let's go, then.
2892	2895	- It's gonna be a hot one. - It's gonna be great.
2895	2898	- Not an exit. - We don't want an exit.
2898	2900	- No, that's true. - This way.
2900	2903	Yeah, this way. Let's go.
2907	2908	Um...
2908	2912	- Wait. This looks familiar, though. - Listen!
2916	2918	Shit!
2920	2922	Let's not lose it, let's not lose it.
2922	2924	Where the fuck is lan? He should be here.
2924	2926	Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!
2927	2931	We've gotta get to it some way. We've been onstage, right?
2932	2936	We're in the group. We're in the group that's playin' tonight.
2936	2941	You go straight through this door here, down the hall, turn right,
2941	2945	and then there's a little jog, about 30 feet. Jog to the left.
2945	2949	- We don't have time for that. - Go straight ahead,
2949	2951	turn right at the next two corners.
2951	2955	On the first door is a sign: "authorised personnel only".
2955	2957	- Open that door. That's the stage. - You think so?
2957	2960	You're authorised. You're musicians, aren't ya?
2960	2962	Thank you. Thank you very much.
2962	2964	Rock'n'roll!
2964	2965	Rock'n'roll!
2966	2968	Let's get it! Let's get it!
2968	2970	- This way? - No, this way.
2970	2972	Straight through. Rock'n'roll!
2973	2976	Hello, Cleveland! Hello, Cleveland!
2978	2981	- Fuck! - You must've made a wrong turn.
2982	2987	- We gotta go another way. - Other way, other way. Other way!
2988	2992	I hate to keep harping on, but the notion of a black album has cursed us.
2992	2996	We're getting substantial reports of airplay. Don't worry about that.
2996	3001	But... it might have been better if the, uh... album had been mixed right.
3001	3005	Well, no use crying over that, but of course that's true.
3005	3007	Well, it was mixed all wrong, wasn't it?
3007	3010	It was mixed wrong? Were you there?
3010	3015	- But she's heard the record. - So your judgment is it was mixed wrong.
3015	3018	- You couldn't hear the lyrics. - You don't agree?
3019	3021	- No, I do not agree. - Well, I think maybe...
3021	3025	- It's interesting she's bringing it up. - She'd like to hear the vocals.
3025	3029	It's like me saying you're using the wrong conditioner for your hair.
3029	3032	It looks sort of frizzy.
3032	3036	- You don't do 'eavy metal in Dubly. - In what? In what?
3039	3043	- In Dubly. You can't... - She means Dolby, all right?
3043	3045	You know what she means.
3045	3048	You shan't recover from this one.
3048	3053	Can I have the floor for just one moment? I've got something I'd like to show you.
3054	3057	Jeanine's been working on these very hard.
3057	3061	- These are a new direction... - A new presentation.
3061	3064	The stage look of the band, based on the signs of the zodiac.
3064	3066	We need a new presentation.
3066	3072	This is a look for Viv. He's a Libra. There's the sort of Yin/Yang sort of look.
3072	3075	This is Nigel. He's Capricorn.
3076	3078	- Sort of a goat look. - With a beard.
3078	3080	- Is this a joke? - This...
3080	3084	- Excuse me. Is this a joke? - Just bear with us for one moment.
3084	3087	This... I love this. I wish I were Cancer.
3087	3090	- That's attractive. - This is your crab face.
3090	3091	Give it a chance.
3092	3095	- And this is... - David, wait, please. Wait a minute.
3095	3101	Have you any idea what it will cost to dress up the band as animals?
3101	3104	- Oh, it don't cost nothin'. - They're not animals...
3104	3108	It's a way to fight the drabs. We've got the drabs.
3108	3112	That's true. I think mine would look better in Dubly. If it was done in Dubly...
3112	3114	Shut up!
3114	3118	- If you're not open-minded enough... - David...
3118	3120	There are solutions to our problems.
3120	3124	- I think we know what they are. - I've yet to hear them.
3124	3127	We can take a rational approach. We can say...
3127	3131	- May I make a suggestion? - Oh, let's hear your suggestion.
3131	3134	Stonehenge. Stonehenge.
3134	3136	Best production value we've ever had.
3136	3140	But we haven't got the equipment. We haven't got Stonehenge.
3140	3142	Please, please. Just a moment.
3142	3146	- Musically, we all know it. - It's not a bad idea.
3146	3150	No problems musically. We go right onstage and it's quite simple.
3151	3153	lan can take care of this.
3153	3157	But we don't have that piece of scenery any more.
3157	3159	I know! So we build a new one.
3160	3164	- And this is it. - Consider it done.
3164	3168	You're just gonna take care of it like that? Using that as the plans?
3168	3171	- Let's try. - If you can do it, I'll do the number.
3171	3174	Do you feel that, in collaboration with David,
3174	3179	that you are afforded the opportunity to express yourself musically
3179	3182	- The way you would like to? - Well, I think I do, in my solos.
3182	3184	My solos are my trademark.
3231	3234	Perfect. It's the right proportions.
3234	3236	- It'll be this colour, right? - Yeah.
3236	3239	That's just terrific. It almost looks like the real thing.
3239	3241	- You got it. - Yeah.
3241	3243	When we get the actual set,
3243	3247	it'll follow exactly these specifications? Even these contours?
3247	3251	Um... I don't understand you. The actual piece?
3251	3256	- When you build the actual piece... - But this is what you asked for, isn't it?
3256	3258	- What? - Well, this is the piece.
3258	3261	- This is the piece? - Yes.
3261	3266	Are you telling me that this is it? This is scenery?
3266	3268	Have you ever been to Stonehenge?
3268	3272	The triptychs are 20 feet high! You can stand four men up 'em!
3272	3276	lan, I was asked to build it 18 inches high!
3276	3279	Look. This is what I was asked to build.
3279	3283	18 inches. Right here. It's specified, 18 inches.
3283	3286	- I was given this napkin. - Forget this! Fuck the napkin!
3291	3294	In ancient times,
3295	3299	hundreds of years before the dawn of history,
3301	3304	lived an ancient race of people.
3306	3308	The Druids.
3318	3321	No one knows who they were
3323	3324	or
3325	3327	what they were doing.
3328	3331	But their legacy remains.
3332	3334	Hewn
3335	3337	into the living rock
3338	3340	of Stonehenge.
3352	3355	Stonehenge-where the demons dwell
3355	3359	Where the banshees live and they do live well
3359	3362	Stonehenge-where a man is a man
3362	3366	And the children dance to the pipes of Pan
3371	3373	And you, my love
3373	3375	Won't you take my hand
3377	3379	We'll go back in time
3380	3383	To that mystic land
3385	3388	Where the dewdrops cry
3388	3390	And the cats meow
3391	3394	I will take you there
3395	3398	I will show you how
3415	3418	And, oh, how they danced,
3418	3421	the little children of Stonehenge,
3421	3426	beneath the haunted moon,
3426	3429	for fear that daybreak
3429	3432	might come too soon.
3454	3458	The problem wasn't that the band was down. The problem may have been
3459	3464	that there was a Stonehenge monument in danger of being crushed... by a dwarf.
3465	3469	All right? That tended to understate the hugeness of the object.
3469	3474	- You're making too big a thing out of it. - Making a big thing was the idea.
3474	3476	Nigel gave me a drawing that said 18 inches.
3477	3477	I know...
3478	3482	Whether he knows the difference between feet and inches is not my problem.
3482	3487	But you're not as confused as him. It's not your job to be as confused as Nigel is.
3487	3491	It's my job to do what I'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
3491	3494	- The audience were laughing. - So it became a comedy number.
3494	3499	Yes, it fuckin' did, and it was not pleasant to be part of the comedy onstage.
3499	3501	Backstage, perhaps it was very amusing.
3501	3505	Maybe we just fix the choreography, keep the dwarf clear.
3506	3508	- What do you mean? - So he won't trod upon it.
3508	3512	That's not the issue. I think it's symptomatic of taking on more
3512	3516	than you can, er... er... handle.
3516	3519	It's not the first time you've messed things up, is it?
3519	3524	There have been some gaping holes in the business end...
3524	3528	Excuse me. This is a band meeting, right? Are you here for some reason?
3529	3532	- She's with me. - Is she now in the band?
3532	3534	I care what happens to the band.
3534	3539	David, whenever a single ruffle comes into this adolescent fantasy world
3539	3541	you guys have built around yourself,
3542	3545	you start screaming like a bunch of poncey hairdressers!
3545	3548	It's just a problem! It gets solved!
3548	3554	It doesn't! If it got solved, that would be all right, but it doesn't get solved.
3554	3557	I mean, what got solved tonight?
3557	3561	For one single thing that goes wrong, a hundred things go right.
3561	3563	Do you know what I spend my time doing?
3564	3567	I sleep two or three hours a night. There's no sex and drugs for lan, David.
3568	3570	You know what I do? I find lost luggage.
3570	3572	I locate mandolin strings in the middle of Austin.
3573	3575	I prise the rent out of the local Hebrews.
3575	3578	Get someone else to find luggage,
3578	3581	and you concentrate on the stage.
3581	3585	- You'd like me to be road manager? - No! All bad blood aside...
3585	3589	What Dave is trying to say, if you'd let him get a word through,
3589	3594	- Is you could maybe do with some help. - Some help?
3594	3597	- Managing the band. - It's very simple.
3597	3601	Maybe there's someone already here... We don't have to pay insurance.
3601	3605	We don't have to pay extra room... since she's already here, among us,
3605	3610	- And she's capable of taking over. - "She"? Wait a minute.
3610	3612	Who do you think I'm talking about?
3612	3615	I would never have dreamed it was her you were talking about.
3615	3618	I am offering to help out here.
3618	3621	You're offering to co-manage the band with me.
3621	3623	Yes, that is exactly it.
3624	3628	I'm not gonna co-manage with some girl just cos she's your girlfriend!
3628	3633	Oh! "Girlfriend", is it? I don't know what you're doing managing the band!
3633	3635	- Why don't we just... - Shut up!
3635	3640	This is my position. I am not managing it with you or any other woman.
3640	3644	Especially one who dresses like an Australian's nightmare. So fuck you!
3644	3648	Fuck all of you! Because I quit, all right? That's it. Good night.
3658	3662	Can I raise a practical question at this point?
3662	3664	Are we gonna do Stonehenge tomorrow?
3664	3667	No, we're not gonna fuckin' do Stonehenge!
3667	3670	OK, we're all set. Thank you.
3670	3676	All right, fellas. I got the tickets. We're on the 3.10 flight at gate 24, all right?
3676	3681	It arrives at 4 o'clock in Colorado. Then we got a limo to take us to the Lodge.
3681	3684	It's about 100 yards from Rainbow Trout Studio.
3684	3689	What I've done is to arrange a whole load of charts.
3689	3694	- This is so great. - We know that the band's sign is Virgo.
3694	3699	You see, Saturn's in the third house, and it's a bit rocky.
3699	3705	But because Virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,
3705	3708	we're gonna pull through this with great aplomb.
3708	3710	Has someone not got one?
3710	3715	Nigel hasn't got one. Nigel! Nigel! We got pages for you here.
3716	3718	He's got one. He's got it.
3718	3721	Think what a jumble a tour book usually is...
3721	3723	- He's got one. - Right.
3724	3727	What I want to explain to you is that Denver...
3728	3732	How would you characterise your relationship with David over the years?
3732	3735	- Has it changed in any way? - Not really.
3735	3740	I mean, you know, we've grown up... but really it's not...
3740	3745	No, not really. We feel like children much of the time,
3745	3747	even when we're playing.
3747	3750	We're closer than brothers.
3750	3752	Brothers always fight.
3753	3756	Sort of... disagreements and all that.
3756	3760	We really have a relationship that's way, way past that.
3766	3769	- He can't play any more. - You know the parts.
3769	3772	If he knew the fuckin' part, he'd play it, wouldn't he?
3773	3777	- Are you walking out? Great! - Just tell me what we're supposed to do.
3778	3780	We're supposed to play the fuckin' thing!
3780	3783	- We've spent an hour and a half... - I'm doing my part!
3783	3787	You know what would make this a lot simpler? I hate to cut right to it here.
3787	3792	Why don't you play this alone, without some angel hanging over your head?
3792	3795	Jesus Christ! This is fuckin' all we need.
3795	3799	You can't fuckin' concentrate because of your fuckin' wife!
3799	3801	- It's your fuckin' wife! - She's not my wife.
3801	3805	Whatever the fuck she is, we can't fuckin' do the track!
3805	3809	- This is unbelievable! - No, it's not unbelievable at all!
3809	3813	Am I losing my fuckin' mind?! Could you check me on this?
3814	3816	I don't understand what this has to do with anything!
3816	3821	We're very lucky, in a sense, that we've got two visionaries in the band.
3822	3824	David and Nigel are both like...
3825	3828	Like poets, like Shelley or Byron or people like that.
3829	3832	They're two totally distinct types of visionaries.
3832	3834	It's like fire and ice, basically.
3834	3838	I feel my role in the band is to be kind of in the middle of that,
3838	3840	kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.
3846	3848	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
3848	3853	There's no time to go to the hotel. You'd better go straight to the base.
3853	3855	- Base? - The gig.
3855	3858	- To the Civic Arena, right? - No.
3858	3864	Wait a second. Hold it. Do you know about this and we don't know about this?
3865	3868	- We're going to the air-force base. - Why go to an air-force base?
3868	3871	Because the original gig fell through!
3875	3878	- Lieutenant Hookstrat? - Hookstratten.
3878	3882	- You are Spinal Tarp? - I'm Jeanine and this is Spinal Tap.
3882	3887	Spinal Tap. I'm Bob Hookstratten. Welcome to Lindbergh Air Force Base.
3887	3890	Is this your first visit to a military facility?
3890	3893	May I start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here.
3893	3897	We are such fans of your music and all of your records.
3897	3900	Not yours personally, but the whole genre of rock'n'roll
3900	3903	and the exciting things in music today.
3903	3907	Let me explain what's going on. This is our monthly at ease weekend.
3908	3912	It gives us a chance to let down our hair, although I see you have a head start!
3912	3915	These haircuts wouldn't pass military muster!
3915	3917	My hair's getting a little shaggy, too.
3918	3922	Better not get too close. They'll think I'm in the band! I'm joking, of course.
3923	3926	Walk this way, please. Right through here.
3926	3931	Did you ever run into a group, works out of Kansas City - Four Jacks And A Jill?
3931	3938	If you're ever there and wanna hear some good music, you might wanna drop by.
3938	3943	I would like to get the playing on about 1900 hours, if that's satisfactory.
3944	3947	- When would that be? - I make it now... it's about 1830 hours.
3948	3950	- So that's what? 50 hours? - 120 hours?
3951	3954	That's actually about 30 minutes... give or take a few minutes.
3954	3958	I don't wanna rush you. The idea is we can get it on and we get it over with.
3958	3962	And would you play a couple of slow numbers so I can dance?
3962	3964	Working on a sex farm
3966	3969	Ploughing through your bean field
3971	3973	Gettin' out my pitchfork
3975	3977	Pokin' your hay
3979	3983	Sex farm woman, I'm gonna mow you down
3983	3987	Sex farm woman, I'll rake and hoe you down
3988	3992	Sex farm woman, don't you see my silo risin' high?
3992	3994	High, high, high
3995	3997	Hi-i-i-i-gh...
4017	4019	Working on a sex farm
4022	4025	Tryin' to raise some hard love
4026	4029	Gettin' out my pitchfork
4037	4041	He totally ruined the gig there. He walks off and then...
4041	4046	He can't sit at home and get money. We gotta get someone else in there.
4046	4049	Has he done this before? Has he quit the band before?
4049	4053	No, but you gotta understand that, in the world of rock'n'roll,
4053	4057	there are certain changes that sometimes occur.
4057	4060	And you've just got to sort of roll with them.
4060	4065	You saw exactly how many people have been in this band over the years.
4065	4067	37 people have been in this band over the years.
4068	4071	I mean, six months from now, I can't see myself missing Nige
4072	4075	any more than I might miss Ross McLachness
4075	4079	or Ronnie Pudding or Danny Uppam or Danny Schindler or any of those.
4079	4086	I can't believe that. I can't believe that you're lumping Nigel in with
4087	4089	the people you played with for a short time.
4089	4094	Well, I'd feel much worse if I weren't under such heavy sedation, but
4094	4097	you've gotta be realistic about this sort of thing.
4098	4100	So what happens to the band now?
4101	4103	- What do you mean? - He's not coming back or...
4103	4106	No. We shan't work together again.
4109	4114	THEMELAND AMUSEMENT PARK Stockton, California
4115	4116	- Oh, no. - Great.
4116	4120	If I told them once, I told them a hundred times
4120	4123	to put Spinal Tap first and Puppet Show last.
4124	4126	It's a morale builder, isn't it?
4126	4129	You got a big dressing room... You got a big dressing room.
4129	4132	A bigger dressing room than the puppets? That's refreshing.
4133	4136	I've got some of this Mendocino rocket fuel that's supposed to be really nice.
4136	4140	Can you play... Excuse me, Viv. Can you play a bass line
4140	4143	like Nigel used to on Big Bottom?
4143	4146	Can you double that? You remember it? It's in fifths.
4146	4148	Oh, yeah, yeah. I got two hands here.
4148	4152	- So we can play that one. - Hole is out, Heavy is out.
4153	4155	Right, right, right, right.
4155	4158	America we can't do. It's Nigel's tune. It's not my tune.
4158	4162	- That's a nice, cosy ten-minute set. - What are we gonna do?
4162	4165	- We got nothing to play. - I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
4165	4168	- What? - Jazz Odyssey.
4168	4175	We're not about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
4176	4181	You are witnesses at the new birth of Spinal Tap, Mark 2.
4184	4187	Hope you enjoy our new direction.
4207	4211	On the bass - Derek Smalls. He wrote this.
4218	4220	END OF TOUR PARTY Los Angeles
4220	4223	So tonight's the last show of the tour.
4223	4226	Is this your last waltz? Are we talking the end of Spinal Tap
4226	4229	or are you gonna try to milk it for a few more years in Europe?
4230	4235	Well, I don't really think that the end... can be assessed... er...
4235	4238	as of itself as being the end.
4238	4241	What does the end feel like? It's like saying when you try
4241	4244	to extrapolate the end of the universe.
4244	4248	If the universe is indeed infinite, then what does that mean?
4248	4252	How far is all the way? And then if it stops, what's stopping it?
4252	4257	And what's behind what's stopping it? "What's the end?" is my question to you.
4258	4260	- It's a good crowd, good crowd. - It is, isn't it?
4260	4263	Yeah. Some of these things, you know, don't mean much.
4263	4268	It's hard to get at the last minute. You can't arrange it all overnight.
4268	4270	David, we had a 15-year ride, mate.
4270	4274	Who wants to be a 45-year-old rock'n'roller farting around
4274	4277	in front of people less than half their age,
4277	4281	cranking out some mediocre head-banging bullshit we've forgotten?
4281	4285	- It's beneath us. Who wants to see that? - Absolutely right.
4285	4289	We can take all those projects we didn't have time for.
4289	4294	We didn't have time because of Tap. Bring 'em back to life, maybe.
4294	4296	- Do you remember what... - At the Luton Palace,
4297	4301	we were talking about a rock musical based on the life of Jack the Ripper.
4301	4304	- Yeah. Saucy Jack. - Now is the time to do that.
4304	4306	- You're a naughty one - Saucy Jack
4306	4309	You're a haughty one, Saucy Jack
4309	4312	It's a freeing up, innit? It's all this free time.
4312	4315	- Suddenly time is so elastic. - It's a gift. A gift of freedom.
4315	4319	I've always wanted to do a collection of my acoustic numbers
4319	4322	with the London Philharmonic, as you know.
4322	4326	We're lucky. People should be envying us, you know.
4326	4329	- I envy us. - Yeah. Me too.
4336	4339	It's gonna be fine, right?
4340	4343	- We'll make 'em miss us. - Nice thought.
4345	4348	I'm in. I'm in tune.
4348	4352	- The last tuning. - I think we should go in.
4352	4354	I think it's time to go, right?
4355	4357	- Wanna go? - Yeah.
4358	4362	We're gonna do Reach Out When You Die In My Champagne.
4377	4379	Come to see the show?
4380	4383	- Yeah. Hello, mate. - Nige.
4387	4391	So did you just come here to hang around backstage?
4391	4394	- Is that what you're doin'? - I'm really a messenger.
4394	4398	- Oh, a messenger. - Yeah. I bumped into lan and, er...
4398	4399	lan?
4399	4401	Oh, the other dead man, yeah.
4402	4407	Seems that Sex Farm is on the charts in Japan.
4407	4409	Spinal Tap's recording of Sex Farm?
4410	4413	It was at number five last week, actually.
4413	4416	So he asked me
4417	4421	to ask you, Tap,
4421	4424	if you'd be interested in re-forming
4424	4427	and, er... doing a tour. Japan.
4428	4431	So you've come back to re-plug our life-support systems in?
4431	4435	By the grace of your... By the stroke of your hand...
4436	4439	You're gonna bring us back to life? Is that why you've come?
4439	4442	- No, I've come... - I mean... The fuckin'...
4443	4446	nerve that you've displayed...
4446	4449	I'm just passing on the information, really.
4449	4454	Well, it's time to go in. We haven't got time to discuss this now. Come on.
4481	4484	David,
4484	4486	do a good show, all right?
4487	4489	Yeah, OK.
4515	4517	Little girl, it's a great big world
4518	4520	But there's only one of me
4521	4523	You can't touch cos I cost too much
4523	4526	- But tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
4526	4528	- Tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
4529	4530	Tonight!
4540	4541	You're sweet but you're just four feet
4542	4544	And you still got your baby teeth
4545	4547	You're too young and I'm too well hung
4547	4550	- But tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
4550	4553	- Tonight I'm gonna rock you - Tonight I'm gonna rock you
4553	4555	Tonight!
4556	4558	Oh, yeah
4579	4582	Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar!
4605	4607	You're hot, you take all we've got
4607	4611	JOE "MAMA" BESSER Drums
4611	4613	Next day, we'll be on our way
4613	4614	But tonight I'm gonna rock you
4614	4617	KOBE HALL Tokyo, Japan
4617	4618	Tonight I'm gonna rock you
4618	4620	Tonight!
4629	4632	Little girl, it's a great big world but there's only one of
4634	4637	Me!
4653	4657	Do you feel that playing rock'n'roll music
4657	4661	keeps you a child? Keeps you in a state of arrested development?
4662	4664	No, no. I feel it's like...
4664	4668	It's more like going to a national park or something,
4668	4670	and they've preserved the moose.
4670	4674	And that's... my childhood up there onstage is that moose.
4674	4678	So when you're playing, you feel like a preserved moose onstage?
4678	4683	I've been listening to the classics. I belong to a great series.
4683	4686	It's called The Namesake Series of cassettes.
4686	4691	They send you works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
4691	4694	So I've got Denholm Elliott reading TS Eliot on this one.
4694	4696	- Interesting. - Yes.
4696	4700	I've got Danny Thomas doing A Child's Christmas In Wales by Dylan Thomas.
4700	4705	Next month it's McLean Stevenson reads Robert Louis Stevenson.
4706	4709	- Treasure Island, I believe. - Interesting. Fascinating.
4709	4712	There's also the shorter works of Washington Irving
4712	4715	read by someone called Dr J.
4715	4721	- That's Julius Irving. - There you go, in keeping with the series.
4721	4723	- You like this? - Looks like Halloween.
4723	4728	This is my exact inner structure done in a T-shirt.
4728	4731	Exactly medically accurate, see?
4731	4734	So, if we were to take all your flesh and blood...
4734	4738	- This is what you'd see. - It wouldn't be green, though.
4739	4742	It is green. See how your blood looks blue?
4743	4747	That's just the vein, the colour of the vein. The blood is actually red.
4747	4751	Oh, maybe it's not green, then. Anyway, this is what I sleep in.
4751	4756	Denis Eton-Hogg, President of Polymer Records, was recently knighted.
4756	4760	What were the circumstances surrounding his knighthood?
4760	4764	The specific reason why he was knighted was for the founding of Hoggwood,
4764	4768	which is a summer camp for pale young boys.
4770	4774	David St Hubbins. I must admit I've never heard anybody with that name.
4774	4779	It's an unusual name. He was an unusual saint. He's not a very well-known saint.
4779	4782	- Oh, there was a St Hubbins? - Yes. That's right, yes.
4782	4786	- What was he the saint of? - The patron saint of quality footwear.
4786	4791	You play to predominantly... predominantly a white audience.
4791	4793	Do you feel your music is racist in any way?
4794	4796	- No, of course not. - No, not at all.
4796	4800	We say, "Love your brother." We don't say it really, but...
4800	4803	We don't literally say it. We don't literally mean it.
4803	4807	- We're not racists. - But... that message should be clear.
4807	4809	We're anything but racists.
4809	4813	We've grown musically. You listen to some of the rubbish we did early on.
4813	4815	It was stupid, and now we're...
4815	4820	I mean, a song like Sex Farm, we're taking a sophisticated view
4820	4825	- Of the idea of sex and music. - And putting it on a farm.
4825	4831	If I were to ask you your philosophy of life or your creed, what would that be?
4831	4834	Have a good time
4835	4838	all the time.
4838	4840	That's my philosophy, Marty.
4840	4843	I believe virtually everything I read, and I think that
4843	4849	is what makes me more selective than someone who doesn't believe anything.
4849	4852	Do you have a philosophy or a creed that you live by?
4853	4855	Well, personally,
4855	4859	I like to think about sex and drugs and rock'n'roll. That's my life.
4859	4862	If you were to have something written as your epitaph...
4864	4867	Here lies David St Hubbins,
4869	4871	and why not?
4872	4876	- You feel that sums up your life? - No. It's the first thing I could think of.
4877	4879	It doesn't sum up anything, really.
4879	4882	I'm a real fish nut. I really like fish.
4882	4886	- What kind of fish? - Well, in the United States, you have cod.
4887	4889	I like cod. And I love tuna.
4889	4893	Those little cans you've got here. Tuna fish... I love that.
4893	4896	- No bones. - Yeah.
4897	4900	If you could not play rock'n'roll, what would you do?
4900	4902	I'd be a full-time dreamer.
4902	4906	I'd probably get a bit stupid and start to make a fool of myself in public,
4906	4908	cos there wouldn't be a stage.
4908	4910	Probably work with children.
4911	4916	As long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, I can do without the rock'n'roll.
4918	4924	Well, I suppose I could work in a shop of some kind, or do freelance selling
4925	4927	of some sort of product.
4927	4931	- A salesman? - Like, maybe in a haberdasher,
4931	4936	or maybe like a... um... a chapeau shop or something.
4937	4941	You know, "What size do you wear, sir?" and then you answer me.
4942	4945	- Seven and a quarter. - "I think we have that."
4945	4947	Something like that I could do.
4948	4951	- You think you'd be happy... - "No, we're all out. Do you wear black?"
4951	4954	See, that sort of thing I think I could muster up.
4954	4957	Do you think you'd be happy doing that?
4958	4960	I don't know. What are the hours?
