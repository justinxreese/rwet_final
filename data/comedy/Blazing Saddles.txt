162	164	Come on, boys!
165	169	The way you're lollygagging around here with them picks and them shovels...
169	172	...you'd think it was 120°...
172	176	It can't be more than 114.
179	182	Dock that Chink a day's pay for napping on the job.
185	190	Now, come on, boys, where's your spirit? I don't hear no singing.
190	194	When you were slaves, you sang like birds.
194	197	Go on. How about a good old nigger work song?
206	210	"I get no kick from champagne.
213	218	"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
220	223	"So tell me why should it be true...
225	229	"...that I get a belt out of you?
233	237	"Some get a kick from cocaine."
240	243	What the hell is that shit?
244	248	I meant a song. A real song.
249	250	Something like...
250	255	"Swing low, sweet chariot..."
258	260	Swing low? Sweet chariot?
260	262	Don't know that one, huh?
264	266	How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?
267	270	"De Camp Town Ladies"?
273	274	Ah, you know.
275	280	"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.
281	285	"De Camp Town race track five miles long, all the doo-dah day!
285	289	"Gonna run all night, gonna run all day.
289	293	"Bet my money on the bobtailed nag, somebody bet on the bay!"
303	306	What in the wide, wide world of sports is going on here?
307	309	I hired you people to try to get a little track laid...
310	313	...not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots!
313	316	Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess we kind of got caught up.
316	320	Dummy, the surveyors say they may have run into some quicksand up ahead.
320	321	Better check it out.
321	324	Okay, I'll send down a team of horses to check out the ground.
325	329	Horses! We can't afford to lose any horses, you dummy!
330	331	Send over a couple of niggers.
335	337	You and you.
339	343	Sir, he specifically requested two niggers...
344	348	...but to tell a family secret, my grandmother was Dutch.
348	351	Get on that hand car and take it down to the end of that line!
352	353	Just trying to help you out.
356	358	I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!
362	366	"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.
367	372	"Camp Town race track five miles long, oh, doo-dah day.
372	376	"Going to run all night, going to run all day.
376	380	"I waged my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay!"
385	386	Am I wrong...
388	391	...or is the world rising?
391	395	I don't know, but whatever it is, I hate it.
398	399	Let me ask you something.
400	405	What is it that's not exactly water, and it's not exactly earth?
406	408	Quicksand!
413	416	Oh, shit, quicksand!
417	418	Goddang, now we are in trouble!
419	420	They're in trouble!
423	424	Get your rope there. Get over there quick.
439	440	Dang, that was lucky.
441	444	Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.
451	455	Yeah, we can take it right off to the, just a little bit to the left of that hill.
456	459	But we're going to die, Bart. They're going to leave us here to die!
460	463	Take it easy, Charlie. My foot is on the rail.
469	472	Then maybe down that canyon. I think it's pretty level off there.
473	476	We can't swing back to the right 'cause of that hill there.
476	479	That looks like the way we'll have to go from here.
480	483	Yes, we'll put her right down through there over that ridge.
488	490	Well, boys, the break is over.
490	492	Don't just lay there getting a suntan.
493	495	Won't do you any good, anyhow!
497	499	Take that shovel and put her to some good use!
508	509	What?
509	510	Don't do that now!
514	514	I have to.
515	519	Send a wire to the main office and tell them I said... OW!
520	525	Send wire, main office, tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.
532	535	And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is where we ran into quicksand.
536	538	Quicksand. Splendid.
539	542	And so the railroad has got to go through Rock Ridge.
542	544	Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.
545	546	Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
547	549	Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.
549	550	Be still, Taggart. Be still.
551	556	My mind is aglow with whirling, transient nodes of thought...
556	559	...careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.
560	560	Ditto!
563	567	Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!
568	569	I'm sorry, sir.
570	572	A plan. We need a plan.
573	575	What in the hell was that?
583	584	We can't hear ourselves think!
588	593	Sorry, your Worship, but I've got two men home sick with the flu...
593	595	...and it's utter chaos down here.
595	598	I'll try to keep it as quiet as possible.
598	600	But as you can see...
603	605	...this one is a doozey.
607	610	Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings. Well, do your best.
616	617	Now, let's see. Where were we?
617	618	Rock Ridge.
620	624	Yes, when that railroad goes through Rock Ridge...
624	627	...that land will be worth millions, and I want it!
628	632	I want that land so badly, I can taste it.
635	637	There must be a way.
639	640	Clumsy fool!
641	645	Wait a minute! There might be a legal precedent.
645	649	Of course! Land-snatching!
649	653	Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."
656	660	Haley vs. United States. Haley, seven. United States, nothing.
660	663	You see, it can be done. It can be done.
663	667	Unfortunately, there is one thing that stands between me and that property.
668	669	The rightful owners.
670	673	There must be some way of scaring them off, driving them out.
673	675	Getting rid of every human being alive in that...
677	678	It's down the hall and to the left.
680	681	I've got it!
681	682	What? What?
682	685	I know how we can run everybody out of Rock Ridge.
686	689	We'll kill the first-born male child in every household!
691	692	Too Jewish.
698	700	We'll work up a Number Six on them!
700	702	I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.
702	704	That's where we go riding into town...
704	706	...and a-whapping and a-whooping every living thing...
706	709	...that moves within an inch of its life!
710	711	Except the women folks, of course.
712	713	You spare the women?
713	717	No, we rape the shit out of them at the Number Six dance later on!
717	719	That's marvelous! That's so creative!
721	722	Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!
723	726	That uppity nigger hit me on the head with a shovel.
727	730	I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if you could find it in your heart...
731	734	...to hang him up by his neck until he was dead.
734	736	Got him locked up downstairs.
736	738	Consider it done, stout fellow.
747	749	I've got a special. When can you work him in?
749	753	I couldn't possibly fit him in until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.
754	755	Monday. Splendid.
761	764	Thank you, sir. And don't you worry.
764	768	We'll make Rock Ridge think it's a chicken...
768	771	...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!
776	779	It's all right, Taggart. Just a man and a horse being hung out there.
786	789	"There was a peaceful town called Rock Ridge,
791	794	"...where people lived in harmony.
796	799	"They never had no kind of trouble.
800	803	"There was no hint of misery.
810	812	"The town saloon was always lively...
813	816	"...but never nasty or obscene.
818	820	"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.
822	824	"He always kept things nice and clean!
827	829	"And all at once the trouble started.
830	832	"A pack of murderers and thieves...
833	835	"...like swarms of locusts they descended...
836	838	"...their aim to make the townsfolk flee."
867	869	Well, that's the end of this suit!
877	880	Have you ever seen such cruelty?
883	887	"Now is a time of great decision.
890	894	"Are we to stay or up and quit?
897	901	"There's no avoiding this conclusion.
904	908	"Our town is turning into shit!"
917	919	Well, I don't have to tell you good folks...
920	923	...what has been happening here in our beloved town.
924	928	Sheriff murdered, crops burned...
929	932	...stores looted, people stampeded...
932	934	...and cattle raped!
936	941	Now the time has come to act. And act fast!
944	946	I'm leaving.
946	951	You get back here, you old pious, candy-ass sidewinder!
952	955	There ain't no way that nobody is going to leave this town!
957	961	Hell, I was born here and I was raised here...
961	963	...and goddamn it, I'm going to die here!
964	967	And no sidewinder, bushwhacking, hornswoggling...
968	972	...cracker croaker, is going to ruin my biscuit-cutter!
979	981	Now who can argue with that?
984	986	I think we're all indebted to Gabby Johnson...
987	990	...for clearly stating what needed to be said.
991	993	I'm particularly glad that these lovely children...
993	995	...were here today to hear that speech.
995	998	Not only was it authentic frontier gibberish...
999	1002	...it expressed a courage little seen in this day and age!
1004	1006	What are we made of?
1007	1009	Our fathers came across the prairie...
1010	1013	...fought Indians, fought drought, fought locusts, fought Dix!
1014	1017	Remember when Richard Dix came in here and tried to take over this town?
1019	1020	Well, we didn't give up then...
1021	1025	...and by gum, we're not going to give up now!
1031	1032	Olson Johnson is right!
1033	1037	What kind of people are we, anyhow? I say we stay and fight it out!
1039	1043	Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about Olson Johnson's being right.
1043	1045	And I'm not giving up my ice cream parlor...
1045	1048	...that I built with these two hands for nothing or nobody!
1050	1051	Howard Johnson is right!
1055	1060	Well, if we're going to stay, and I think it's a big mistake...
1061	1065	...we're going to need a new sheriff. Now, who is it going to be?
1066	1069	Why don't we wire the governor to send us a sheriff?
1070	1072	Why should we get our own men killed?
1072	1076	Howard Johnson is right. We'll wire the governor.
1077	1082	Then let us pray for the deliverance of our new sheriff.
1082	1085	Will the congregation please rise?
1086	1091	I shall now read from the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke...
1094	1095	...and duck!
1105	1107	We've got to do something at once!
1110	1112	Governor, may I disturb you for a moment, sir?
1113	1116	If you will just sign this, governor. Right here.
1117	1118	Yes, what the hell is it?
1118	1120	Well, under the provisions of this bill...
1120	1123	...we would snatch 200,000 acres of Indian territory...
1124	1126	...which we have deemed unsafe for their use at this time.
1126	1128	They're such children.
1128	1130	200,000 acres! 200,000 acres!
1130	1133	What will it cost, man? What will it cost?
1135	1136	A box of these.
1137	1140	Are you crazy? They'll never go for it, and then again they might.
1140	1143	The little red devils, they love toys. May I try one?
1146	1147	These things are defective.
1151	1152	Right as usual, sir.
1153	1154	Show-off!
1154	1156	Just sign this, sir. Right here.
1157	1158	Okay, give us a hand here.
1159	1160	Work, work, work.
1162	1165	Hello, boys, have a good night's rest? I missed you.
1165	1168	Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.
1168	1169	What is this?
1169	1172	This is the bill that will convert the State Hospital for the Insane...
1172	1175	...into the William J. Le Petomane Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.
1176	1176	Gentlemen, this...
1177	1179	...this bill will be a giant step forward...
1179	1181	...in the treatment of the insane gambler.
1182	1183	Yes, bravo! Beautiful.
1187	1188	Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.
1188	1191	It's not Hedy. It's Hedley. Hedley Lamarr.
1192	1194	What the hell are you worried about?
1194	1196	This is 1874. You'll be able to sue her.
1208	1210	All right, help me in with this.
1211	1212	Just, ah, think of your secretary.
1213	1215	Ah, that was a very good suggestion.
1216	1218	Okay, is that it? Anything else?
1219	1221	Just this urgent telegram from Rock Ridge.
1221	1222	It arrived last Friday.
1224	1225	Read it, read it.
1226	1230	"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting bombed. Reign of terror must cease.
1231	1232	"Send new sheriff immediately."
1233	1234	Holy underwear!
1235	1238	Sheriff murdered. Innocent women and children blown to bits!
1239	1241	We've got to protect our phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.
1241	1245	We must do something about this immediately, immediately, immediately!
1248	1249	I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!
1249	1251	Give the governor a "hrumph."
1252	1253	You watch your ass.
1253	1255	Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.
1256	1257	Well put.
1258	1260	As Attorney General, I can assure you...
1260	1264	...that a suitable sheriff will be found to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.
1264	1265	Meeting is adjourned.
1266	1269	Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean to overstep my bounds. You say that.
1269	1270	What?
1270	1271	- Meeting is adjourned. - It is?
1272	1273	No. You say that, governor.
1274	1275	- What? - Meeting is adjourned.
1275	1276	It is?
1276	1279	Here, play around with this for a while. They are sweeping the country.
1280	1282	Why don't you give these out to some of the boys...
1282	1284	...in lieu of pay? Here you go.
1287	1289	And one for Miss Stein, my beloved secretary.
1289	1293	Play with these, boys, in lieu of the other things.
1294	1296	This friggin' thing is warped.
1298	1300	Why do I always get a warped one?
1303	1307	A sheriff! But law and order is the last thing I want.
1309	1314	Wait a minute. Maybe I could turn this thing to my advantage.
1315	1319	If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...
1320	1323	...that his very appearance would drive them out of town...
1325	1327	But where would I find such a man?
1329	1330	Why am I asking you?
1340	1343	Welcome to Hanging House. Not to worry...
1344	1346	...everyone is equal in my eye.
1364	1366	Oh, not my ear!
1370	1371	Governor!
1373	1374	Official business, sir.
1375	1376	Is it important?
1376	1378	It's very crucial.
1379	1380	Be with you in a minute.
1381	1383	Throw something on and stay in that position.
1386	1390	Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking the parapet, taking a look around.
1390	1391	What can I do for you?
1391	1393	Governor, as per your instructions...
1393	1395	...I'd like you to meet the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.
1396	1398	I'd be delighted... Wow!
1399	1401	I've got to talk to you. Come here. Have you gone berserk?
1401	1404	Can't you see that man is a nig...
1407	1410	Wrong person. Forgive me. No offense intended.
1412	1415	Have you gone berserk? Can't you see that man is a nig?
1416	1417	Don't worry, sir.
1418	1420	Now, Hedley, I've always trusted your judgment before...
1420	1422	...but haven't you taken a giant leap away from your good senses?
1422	1424	Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.
1425	1427	I'm about to make you an historic figure.
1428	1430	Maybe even get you a cabinet post.
1431	1432	A cabinet post!
1432	1433	Did you say that?
1434	1435	Wonderful!
1435	1439	Yes, the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff! Just think, sir...
1440	1441	...Washington, Jefferson...
1441	1442	...Lincoln.
1442	1444	Le Petomane!
1445	1447	Sir, you have the seeds of greatness in you.
1447	1450	Nurse them, caress them, pour water on them.
1451	1453	Don't short-change yourself, sir.
1454	1457	It will never work. They'll kill him dead in one day!
1457	1461	One day is all we'll need to secure your name in the annals of Western history.
1462	1464	And to get for you a nomination for, dare I say?
1465	1466	Dare, dare!
1466	1467	The Presidency!
1468	1470	Hail to the Chief! Hail to the Chief!
1479	1481	"Four score and seven years ago...
1482	1485	"...our forefathers brought forth on this..."
1485	1486	Are you coming back?
1487	1487	In a moment, dear.
1488	1493	Gentlemen, affairs of state must take precedent over the affairs of state.
1494	1495	Yes, of course, sir, we understand.
1496	1497	Will you make all the arrangements?
1497	1499	I will make all the arrangements.
1499	1500	Especially the funeral.
1502	1506	Good luck, good luck, boys. Wonderful working with you. Good luck!
1572	1575	Hurry up, get those flags up. He'll be here soon.
1576	1579	I just got a telegram from the governor's office.
1579	1580	The sheriff will be here at noon!
1581	1585	Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!
1587	1590	"As Honorary Chairman of the Welcoming Committee...
1591	1595	"...it is my privilege to extend to you a laurel and hearty handshake!"
1597	1598	Wonderful!
1598	1599	Excellent!
1600	1601	Can you see him yet?
1607	1608	The sheriff is coming!
1609	1611	Ring out the church bell!
1627	1630	Hey, the sheriff is a n...
1631	1632	What did he say?
1633	1634	The sheriff is near!
1635	1639	No, no, dag blame it, gol darn it, the sheriff is a n...
1661	1664	As Chairman of the Welcoming Committee...
1664	1669	...it is my privilege to extend a laurel and hearty handshake to our new...
1673	1674	...nigger.
1703	1705	Excuse me while I whip this out.
1711	1714	"By the power vested in me by...
1714	1717	"...the Honorable William J. Le Petomane...
1723	1725	"...I hereby assume the duties...
1725	1728	"...of the Office of Sheriff in and for the Township of Rock Ridge."
1729	1732	Gentlemen, let us not allow anger to rule the day.
1732	1735	As your spiritual leader, I implore you...
1735	1737	...to pay heed to this good book and what it has to say.
1741	1744	Son, you're on your own!
1749	1749	Hold it!
1750	1753	The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it!
1757	1760	Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.
1760	1763	Listen to him, men. He's just crazy enough to do it.
1764	1767	Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town!
1769	1773	Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate! Do what he say! Do what he say!
1791	1793	Isn't anybody going to help that poor man?
1794	1796	Hush, Harriet. That's a sure way to get him killed.
1798	1799	Help me, help me...
1800	1802	...somebody help me!
1804	1805	Shut up!
1809	1814	Oh, baby, you are so talented.
1814	1817	And they are so dumb!
1825	1826	Goddamn it!
1827	1828	I said, "Order"!
1829	1834	You know, Nietzsche says, "Out of chaos comes order."
1834	1836	Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!
1839	1841	Now everyone be quiet...
1842	1847	...whilst we listen to Harriet van Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...
1848	1853	...as she reads a telegram that she herself has composed to the governor...
1855	1859	...expressing our feelings about the new sheriff.
1867	1869	"To the Honorable William J. Le Petomane, Governor."
1870	1871	Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!
1873	1875	I'm not used to public speaking.
1877	1882	"We, the white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge...
1883	1887	"...wish to express our extreme displeasure...
1888	1890	"...with your choice of sheriff.
1890	1893	"Please remove him immediately.
1896	1899	"The fact that you have sent him here..."
1900	1904	"...just goes to prove that you are the leading asshole in the state."
1929	1931	The drunk in number two must be awake.
1937	1938	Are we awake?
1943	1944	We're not sure.
1946	1948	Are we black?
1948	1949	Yes, we are.
1951	1956	Then we're awake. But we're very puzzled.
1958	1960	I think I better straighten myself out.
1964	1965	Need any help?
1968	1970	All I can get.
1982	1984	That's okay. Sit down over here.
1995	1997	Hey, maybe you should eat something first.
1998	2001	No, thanks. Food makes me sick.
2010	2015	A man drinks like that and doesn't eat, he is going to die.
2017	2018	When?
2022	2022	What's your name?
2023	2027	Well, my name is Jim, but most people call me...
2030	2030	...Jim.
2033	2037	Okay, Jim, since you are my guest and I am your host...
2037	2040	...what is your pleasure? What do you like to do?
2041	2044	Oh, I don't know. Play chess...
2046	2047	...screw.
2048	2049	Well, let's play chess.
2053	2054	Checkmate.
2057	2058	Checkmate.
2059	2061	Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!
2062	2063	Happy days!
2073	2075	Man, why do you do that to yourself?
2076	2078	Oh, you don't really want to know that.
2079	2080	I do, I do!
2080	2082	Well, if you must pry.
2082	2083	I must, I must!
2085	2088	I don't know if you ever heard of me before, but...
2089	2093	...I used to be called the Waco Kid.
2094	2098	The Waco Kid. He had the fastest hands in the West!
2100	2101	In the world!
2102	2104	Well, if you're the Kid, then show me something.
2106	2111	Maybe a couple of years ago I could have shown you something, but today...
2113	2114	...look at that.
2115	2116	Steady as a rock.
2117	2119	Yes, but I shoot with this hand.
2120	2124	See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid. You were just pulling my lariat.
2140	2141	See that king?
2143	2145	Put your hands on both sides of it.
2149	2152	Now when I say, "go," you try to grab it first.
2153	2156	Man, that's no contest. You're a mile away.
2160	2165	Anyway, when you hear the word "go," you just try to grab it.
2166	2167	Ready?
2188	2189	You looking for this?
2194	2198	Well, raise my rent! You are the Kid!
2199	2202	Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.
2205	2206	What happened?
2207	2209	Well, it got so that every piss-ant prairie punk...
2209	2212	...who thought he could shoot a gun...
2212	2215	...would ride into town to try out the Waco Kid.
2218	2221	I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille.
2222	2224	It got pretty gritty.
2225	2227	I started to hear the word "draw" in my sleep.
2230	2231	Then one day...
2232	2237	...I was just walking down the street and I heard a voice behind me say...
2239	2243	..."Reach for it, mister!" I spun around.
2245	2247	And there I was face to face...
2250	2253	...with a 6-year-old kid!
2257	2260	Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away.
2264	2266	The little bastard shot me in the ass!
2269	2274	So I limped to the nearest saloon, crawled inside a whiskey bottle...
2277	2278	...and I've been there ever since.
2283	2284	Have a drink.
2291	2296	Anyway, that's all ancient history. Now you tell me your story.
2296	2300	What's a dazzling urbanite like you doing in a rustic setting like this?
2301	2303	If you really must pry.
2304	2305	I must, I must!
2310	2313	Well, back in '56...
2313	2317	...my folks and I were part of this long wagon train...
2318	2319	...moving West.
2332	2334	Well, not exactly part of it.
2335	2339	You might say we were bringing up the rear, when suddenly,
2340	2343	...from out of the West, came the entire Sioux Nation!
2344	2348	And let me tell you, baby, they were open for business!
2352	2356	Naturally, the white folks didn't let us travel in their circle...
2356	2357	...so we made our own.
2394	2395	Shvartzes?
2403	2406	Luzem gayen!
2411	2413	Cop a walk. It's all right.
2413	2414	Thank you.
2416	2418	Abi gezunt. Take off.
2427	2429	They're darker than us!
2433	2435	And the rest is history.
2437	2438	Impressed?
2443	2446	Always like to keep my audience riveted.
2500	2502	How about some more beans, Mr. Taggart?
2502	2504	I'd say you've had enough!
2508	2512	I understand there's a new sheriff in town. Who wants to kill him?
2519	2522	Why don't we give him to Mongo?
2526	2528	Holy shit, that's too cruel!
2529	2532	I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!
2540	2543	Down, boy, down, boy, down, Mongo!
2544	2545	Hey, it's me. Taggart.
2546	2547	Here, smell. Smell.
2551	2553	That's a good Mongo.
2554	2558	Hey, how about it? How would you like to mutilate that new sheriff?
2564	2565	Have a cigar.
2606	2608	Oh, by the way, I got a note this morning.
2608	2609	From who?
2609	2614	Well, I'm not sure. It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.
2618	2621	Well, once I establish myself in this town...
2621	2624	...Deputy Spade might turn out to be a groovy position.
2634	2638	Listen, Bart, I want you to do me a favor.
2639	2641	I don't want you going out there this morning.
2641	2643	You can't win these people over, no matter what you do.
2644	2645	They're just not going to accept you.
2656	2659	I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!
2663	2664	Just like old times.
2669	2673	Like I told you, once you establish yourself, they've got to accept you.
2675	2676	Catch you later.
2681	2681	Good luck.
2690	2691	Ah, good morning, ma'am.
2693	2695	And isn't it a lovely morning?
2696	2697	Up yours, nigger!
2702	2705	What did you expect? "Welcome, sonny."
2706	2708	"Make yourself at home."
2709	2714	"Marry my daughter." You've got to remember these are just simple farmers.
2715	2717	These are people of the land.
2718	2722	The common clay of the new West.
2723	2724	You know.
2727	2728	Morons!
2732	2733	What the hell is that?
2749	2752	Mongo! Santa María!
2754	2756	I believe in it. And if any one of you...
2756	2758	...friends and neighbors, kind of gather around and...
2759	2760	Holy shit!
2766	2770	And they say that now in Paris, France, even as we speak...
2771	2775	...Louis Pasteur has devised a new vaccine...
2775	2778	...that will obliterate anthrax once and for all.
2783	2786	Hey, you can't park that animal over there!
2786	2787	It's illegal.
2795	2800	Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and- mouth disease a thing of the past!
2800	2804	Never mind that shit, here comes Mongo!
2810	2811	I don't know what it is.
2819	2821	Sheriff, Mongo's back! He's breaking up the whole town!
2821	2823	You've got to help us, please!
2823	2825	Did you hear that? Now it's "please."
2825	2830	This morning I couldn't get the time of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?
2830	2833	Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who." He's more of a "what."
2834	2834	What he said.
2835	2836	Well, I don't know...
2836	2839	Oh, thank you very much!
2841	2842	The fool's going to...
2843	2845	I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.
2851	2855	No, no, don't do that! If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad.
2867	2868	Candygram for Mongo!
2881	2882	Me, Mongo.
2882	2884	Sign, please.
2895	2896	Mongo like candy.
2903	2905	A little further down, to the right.
2906	2909	I thought sure that Mongo would mash him up...
2909	2911	...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.
2912	2913	I just don't understand it.
2913	2914	Be still, Taggart.
2915	2918	My mind is a raging torrent...
2918	2920	...flooded with rivulets of thought...
2920	2924	...cascading into a waterfall of creative alternatives.
2925	2927	Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...
2928	2931	...you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.
2936	2939	Wait a minute, that's it!
2941	2942	And it will work!
2943	2945	You bet it will! What will work?
2946	2947	Elementary, cactus-head!
2947	2949	The beast has failed.
2949	2952	And when the beast fails, it's time to call in beauty.
2954	2955	Beauty?
2957	2960	She's never failed me before. She'll turn him into jelly!
2961	2963	She'll bring him to his knees!
2965	2968	Where's my froggie? Where's my froggie?
2969	2971	I don't know. I didn't see it when I came in.
2971	2973	Damn your eyes, look for it!
2981	2982	Oh, there it is.
2987	2992	That was a close one! Daddy loves Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?
3002	3004	I don't know how you did it.
3004	3006	He was nothing.
3006	3009	The bitch was inventing the candygram.
3009	3011	They probably won't give me credit for it.
3020	3022	Good evening, sheriff.
3022	3025	Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger."
3025	3029	I hope this apple pie will in some small way say thank you for your...
3029	3033	...ingenuity and courage in defeating that horrible Mongo.
3033	3036	Thank you. Much obliged. Good night.
3046	3050	Of course, you'll have the good taste not to mention that I spoke to you.
3055	3060	I'm rapidly becoming a big underground success in this town.
3060	3064	See, in another 25 years you'll be able to shake their hands in broad daylight.
3064	3067	Well, I'm not going to hold my breath for it.
3067	3072	Come on, I don't want to be late. Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.
3072	3074	Lili von who?
3089	3093	Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome. Come on in.
3098	3100	It's Hedley. For you, my dear.
3102	3105	Oh, how ordinary.
3108	3111	Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!
3113	3116	I can't find the words to truly express my joy...
3116	3118	...at the rekindling of our association.
3119	3122	Bullshit, what's the job?
3124	3126	I love it when you talk dirty.
3138	3141	Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to bwass tacks.
3141	3143	What do you want me to do?
3145	3149	I want you to seduce and abandon the sheriff of Rock Ridge.
3149	3151	You think you can do it?
3153	3155	Is Bismark a hewwing?
3155	3158	Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!
3171	3175	And now, folks, the gal you've all been waiting for...
3176	3180	...the Bavarian Bombshell herself! Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!
3193	3197	"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...
3197	3201	"...set men on fire. I have this power.
3203	3207	"Morning, noon and night, it's drink and dancing...
3207	3212	"...some quick romancing, and then a shower.
3213	3216	"Stage door Johnnies constantly surround me...
3217	3220	"...they always hound me with one request.
3222	3225	"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?
3226	3231	"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.
3239	3241	"I'm tired...
3242	3245	"...sick and tired of love...
3247	3249	"I've had my fill of love...
3251	3254	"...from below and above.
3258	3262	"Tired, tired of being admired...
3264	3267	"...tired of love uninspired.
3269	3272	"Let's face it, I'm tired.
3274	3279	"I've been with thousands of men again and again.
3280	3282	"They promise the moon.
3283	3288	"They're always coming and going and going and coming...
3290	3292	"...and always too soon."
3293	3294	Right, girls?
3294	3299	"I'm tired. Tired of playing the game.
3301	3305	"Ain't it a crying shame?
3306	3309	"I'm so tired."
3310	3312	Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!
3314	3316	Hello, cowboy, what's your name?
3318	3321	"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...
3321	3322	...are you in show business?
3323	3323	Nope.
3324	3327	Well, then, why don't you get your friggin' feet off the stage?
3340	3345	Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon hat, or are you just enjoying the show?
3354	3357	Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!
3369	3372	"Tired of playing the game.
3373	3377	"Ain't it a crying shame...
3378	3380	"...I'm so tired.
3388	3389	"She's tired.
3390	3392	"Sick and tired of love. Give her a break.
3393	3396	"She's had her fill of love. She's not a snake!
3396	3399	"From below and above. Can't you see she's sick?
3400	3401	"She's bushed.
3401	3404	"Tired of being admired. Let her alone.
3404	3406	"Tired of love uninspired.
3409	3410	"Don't you know she's pooped?
3411	3415	"I've been with thousands of men again and again.
3417	3419	"They sing the same tune!
3420	3423	"They start with Byron and Shelley...
3423	3427	"...then jump on your belly, and bust your balloon.
3434	3437	"Tired of playing the game.
3439	3441	"Ain't it a friggin' shame?
3443	3445	"I'm so..."
3445	3450	Let's face it. Everything below the waist is kaput!
3485	3486	What does it say?
3487	3492	"I must see you alone in my dwessing woom right after the show."
3507	3509	Wie gehts, meine schatzie?
3510	3511	Faw out!
3516	3520	A wed wose. How womantic!
3521	3523	Have a seat, shewiff.
3529	3530	Won't you excuse me for a moment...
3531	3534	...while I slip into something a little bit more comfortable?
3537	3538	Bitte, baby.
3546	3549	Why don't you loosen your bullets?
3555	3558	Ahh, I feel wefweshed!
3559	3561	Isn't it bwight in here?
3567	3570	There! Isn't that better?
3572	3575	Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.
3579	3579	How is it going?
3580	3584	He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands. By morning he will be my slave.
3585	3585	Splendid.
3586	3587	Oh, just let me have a little feel.
3589	3591	Where were we? Where are you?
3593	3595	Let me sit down next to you.
3598	3599	Tell me, schatzie...
3600	3604	...is it, ah, twu what they say about the way you people are gifted?
3607	3610	Oh, it's twu, it's twu!
3616	3618	Vill you care for another schnitzengruben?
3619	3623	No, thank you. Fifteen is my limit on schnitzengruben.
3624	3626	Well, then, how about a little?
3630	3633	Baby, please, I am not from Havana.
3634	3635	Excuse me, honey...
3636	3640	...besides, I'm late for work. I've got some heavy chores to do.
3640	3643	Vill I, vill I see you later?
3644	3648	That all depends on how much Vitamin E I can get my hands on.
3648	3650	Nein, nein, achtung!
3650	3653	No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!
3653	3656	I never met nobody like you! I can't live without you!
3659	3663	Please, you're making a German spectacle of yourself.
3666	3667	Auf wiedersehen, baby.
3675	3677	Oh, what a nice guy.
3685	3688	Oh, deary, dear. Look what the cat dragged in.
3702	3703	What's happening in the clean world?
3704	3705	Bad news.
3706	3710	I've got a writ here for Mongo's release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.
3715	3718	Why would a dude like Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?
3721	3722	It's legal.
3725	3729	Oh, those schnitzengrubens can wipe you out!
3736	3737	Wake up time!
3744	3746	Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.
3748	3749	Mongo no go.
3752	3756	Oh, come on, Mongo. You're a free man.
3757	3762	Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart. Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.
3764	3768	Mongo impressed, have deep feelings for Sheriff Bart.
3770	3772	Oh, you better watch out, big fella.
3773	3775	I think Mongo's taken a little fancy to you.
3780	3781	Mongo straight.
3786	3788	Maybe you know why a high-roller...
3788	3791	...like Hedley Lamarr is interested in Rock Ridge.
3791	3796	Don't know. Got to do with where choo-choo go.
3799	3803	Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care about where the choo-choo goes?
3804	3805	Don't know.
3807	3811	Mongo only pawn in game of life.
3815	3817	I think this might be a good time to mosey out...
3817	3819	...to where they're building the railroad...
3819	3821	...and maybe do a little snooping.
3861	3863	Damn, damn, damn!
3869	3873	Hey, how are you doing Bart? Get down off that horse!
3879	3882	Oh, you shifty nigger! They said you were hung!
3882	3883	And they were right!
3883	3886	Look at that star, hoo-ee! Civil service!
3890	3892	Wait. Back off, scamp.
3892	3895	You are addressing the duly appointed sheriff of Rock Ridge.
3896	3899	Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad is going through there!
3915	3918	Back up off your brother! Don't mess up your brother!
3936	3937	Holy mother of pearl!
3938	3941	It's that nigger that hit me on the head with the shovel!
3942	3946	Now what the hell do you think you're doing with that tin star, boy?
3946	3951	Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.
3953	3955	Well, now if that don't beat all!
3956	3958	Here we take the good time and trouble...
3958	3960	...to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what?
3962	3966	So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker than any Indian!
3967	3969	I am depressed.
3969	3973	Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I sure do hate to see you like this.
3973	3976	What if me and the boys were to shoot that nigger dead?
3976	3978	Would that pep you up some?
3978	3979	Well, it might help.
3979	3982	All right, boys. On the count of three.
3983	3985	I wouldn't do that if I were you.
3986	3988	Don't pay no attention to that alky.
3988	3990	He can't even hold a gun, much less shoot it.
3993	3995	Like I said. On the count of three.
3997	3998	One...
4000	4001	...two...
4002	4003	...three!
4014	4019	Well, just don't sit there looking stupid, grasping your hands in pain.
4020	4023	How about a little applause for the Waco Kid?
4035	4037	All right, I'm through being Mr. Goodbar!
4037	4040	The time has come to act and act quickly!
4040	4042	All my plans have backfired!
4042	4044	Instead of the people leaving, they're staying in droves!
4044	4048	Vhy don't you admit it? He's too much of man for you. I know.
4049	4051	You going to need an army to beat him!
4051	4053	You're finished.
4053	4058	Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!
4064	4067	Shut up! You Teutonic twat!
4068	4070	I must think.
4079	4083	Wait a minute. She said army. Of course!
4083	4088	An army of the worst dregs ever to soil the face of the West!
4092	4096	I've decided to launch an attack that will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!
4097	4098	What do you want me to do, sir?
4099	4102	I want you to round up every vicious criminal and gunslinger in the West.
4102	4103	Take this down.
4104	4109	I want rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters...
4109	4113	...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...
4114	4118	...vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits...
4118	4122	...muggers, buggerers, bushwackers, hornswagglers...
4122	4126	...horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...
4126	4128	...shit kickers and Methodists!
4131	4133	Could you repeat that, sir?
4143	4144	Where's everybody going?
4146	4147	Read this.
4157	4161	Well, can't you see that's the last act of a desperate man?
4162	4166	We don't care if it's the First Act of Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!
4167	4171	Now, wait a minute! Wait just one doggoned minute!
4172	4177	Just give me 24 hours to come up with a brilliant idea to save our town.
4178	4180	Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.
4181	4182	No!
4183	4185	You'd do it for Randolph Scott.
4191	4194	All right, sheriff. 24 hours.
4254	4255	Next!
4256	4257	Qualifications?
4258	4260	Rape, murder, arson and rape.
4261	4262	You said rape twice.
4263	4264	I like rape.
4267	4269	Charming. Sign right here.
4271	4272	Take that badge.
4276	4277	Qualifications?
4278	4281	Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.
4281	4285	Wait a moment. What have you got in your mouth?
4288	4290	Nothing, eh? Lyle.
4293	4294	Gum!
4295	4297	Chewing gum on line, eh?
4298	4301	I hope you brought enough for everybody.
4303	4304	I didn't know there was going to be so many.
4310	4312	Boy, is he strict!
4312	4315	We've got to get in there close and find out what's happening.
4317	4318	There's our ticket!
4326	4327	Hey, boys!
4328	4330	Look what I've got there!
4332	4334	Hey, where are the white women at?
4348	4350	Man, that was pretty! I liked that.
4351	4355	Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.
4359	4362	We don't need no stinkin' badges!
4364	4364	Next!
4365	4366	Qualifications?
4367	4368	Stampeding cattle.
4369	4370	That's not much of a crime.
4370	4372	Through the Vatican!
4372	4373	Kinky!
4377	4379	Why, Rhett, how many times have I told you...
4379	4381	...to wash up after weekly cross-burning?
4382	4383	See, it's coming off.
4386	4389	And now, for my next impression, Jesse Owens!
4391	4392	Catch them!
4393	4398	Hold up, men, we'll head them off at the pass!
4399	4403	Head them off at the pass? I hate that cliché!
4422	4423	Say, "hello."
4423	4424	Hello.
4425	4427	Listen to me, and listen to me good.
4427	4429	I want you to get all the brothers together...
4430	4434	...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint and nails you can lay your hands on...
4434	4439	...and meet me tonight 3 miles due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.
4440	4440	You understand?
4441	4442	Say, "goodbye."
4444	4445	Thanks a lot, brother.
4474	4477	All right, folks, I know you're a bit confused wondering what you're doing...
4477	4479	...out in the middle of the prairie in the middle of the night.
4479	4481	You bet your ass!
4482	4483	I'm hip.
4483	4485	Now, before the sun comes up...
4485	4491	...we're going to build on this sight an exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.
4494	4498	Every building, every storefront, every rock and every tree...
4498	4501	...right down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse.
4503	4504	I get it!
4504	4507	And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr and his men come riding in...
4507	4508	...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...
4509	4511	...they'll actually be destroying the fake Rock Ridge!
4511	4513	But they'll think it's the real Rock Ridge!
4513	4515	But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!
4515	4519	How're we going to do it? We don't have the time nor the people.
4519	4521	Wrong! There's why.
4524	4526	Who the hell are they?
4530	4535	Railroad workers. They've agreed to help us make our dream come true.
4535	4538	And all they ask in return is a little plot of land...
4538	4540	...they can call their own to homestead.
4540	4541	What do you say?
4549	4552	We'll give some land to the niggers and the chinks...
4553	4555	...but we don't want the Irish!
4560	4562	No deal.
4563	4566	Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!
4571	4572	Oh, Lord...
4573	4578	...do we have the strength to carry on this mighty task in one night?
4581	4583	Or are we just jerking off?
4594	4598	Okay, okay, we have done it. Now, let's see what we have done.
4639	4643	Men, you are about to embark on a great crusade...
4644	4647	...to stamp out runaway decency in the West.
4647	4650	Now you will only be risking your lives...
4650	4655	...whilst I will be risking an almost certain Academy Award nomination...
4656	4657	...for Best Supporting Actor.
4658	4660	Now raise your right hand for the pledge.
4663	4664	Right!
4665	4668	And repeat after me. I...
4670	4671	...your name...
4671	4672	...your name...
4673	4676	Schmucks! ...pledge allegiance...
4676	4677	...pledge allegiance...
4678	4679	...to Hedley Lamarr...
4680	4681	...to Hedy Lamarr...
4682	4683	That's Hedley!
4683	4684	...that's Hedley...
4685	4686	...and to the evil...
4687	4688	...and to the evil...
4688	4690	...for which he stands!
4690	4692	...for which he stands!
4692	4697	Now go do that voodoo that you do so well!
4710	4713	Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.
4714	4717	Yep! We forgot one little detail.
4717	4721	Nothing is missing. Everything is here, down to the last hitching post.
4721	4723	People. There are no people.
4724	4726	Now don't panic. Don't panic.
4727	4730	We just made a perfect copy of Rock Ridge.
4730	4733	Now all we've got to do is make perfect copies of ourselves.
4735	4737	But they'll be here in half an hour.
4737	4739	Right, so we've got to start working fast.
4740	4744	You men start working on the dummies. Jim and Mongo, come with me.
4744	4748	I've got an idea that will slow them down to a crawl.
4748	4749	All right, let's go!
4757	4759	Yeah, that's nice.
4781	4786	Le Petomane Thruway! Now what will that asshole think of next?
4789	4791	Has anybody got a dime?
4792	4796	Somebody's got to go back and get a shit-load of dimes.
4805	4809	Hurry up. Speed it up or we're never going to get to Rock Ridge!
4809	4812	Come on, move them through!
4818	4820	Well, they're through the tollbooth.
4823	4825	Look at this, they're buying it!
4836	4839	All right, here we go. Hold your ears, folks!
4839	4841	It's show time!
4846	4847	Nothing!
4847	4848	What are we going to do?
4849	4852	Any minute now they're going to discover the town is fake and pull out!
4854	4857	You think you could squeeze off a little shot from here...
4857	4859	...and set off the dynamite down there?
4860	4862	I'll give it a try.
4872	4876	Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...
4876	4878	...and may God grant...
4890	4891	It's a fake!
4892	4893	We've been suckered in!
4910	4914	Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!
4938	4940	Forgive me, Lord!
5003	5005	"Throw out your hands, stick out your tush.
5005	5007	"Hands on your hips, give them a push.
5007	5011	"You'll be surprised, you're doing the French Mistake. Voilà!"
5013	5015	All right, cut!
5020	5021	Wrong!
5024	5027	Just watch me. It's so simple!
5028	5029	You sissy Marys!
5030	5034	Give me the playback. And watch me, faggots!
5048	5048	Have you got it?
5049	5050	Yessssssss.
5051	5053	Sounds like steam escaping!
5053	5056	Action! Okay, wait until I get out.
5087	5091	Cut! What in the hell do you think you're doing here?
5091	5093	This is a closed set!
5094	5097	Piss on you! I'm working for Mel Brooks.
5097	5099	Not in the face!
5101	5102	Thank you.
5103	5106	They've hit Buddy! Come on, girls!
5115	5117	You vulgar shit!
5118	5120	Why, you miserable pansy!
5125	5127	I'm parked over by the commissary.
5131	5135	You brute, you brute, you vicious brute!
5137	5139	All right, all right...
5154	5155	How many days do you have left, Joey?
5156	5158	They lose me right after the bunker scene.
5161	5162	What the hell is that?
5168	5170	Get your pies for the great pie fight!
5175	5178	This is our Studio commissary where some Hollywood stars...
5178	5179	...come to eat. Keep in line.
5187	5189	And now we'll go to the Special Effects Department.
5194	5198	Yankee bean soup, cole slaw and tuna surprise.
5238	5239	Taxi!
5244	5246	Drive me off this picture!
5275	5277	You dropped your beads.
5277	5278	One, please.
5280	5281	Uh, student.
5282	5283	Are you kidding?
5285	5286	Pain in the ass.
5287	5289	Look, Herman, I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!
5290	5290	Hedley!
5319	5320	Freeze it!
5321	5324	Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.
5324	5327	Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.
5328	5330	All right, we'll settle it like men.
5332	5333	With our fists.
5334	5338	Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.
5346	5350	How did he do such fantastic stunts with such little feet?
5356	5358	You shot the bad guy!
5361	5362	Well, what do you want to do now?
5363	5365	Come on, let's check out the end of the flick.
5366	5369	I sure hope there's a happy ending. I love a happy ending.
5374	5377	Sheriff, you can't go now. We need you.
5378	5382	My work here is done. I'm needed elsewhere now.
5382	5385	I'm needed wherever outlaws rule the West.
5386	5390	Wherever innocent women and children are afraid to walk the streets.
5390	5393	Wherever a man cannot live in simple dignity.
5394	5397	Wherever people cry out for justice.
5398	5399	Bullshit!
5402	5404	All right, you caught me.
5404	5407	To speak the plain truth, it's getting pretty damn dull around here.
5408	5411	Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.
5416	5417	'Bye, baby brother.
5420	5421	Keep the faith, brothers!
5438	5439	Where are you headed, cowboy?
5441	5442	Nowhere special.
5445	5450	Nowhere special. I always wanted to go there.
5452	5452	Come on!
5484	5487	"He conquered fear and he conquered hate."
5488	5491	"He turned our night into day."
