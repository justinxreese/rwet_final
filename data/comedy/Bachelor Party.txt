24	27	Step away from the curb, children.
43	46	Hi, Sister! You look terrific today!
47	50	- What have you done with your hair? - You're late again, Rick.
50	54	- I know. But I have a very good excuse. - There can be no excuse for tardiness.
55	57	You're right. You're absolutely right.
57	61	I should never have stopped and saved that drowning infant.
61	63	I'm weak, Sister! I'm just so weak!
63	65	All right, now. Stop that.
66	68	Children, on the bus.
68	73	Sister, if you ever get lonely after vespers, I'm the man to call.
73	75	My number's in the book.
75	78	Get going, Rick. You're late enough as it is.
79	80	Think about it, OK?
80	83	OK, come along, children!
90	91	Attention, passengers.
91	96	We are now leaving Nun Central on ourjourney to hell and beyond.
97	99	The captain has turned off the No Smoking sign.
99	102	You may now move about the cabin freely.
106	111	Thank you for being Catholic, and for choosing the St Gabriel school bus.
134	138	Now don't forget, Garcia. Ten percent of that goes to the house.
139	140	Ahh, youth!
145	151	You'll love these shots. Thank you very much, Mrs Reeves. Have a nice day.
151	152	Next!
161	164	Ho-ho-ho! Look at those babies!
164	168	Adorable. Come on, let's get started. Are we married?
168	170	- I'm separated. - Then there is a God.
171	174	Let's try something a little special. Try these on, Timmy.
175	177	Ooh, yeah. Chic in the sun, yeah.
178	180	Take that drink right there.
181	183	Yeah, that looks like fun, hm?
183	186	To me, this is an incredible shot.
186	189	OK, I can see you're not impressed. And you're right. I hate it too.
189	191	Your kid is more hip, more now, more '80s.
193	195	Let's try this right here. Now get ready.
195	198	Hold on. I'm crazy about this one. Your own baby Jedi.
198	202	This is terrific. You're gonna like this. Huh? Huh? Huh?
203	207	All right, you're not into science fiction. OK.
207	210	Oh! Mrs Klupner, why didn't I see this before?
211	214	Why don't you lean into the picture with your child?
214	216	Oh, yes, yes.
217	219	Yes, yes, yes.
219	221	Lean in a little more.
221	225	If I was that kid, I would breast-feed until I was 17 or 18.
225	228	OK. Now hold that pose, Mrs Klupner.
235	239	Timmy, why don't you go to sleep? There we go. Good boy. There we go.
275	276	Raul!
278	281	Who the hell put this shit in my beer cooler?!
282	284	Jesus Christ!
284	286	Stupid people!
286	288	I gotta change the oil.
291	291	Hey!
292	295	Rudy! Here, boy! Hey, Rudy!
295	298	Oh, shit! I don't believe this!
299	302	Guys, this is the problem with American cars!
303	307	Help me put this crap together and we'll get outta here.
310	315	The Police concert's sold out? My customers are gonna kill me!
315	317	Screw that!
317	319	Screw Sting!
319	322	- Hi, guys. How's it goin'? - How are you, you animal?
322	324	Great. I'm a dead man.
325	327	Hello. Concert Tickets.
328	329	What?
330	333	You're kiddin'! Boy George has a yeast infection?!
333	336	He's canceling?! You know what this is gonna cost me?!
336	339	Hey, do me a favor. Don't call me again, OK?
340	342	Let's get outta here.
342	346	I told you not to call me again! You're full of shit! Eat my...
346	349	Oh, hi, Mom. No, no, no. I didn't know it was you.
350	351	Right. Eggs and milk.
352	354	Ma... Ma, I'll talk to you later.
355	359	- This better be important. - This guy gets along with everybody.
359	360	Oh, yeah. A real diplomat.
362	364	Eat me.
364	366	I love it when he talks like that!
367	371	- We'd like to order now. - Hey, no sweat. No sweat, guys.
371	373	You wanna order?
373	375	Here's today's deals. OK?
376	379	OK, we got veal.
379	381	We got veal... Par...
383	385	Veal... Par...
385	387	What's this word?
388	389	Parmesan.
389	392	That's that meat with that cheese on it. See, I don't eat cheese.
392	395	Gives me mucus. Clogs me up with phlegm.
395	399	And butter, that's another thing. Clogs you up with snot.
399	401	Please, we're in a hurry.
401	403	Ryko, come on, take a break!
405	407	Hey, be right there, guys.
407	411	Hey, keep your slimy paws out of my food, man. Order your own food.
411	413	I hope you choke, you animal.
413	415	Hey!
417	419	Get outta here.
419	424	All right, OK, now we're all here. So what's the big announcement?
425	429	Gentlemen, I'm not gonna beat around the bush on this thing.
429	432	We've known each other since grade school,
432	435	so I'm gonna give this to ya right from the hip.
435	438	I mean, it's gonna come straight from the old shoulder.
438	441	I mean, no fancy stuff or anything...
441	442	Come on, Rick!
442	446	All right. OK. All right, all right, all right. This is it.
451	453	- I'm gettin' married. - Yeah, right, yeah.
459	462	That was not ajoke, guys!
463	470	A week from this Saturday, I turn in my amateur standing and I... I go pro.
470	472	- I don't believe it. - Come on!
473	474	Fuck me!
475	477	Well, thanks for tellin' us, man.
484	486	Guys!
486	487	Guys!
490	492	Guys!
494	496	Our buddy is gettin' married.
496	501	This is the happiest moment of his life and you guys are giving him a hard time.
501	505	You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Congratulations, buddy.
508	510	Come on, guys!
510	515	Look, Rick, I'd rather be dead. But if this is what you want, good luck, man.
516	519	All the best. It should happen to me, man.
521	523	Since you're gonna do this...
523	525	- You really are gonna do this? - Yeah.
526	528	At least we can make sure you go out in style.
528	532	Let's have a bachelor party, with chicks and guns and fire trucks
532	534	and hookers and drugs and booze...
534	539	Yeah, yeah, yeah! All the things that make life worth living for!
539	541	Speech! Speech!
542	544	All right, all right.
545	548	I want you to know that this marriage
548	553	is not in any way gonnajeopardize my relationship with my pals, damn it.
553	556	We're still gonna go bowling every Tuesday night.
556	559	Still gonna play cards every Friday night.
559	562	And wear each other's underwear every Sunday. Nothing is gonna change!
563	565	I love you guys and I always will.
566	569	- Hey, a toast! - To Rick and Debbie.
570	572	To us.
574	576	To girls with big tits.
576	579	Good point! Good point! Good point.
606	608	- Excuse me... - What?
608	611	- I'd like to pay for this. - Could you wait till the song is over?
611	613	Oh, sure. No problem.
618	620	Excuse me.
621	625	- Where can I try on these pants? - Right over there. Can I take these for you?
625	630	You'll really like these. I have a couple of pairs myself. They fit very nice.
643	645	Phoebe?
647	651	I don't think your brother did such a good job of fixing the dressing-room doors.
651	654	Whaddaya mean? They look great!
655	658	- You don't see a problem here? - Not really.
658	660	No? Maybe it's just me.
665	667	Debbie, I don't believe you!
667	670	I am your friend and you don't even tell me!
670	672	Bobbi, what is going on?
673	676	I just heard from O'Neill. Oh, God, I'm so excited!
676	679	- What's happening? - Debbie's marrying Rick!
679	680	- Really? - Really.
680	682	Oh, my gosh!
683	686	Oh, my gosh! You're actually marrying Rick!
687	691	- Wait a minute. Does Cole know about this? - You went with him for two years!
692	694	No. And he won't leave me alone.
694	697	And your parents can't be too thrilled about this.
697	702	No, as far as they're concerned, the only good Rick is a dead Rick.
702	705	But I've made my decision, and we're gonna do it.
705	709	I don't believe it! Mrs Rick Gassko!
709	711	You're getting married...
711	715	Seems like only yesterday I showed ya how to give a blow job.
718	723	I'll give you a different kind of high
724	728	No, I'm not like the rest of the boys
729	732	I'm from Decatur, Illinois
733	738	And I am suave, debonair
738	742	I got this boss, curly dark black hair
743	747	And I like how you run... baby!
748	752	Because you never say maybe
752	754	I like you...
755	756	Oh, shit!
761	767	Well, hey, the meal is just about ready, so it's time for spice...
767	771	Yes, it's spice time, and the lucky spice is...
771	772	Paprika!
773	778	Thank you, thank you, thank you! You've made me the happiest spice in the world!
778	782	It's a veritable UN for dinner here, so Swedish meatballs!
786	788	Ah! Vino!
788	791	A little vino... would be keeno!
791	793	I want some wine!
794	795	Now...
795	800	What meal would be complete without a little dead meat?
800	804	Yes, America's favorite food: Dead animal flesh.
804	810	All the burners are occupied at this time, so I'm just gonna have to improvise here.
812	814	- Hi, babe! - Hi!
820	825	- What are you doing? - Just welding up a little dinner, that's all.
828	830	It's you!
835	837	- It's good to see you. - You too.
840	843	- God, you're a slob! - Yeah, but I'm a fabulous cook.
844	846	Yeah? And what are we having?
846	851	Well, it's either Swiss steak, meat loaf... I dunno. Charred flesh of some sort.
851	854	- Why don't we name it after we eat? - Good idea.
856	859	Mr Chef? Your vegetables are on fire.
859	865	Oh! Hey! It's OK. It's all right. It's broccoli flambé. It's supposed to do that.
865	871	Just a little tricky, that's all. Guess I put in a little too much nuclear waste, huh?
872	874	- Wanna hear something great? - You betcha.
874	878	Bobbi and Phoebe are gonna throw me a shower. It's gonna be so much fun!
878	883	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are gonna throw for me.
883	887	I hope you like potato salad. It's chunky style, my favorite.
887	890	- You're gonna have a bachelor party? - Sure! You bet!
890	894	Hey, it's a traditional event, and I am a traditional kinda guy.
896	900	How about this? Does this look great or what?
900	904	- It looks awful. - Well, looks can be deceiving.
908	910	Not in this case, however.
910	914	Nope, this is definitely the food that prison riots are made of.
915	918	Are we gonna have girls at our party?
919	921	Well...
923	928	No, it's a stag party, and that means that does stay home.
929	933	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
933	936	Ohhh! Those!
937	939	What do you mean?
939	944	I mean, like, from what I hear, it's a tradition. And you're a traditional guy.
945	950	Come here, you little vixen. I'm gonna set you straight about something.
950	953	Women mean nothing to me, and that is why I am so in love with you.
956	958	Do you understand what I'm saying?
960	962	I need you to promise me.
964	967	OK. OK. I promise. You got it.
973	977	You know, I... I know a way that we can seal this bargain.
978	979	- Yeah? - Mm-hm.
984	985	Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait!
986	990	I got a surprise for ya! And I think you're really gonna like it!
991	994	Aw, come on, honey! We'll take turns!
1000	1003	OK, Ricky. Wanna hold out your arm?
1003	1006	You wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you?
1006	1011	Hey! I've changed my mind! I don't need a blood test. I'm not even gonna get married.
1011	1015	- The wedding is off, chief. - Bear. Chicken, chicken, chicken!
1019	1024	You were always sneaky, Stan. You were always very, very sneaky.
1025	1027	Hey, you ready for this big party?
1027	1032	I understand that the guys have some fascinating women lined up for you.
1032	1033	A bevy of...
1037	1040	Keep your voice down. I've got the wife in the other room.
1040	1042	Uh, Stan...
1044	1047	Stan, is this supposed to be like this?
1049	1051	No, that's incorrect.
1051	1053	Oh.
1054	1057	I can't understand you getting married.
1057	1060	Do you have any idea what you're giving up? Any idea? An inkling?
1061	1064	Everything! Wild parties. Running around like a maniac.
1064	1067	Women every night. Nakedness. Gone!
1067	1069	I miss that so much, Ricky.
1069	1071	Stan, you're beginning to depress me.
1072	1076	Oh, well, maybe you'll feel just a little better after this.
1076	1079	Easy. Easy. And hold.
1079	1082	Oh, that's a fair trade. A cotton ball for all my blood.
1083	1085	OK, Ricky, all finished.
1087	1090	Hey, I'm really looking forward to this bachelor party.
1091	1096	Whatever you do, you don't say nothin' to Tina, OK? She'll kill me.
1096	1098	- Who don't you say nothin' to? - Tina?
1098	1100	Tina. OK.
1100	1104	Don't screw me up. I told her I'm going to a plasma convention.
1104	1106	Oh, well, that's brilliant.
1106	1108	Hi, Tina!
1109	1113	Rick! Mr Goldsmith, this is my brother-in-law. He's getting married.
1114	1116	Congratulations.
1117	1118	Nurse, take over.
1118	1121	I am so happy for you!
1121	1123	That's great. I'm glad. Thanks.
1123	1128	Listen, I gotta run. I gotta make sure the guys have got the hookers!
1129	1131	- Hookers? - He didn't say hookers.
1132	1135	- Did I say hookers? I didn't mean... - You said hookers.
1135	1137	He didn't say hookers. I'm walking Ricky out.
1138	1142	You had to open your mouth. You had to say something. You had to say hookers!
1142	1146	- Doc, I'll pay my bill! Don't hurt me, please! - I'll kill you!
1149	1152	I'll pull out your lights! I'll rip out your guts!
1152	1156	I'll break you in half! Now shut up and get outta here!
1156	1158	OK. All right.
1158	1161	Oh, listen. I'll see ya Saturday for the...?
1161	1163	Out!
1168	1171	Mrs Phillips. You're next.
1184	1187	- OK, who serves? - Your turn, Dad.
1204	1207	It's long, it's to the fence, it's to the wall! It's gone!
1208	1209	- Rick! - Yep.
1209	1212	Hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
1212	1215	Uh... maybe we should go in now.
1215	1218	No. We will at least finish this set.
1224	1226	- Ready? - Yo!
1234	1236	Yes! Cleveland wins the pennant!
1240	1246	One of these days, I'm gonna burn the Thompson court right to the ground.
1249	1254	I gotta admit my tennis is a little rusty, but polo... There's a game, eh?
1255	1258	Unrelenting, constant challenge to the senses.
1258	1260	A beautiful, manly experience.
1260	1264	Rick, I want to cut through the BS.
1266	1268	- I'd like that. - Good.
1269	1271	I think you're an asshole.
1271	1275	No, let me correct that. An immature asshole.
1275	1279	Which is fine, except that you're marrying my daughter
1279	1283	and I'm afraid that my grandchildren are gonna be little assholes.
1283	1285	- Mr Thompson, I... - No, let me finish.
1286	1289	Debbie is an adult. She can do what she wants.
1289	1294	But if you want your marriage to last, you have to change some things about yourself.
1294	1298	- Now, if I may make some suggestions? - Oh, feel free.
1298	1301	Good. First, you're a slob.
1301	1303	You dress like a bum.
1303	1306	Second, you're unmotivated.
1306	1310	You have no self-esteem, no thought about the future.
1310	1314	You're inconsiderate. You're insensitive. You're insincere.
1315	1320	I'm having the same caterer for your shower that we had at our Christmas party last year.
1320	1322	That'd be great! They're wonderful!
1322	1327	If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
1327	1331	Why...? Why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
1331	1335	Oh, of course you do. And I trusted my ex, Kevin, too.
1336	1339	Cousin, I can only speak to you from experience.
1339	1341	But what do you think happens at bachelor parties?
1342	1345	Think they drink tea and play Scrabble?
1345	1347	Llene, I trust Rick. He promised...
1347	1350	Debbie, please! Don't be naive. Men are pigs.
1352	1355	Girls, why don't we go inside and have some lunch?
1356	1359	Boys! Come on inside and have lunch!
1360	1362	In a second.
1363	1367	And you're irresponsible. A show-off.
1367	1369	You're vulgar. You're inappropriate.
1370	1373	You're unrefined. You're obnoxious.
1374	1379	Well, Mr Thompson, that's really quite a list. And you're right. You're absolutely right.
1379	1382	And I think, if I really apply myself,
1382	1387	I could be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch.
1399	1401	Rick, we don't have a dog.
1402	1406	Oh, too bad. That's a waste of some good fat. Are you going to eat your potato, darling?
1406	1409	- You want this? - You betcha.
1409	1412	Yeah, me and Debbie are gonna have kids right away.
1412	1415	I'd like to adopt this 17-year-old Korean girl I've had my eye on.
1416	1419	I figure why beat around the bush, but, I mean, this pup is fertile,
1420	1423	and I know I'm perfectly capable, so you don't have to worry.
1423	1426	You'll have some American grandkids in no time at all.
1427	1430	I tell ya, Mrs T, this is really some spread. This is pretty good chow.
1431	1433	Usually I just have ajam sandwich for lunch.
1434	1438	Do you know what ajam sandwich is? You take two pieces of bread, jam 'em together...
1444	1448	- Hello, everybody! Am I late? - Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
1448	1450	- How are you, Cole? - Fine, just fine.
1450	1453	Ilene! You're looking very well.
1455	1457	- Mrs Thompson... - Cole...
1457	1459	Always a pleasure.
1464	1466	Debbie...
1466	1467	And, uh...
1468	1470	Bond. James Bond.
1472	1475	So, Cole, how's your game coming along?
1475	1478	- Better and better, sir. - Good.
1478	1480	I'll take you on.
1480	1483	We tried some doubles this morning but it didn't work out.
1485	1487	Mother, what is Cole doing here?
1488	1491	Well, you know your father enjoys his company.
1491	1495	Oh, he must, if he took time off from his Hitler Youth rally.
1499	1501	- Good shot! - Thank you, sir.
1503	1509	Cole, I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
1509	1511	Yes, I am, sir.
1513	1517	- Son, I don't want you to give up on her. - I have tried to change her mind.
1518	1522	It's not her mind you have to change. It's Mr Shit For Brains in there.
1523	1528	- Yeah, but how can I do that? - If it were up to me, I'd reason with him first.
1528	1532	And if that failed, I'd try more persuasive action.
1535	1538	More... persuasive action?
1541	1545	Good... Keep me informed.
1548	1550	Goodbye, darling.
1550	1553	Goodbye, Mom. Thanks for everything. It was great.
1554	1558	- Nice seeing you again, Rick. - You too, Mrs T. Let's do this every day.
1558	1562	- How about tomorrow? I'll bring weenies. - Well, I have, uh... club.
1562	1565	- What time's it over? - Uh, Rick. Let's talk.
1567	1569	Honey, the boys have something to discuss.
1570	1572	Let's leave 'em alone for a minute, huh?
1574	1577	If this is about the facts of life, I got it covered.
1577	1579	- Rick, I want Debbie. - You do, huh?
1580	1582	Yes, I do. You dump her and I'll give you cash.
1582	1586	Well, what's Debbie's Blue Book value right now?
1586	1588	- $5,000. - No.
1588	1590	- 7500? - Not interested.
1590	1592	All right, all right, all right.
1593	1597	10,000 plus a GE toaster oven,
1597	1599	a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
1599	1602	Cole, read my lips now.
1602	1604	I am marrying Debbie.
1605	1606	Michelin tyres, brand-new.
1607	1609	A set of Sears' best metric tools.
1612	1613	What's going on?
1613	1617	This big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances laying around.
1618	1623	Debbie, Cole is just trying to save you from making a mistake. A big mistake.
1623	1625	Oh, Daddy...
1625	1628	Hey, thanks, Dad. Listen, we gotta go.
1630	1632	Debbie! He's gonna hurt you.
1633	1636	He'll never be true to you the way I would.
1638	1641	We'll keep that in mind. Cole Whittier, ladies and gentlemen!
1642	1646	A funny, funny guy as well as being a wonderfully talented human being.
1646	1649	Take care, babe. We love ya.
1649	1652	Hey, Rick! You and I, we're not through yet.
1672	1673	Hey...
1674	1675	Hey...
1676	1677	What?
1677	1679	I can't sleep.
1680	1683	I got something for that.
1690	1693	Will you stop fooling around? I need to talk.
1693	1695	What's the matter?
1695	1698	I don't know. I just feel scared.
1699	1702	Oh, baby... What about?
1703	1705	Hmm?
1708	1710	The wedding. My parents.
1711	1713	Your parents. Our friends.
1713	1714	My job.
1715	1716	The future.
1716	1718	Our relationship.
1718	1720	The caterers. My gown.
1721	1723	Your tuxedo.
1724	1726	The honeymoon. Our apartment.
1727	1728	My shower.
1728	1730	Your bachelor party.
1732	1736	Well, how about the Middle East? You all right with that?
1736	1739	Honey, everything is gonna be all right.
1739	1743	Before or after I have my nervous breakdown?
1750	1752	You are so tense.
1753	1755	Come on.
1757	1759	That feels so good.
1760	1762	That's a coincidence. It's supposed to.
1762	1766	Close your eyes. Drift off to sleep again, OK?
1766	1770	Ltjust so happens... I'm a great guy
1771	1776	and, very soon, you're gonna be Mrs Great Guy, all right?
1820	1824	Well, there you go, ma'am. End of the line. Last stop.
1824	1828	I have a great idea. Why don't I just pal around with you guys for a while?
1828	1834	No, no, no. We have some manly things we have to do, and this is no place for a woman.
1834	1838	- Are you sure you don't want me to go? - How about "no"?
1838	1840	I don't wanna go!
1843	1846	Remember, you promised me no screwing around.
1846	1849	- I won't! I swear on my mother's grave. - Your mother's not dead.
1849	1852	Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
1853	1855	Have a good time.
1857	1860	Don't have a great time. You catch my drift, Mr Traditional Guy?
1860	1862	Hmm, yeah, I understand.
1862	1866	And you have a fun shower. Use soap.
1870	1872	I love you.
1872	1874	And I love you.
1877	1880	Come on, Rick! Party!
1889	1894	Presidents have stayed in this suite. It's gorgeous!
1895	1898	What presidents?
1899	1903	- What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing. Let's get crazy.
1903	1905	Yeah!
1907	1912	- When do the girls show up? - Gary is taking care of that right now.
1917	1921	All right. I think I've got just what you're looking for.
1921	1922	Great.
1922	1924	Margot! Darleen!
1925	1927	These are twins of pleasure.
1929	1931	Wow! Twins!
1931	1932	Great!
1932	1935	They're gonna be just fine. Just fine.
1937	1938	Hi, ladies.
1938	1943	Maybe after the orgy tonight we can get together, have a cup of coffee or somethin'?
1944	1947	Thanks, man. We'll see you girls later. Ciao!
1968	1970	Hi!
1972	1973	Hi.
1973	1975	Say, I must have just missed my friend.
1976	1978	He hired some of your girls for a bachelor party?
1979	1983	Yeah, Parkview Hotel, room 1002. What about it?
1983	1987	Yeah, right, well, um... here's the new address.
1987	1992	There's been a change of plan. We're sending the girls to his house instead.
1992	1995	- Oh, really? - Yeah, and, uh... here's a fifty.
1996	2001	Now I want this to be a surprise for the groom, so you never saw me, OK?
2002	2004	No problem.
2025	2027	Move it out, move it out, move it out!
2031	2034	You be careful with that bus. It's a rental.
2037	2038	Was I kidding? Was I kidding?
2039	2041	We who are about to go apeshit salute you!
2041	2043	We want women!
2046	2048	Hold it! Hold it!
2049	2052	Before we move on, I have a little surprise.
2054	2057	I have flown in someone dear to all of us.
2057	2060	A man who has traveled over 3,000 miles.
2060	2062	Come on, Rick, let's go.
2062	2066	A man whom none of us have seen since he left town.
2068	2070	Come on, come on!
2070	2073	A man whom we affectionately call Peckerhead!
2073	2075	Oh, my God, our dad is here.
2075	2078	It's your childhood chum and mine, Brad Mollen!
2078	2079	Brad!
2079	2082	That Peckerhead! Where is he?
2087	2088	Guys!
2089	2090	Guys!
2090	2092	Guys! Guys!
2093	2096	For the last time, I'm telling you to get off of there!
2097	2099	Off! Off!
2099	2100	OK!
2104	2105	Guys!
2106	2108	Holy shit!
2109	2110	Dr Stan!

2116	2118	Jay!
2119	2120	Rudy!
2121	2123	Diagnosis?
2123	2125	- Medically speaking? - Yeah.

2138	2142	I'm having the best time. I love you guys! I love everybody!
2142	2146	- How's your wife? - I hate her. I hate her guts.
2147	2149	The bitch!
2151	2154	I've got this. You wanna share this?
2154	2157	Oh, gee, two on a Quaalude. That's bad luck.
2158	2160	OK, let's go, guys. Come on, Brad.
2160	2163	Listen, you and your wife got problems, Brad?
2163	2168	No. No. Cos I love you guys. I love my friends. I love everybody!
2168	2170	I just wanna party!
2170	2171	Party!
2188	2191	- Just where do you guys think you are? - The Library of Congress?
2192	2194	- Detroit? - Beyond the sun?
2194	2196	Any of those right?
2196	2199	This is the Parkview Hotel. I am the hotel manager.
2202	2206	This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here.
2207	2210	So I see. Well, thank you. It's been very nice talking to you.
2210	2213	You're a hell of a guy, and you're doing a hell of ajob.
2224	2229	Pamela, you're here! How nice! Come say hello to our guest of honor.
2230	2234	Pamela! Hi, how are you! Good to see you!
2234	2237	- You look great. - Oh, thanks, honey.
2237	2240	Debbie, it's Pamela.
2240	2242	Pamela, how are you?
2243	2246	Come sit down and I'll get you some punch.
2247	2252	Mrs Thompson, do you have any more of this dip? It's, like, really excellent.
2252	2254	You just ate Purina Cat Chow.
2254	2257	Oh, it's, like, so good!
2262	2265	And what are you girls giggling about?
2265	2267	- Shall we tell her? - Yeah.
2268	2272	Yesterday we found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
2272	2277	And we made a few changes. I think the boys will really be interested.
2281	2285	Oh, well, good. I hope you ruin their stag party, the swine!
2285	2287	1003... Aha!
2289	2290	1002.
2291	2296	And now, to our honored guest Rick and his lifelong friends, I say, gentlemen:
2298	2300	Start your boners.
2305	2307	Women!
2310	2313	Yeah! This is a bitchin' place!
2315	2318	Oh... I am stunned.
2318	2320	I did the balloons myself.
2321	2326	Oh, what a clever use of prophylactics. This is beyond my wildest dreams, guys!
2326	2330	- Where's the women? There's no women. - Rudy, one thing at a time.
2331	2333	Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
2333	2335	OK. What's first?
2335	2339	A bit of a warm-up. We spend an hour with Nymphos Without Pants.
2342	2344	Olivier is in that, right?
2344	2347	Then... it's on to the real thing!
2347	2349	OK, Rudy. Screen.
2352	2354	It's good to see you, Brad.
2354	2359	My marriage sucks. It's all crap. It's just a big pile of shit!
2360	2365	Well, maybe your marriage oughta lay off the grains for a while.
2366	2370	Don't you understand? She hates me. She hates my guts. It's over!
2370	2374	You'll see. As soon as you get married, everything changes.
2375	2377	Why are you going through with this?
2377	2379	Wait, wait. What do you mean? What changes?
2379	2381	OK, Ryko, lights!
2383	2384	Lights!
2403	2407	I viewed it yesterday. Great director, good lighting...
2410	2414	Take that off! Take it off and drive it home!
2416	2419	God, this doesn't waste any time, does it?
2425	2428	Go, baby! Do it, brother! Lay that pipe! Drive it home, brother!
2434	2436	Hey! What gives?
2437	2440	- Did you check this out? - Kick it! Kick it!
2442	2444	Forget that. This part's so much better.
2444	2448	You guys can't believe... This is a human being doing this. Watch this.
2448	2451	Kiss him all the way down! All the way down!
2451	2455	Go! Go! Go, go, go, go!
2459	2462	What is this?! What is going on?!
2464	2468	I am not complaining, but I usually don't like my filth this clean.
2468	2471	What a waste of two women!
2472	2475	I don't get it. The dirty parts were there yesterday.
2475	2478	At least Gary's coming up with the real thing.
2478	2479	Oh, yeah.
2479	2481	Women!
2502	2503	Yes?
2503	2508	Yeah, hi. Is this 1381 Franek Street?
2509	2510	Yes.
2511	2513	We're here.
2513	2515	How nice.
2515	2518	Um... I'm Dr Tina Gassko.
2519	2521	Oh, Tina! Stan's wife!
2522	2524	Come in!
2527	2532	God, now she's really gonna see what kind of ajerk-off she's marryin'.
2541	2543	Rick is just gonna love all of these.
2545	2547	Debbie, look, it's Tina.
2547	2550	I think everyone's here now.
2551	2553	Look who's here. It's Tina.
2569	2571	Another one of these, huh?
2571	2573	Looks that way.
2573	2574	A buck's a buck.
2574	2576	Yep.
2600	2601	Ohh!
2610	2613	Is there an empty outlet around here?
2618	2619	Thanks.
2661	2663	God, this is beautiful.
2663	2666	She reminds me of my wife. She was so young when we met.
2667	2669	Bitch!
2672	2674	Hi, guys, how's it goin'?
2675	2677	Get him! Get him, get him, get him!
2681	2684	Everybody back! To a neutral corner, please.
2684	2687	- What's goin' on? - Nothing's goin' on!
2688	2691	Would you get that animal off of me?
2691	2694	This place should be wall-to-wall tits by now.
2694	2697	Guy paints a beautiful picture.
2697	2701	All right! All right! I'll find out what's goin' on.
2702	2705	Looks like the only guy who got screwed was you.
2705	2706	Hey, screw you.
2706	2708	Should! Should!
2708	2709	Should!
2709	2711	I can't believe my money's been wasted.
2711	2714	So, what do you guys think of the party so far?
2715	2717	All right. OK.
2719	2722	I think the man has done a very good job with the party so far.
2722	2724	All right, maybe not.
2729	2731	Rick, I wanna talk to you.
2731	2733	Hey, it's Cole!
2735	2738	Did anyone order an asshole from room service?
2738	2742	- Look, I don't want any trouble. - Oh, come on, just a little.
2743	2747	- Rick, I want to make you another deal. - Oh, be still, my heart!
2747	2749	Out the window is something I wanna show you.
2750	2754	Out the window? Oh, this is gonna be a surprise. I'm a nut for surprises.
2756	2758	You see that out there?
2758	2761	That, Rick, is my most prized possession.
2761	2763	That's my new Porsche.
2763	2765	Wow!
2765	2766	Guys, can you see that car?
2767	2770	Oh, that's beautiful! What a car!
2771	2774	Rudy, isn't that a beautiful car?
2774	2776	Yeah.
2776	2779	Oh, yeah! That's a beautiful car, Rick.
2780	2783	Hey, guys, excuse me. I gotta go shake the weasel.
2784	2786	- It's a great car. - Oh, the best!
2786	2791	- God, I love that car. - I am very, very happy... for the two of you.
2792	2793	Chips?
2793	2798	Listen, Rick, I'm willing to trade you my new Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
2798	2802	Oh, Cole! A car for Debbie?
2802	2805	I mean it, Rick. All you have to do is dump Debbie.
2806	2810	Oh! Oh, Cole! This is perplexing. What an intriguing offer you've made.
2810	2814	Guys, what should I do? Should I take the car, or should I take Debbie?
2814	2817	- Debbie. - The car.
2817	2818	Depends on mileage.
2818	2822	- The Porsche! The car! - Take Debbie... The car!
2836	2839	- Debbie! Debbie! - The car!
2839	2842	What a decision I have to make here.
2842	2844	I would hate to be in your shoes, pal.
2845	2848	- Low mileage. It handles like a dream. - Well, so does Debbie.
2848	2852	I just got that car two months ago. It's got everything, it's got...
2852	2854	Shit.
2854	2856	Shit! Shit! Shit!
2857	2860	- Something amiss? - My car is gone!
2860	2862	Maybe it had something to do.
2862	2863	You know...
2863	2866	If I don't get my car back, you're dead, mister!
2872	2874	Gone just a few seconds and I miss him already.
2877	2880	Isn't it childish getting revenge on the guys like this?
2881	2885	You heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
2885	2888	That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
2888	2890	Good evening, ladies. Follow me.
2891	2893	Go on. Just don't touch anything.
2895	2897	God, look at those guys! What a hunk!
2898	2900	Look at that guy's buns!
2904	2905	Come on, Mom.
2905	2907	Debbie, I don't know about this.
2907	2911	Mom, come on, we'll have a great time. You might even get lucky.
2911	2913	Debbie!
2929	2931	Is there a Rick Gassko registered there?
2938	2940	Hold it! It's not Gary. It's Michael.
2941	2942	I don't believe it!
2942	2944	I may as well have left my genitals at home!
2945	2947	Michael, when are you comin' over?
2947	2949	Right after work.
2949	2953	Guess what, buddy? Debbie and her friends just walked in here.
2954	2957	No kidding! Well, that's interesting.
2958	2963	Michael, hang around down there for a while. We're gonna come down.
2963	2964	Yeah. Bye.
2964	2967	Guys, we are going out for some air.
2969	2970	Some air?
2971	2973	- Where are we going? - Out.
2973	2975	I love going out.
2975	2978	Rick, I don't think I wanna go.
2978	2980	Come on, Brad, it'll be good for ya.
2980	2983	No... I just wanna be alone.
2986	2990	Well... all right, but do your homework, and you can watch TV for a half-hour,
2990	2992	but then straight to bed, young man.
2993	2994	OK.
2998	3003	Come on, just stay with me, guys. When a night gets dull, call in a pro.
3010	3011	Al, how are you?
3011	3014	Ed, we're so glad you could come at the last minute
3014	3017	and fill in as our keynote speaker.
3017	3019	It's a pleasure, Al. I'm always glad to help out.
3020	3023	I should call my service. Is there a phone I can use?
3023	3025	- Yeah, right there. - Thank you.
3025	3029	Ed, this is the biggest turnout we've ever had. Hey, this is our mascot.
3029	3031	Hiya, fellas!
3031	3036	We've had some big speakers, but no one with your marketing experience.
3036	3040	I just wanna let 'em know where I am. I'm expecting an important phone call.
3040	3045	I had to get out of the house anyway. My daughter's having a bridal shower.
3084	3087	I'm a doctor! I can't do this!
3096	3099	- Will your friend do this? - He'll do anything for money.
3099	3101	I love that attitude!
3101	3104	- Are they still out there? - I'll check. Wait.
3115	3116	I don't believe this!
3124	3126	What does she think she's doing?
3127	3129	Maybe checking him for a hernia.
3131	3133	Oh, it's amusing?
3134	3135	- It's amusing. - What now?
3136	3139	It's action they want? Well, we're the guys to give it to 'em.
3139	3141	Eh, me hearties?
3143	3147	Guys, this is Chippendales' star attraction.
3147	3152	Mr Nicholas, better known as Nick the Dick.
3152	3154	Nick the what?
3154	3156	The Dick.
3162	3165	Oh-ho! Wow!
3167	3170	I was impressed when they opened the World Trade Center,
3170	3173	but this is a piece of work!
3173	3177	Well, let's get this thing going. Tray, please, Michael.
3180	3181	Bun.
3182	3184	Oh, well now, this is good.
3184	3187	OK, Nick, or is it Mr Dick?
3188	3190	Nick.
3190	3192	You wanna do the honors?
3199	3201	- It's up to you. - Gentlemen.
3203	3205	This is gonna be great!
3215	3218	Here's your orders, ladies. You can help yourselves.
3234	3235	Is that the foot-long?
3235	3237	And then some.
3264	3266	Excuse us. Mom, let go.
3292	3294	Hey, lady, how much?
3294	3296	Talk to the pimp.
3298	3299	Hi.
3299	3300	Hi.
3300	3302	Hey, nice seeing you.
3302	3303	Hello.
3305	3307	Hey, let's talk.
3308	3310	Hey, bro! What it be?
3311	3315	- You're a pimp? You look like Gandhi. - I'm telling you I am, Joe.
3315	3317	- I want women. - I got women.
3317	3319	They sit on your face, anything you want.
3320	3322	Great. I want some. How much?
3322	3326	Big hassle now, bro. Soon they go to customers.
3326	3329	I got a bachelor party at the Parkview Hotel.
3329	3332	That would be out of sight, dude.
3332	3334	Customers in same hotel.
3334	3339	Let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
3339	3342	- $200. - Great.
3342	3344	Sold. 45 minutes, no problem.
3344	3346	Room 1002.
3346	3349	Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
3349	3351	Milt?
3351	3353	This being Milt.
3355	3357	Pretty heavy, hey, dude?
3362	3365	Girls back in 45 minutes
3365	3368	or Milt cuts your balls off.
3368	3370	Fair enough?
3370	3371	Shake.
3378	3381	I just bet my balls, and shook on it.
3385	3387	Did you happen to see Tina's face?
3387	3392	Bobbi was less shocked, of course. She's used to seeing something that size.
3393	3395	Hey, yo! Brad!
3396	3398	Hey! Big Brad!
3401	3402	Where's the young man?
3411	3413	What are you doing?
3413	3415	I'm killing myself.
3415	3417	Oh.
3425	3428	You know, Brad, marriage is a dicey thing at best.
3429	3431	And sometimes people say things they don't mean.
3431	3435	But you and Sue, you're mature people. You'll work this stuff out.
3435	3439	- You gotta lighten up, man. - No, Rick, I don't care any more!
3440	3445	She hates me! I'm no good for her. I'm just gonna end it all right here!
3447	3450	Oh! Oh! God!
3452	3454	Are you all right?
3454	3456	Yeah.
3457	3460	Pain is such a rush.
3462	3464	Oh, this is good.
3464	3467	- Is there anything I can do for ya? - Oh, no...
3468	3470	This is pain.
3471	3473	Fabulous.
3473	3476	There could be some major damage here.
3481	3483	Mmm! Mmmm!
3499	3502	Hey, man! Go check out your car. It's beautiful.
3503	3505	- My car? Where is it? - It's outside.
3518	3520	Shit!
3522	3524	Shit!
3525	3527	Oh, shit!
3529	3530	Shit!
3530	3531	Shit!
3532	3534	Shit! Shit!
3534	3537	Rick, goddamnit!
3537	3540	You've had it! I'm gonna get you!
3551	3553	Shit!
3553	3554	Shit! Shit!
3557	3560	This is your bachelor party, and you're not havin' a good time.
3561	3562	I'm having a great time!
3562	3565	You're making a big deal out of nothing.
3565	3568	- Where the hell is everybody? - I don't know.
3568	3570	Surprise!
3570	3573	The team bus just pulled in!
3579	3581	Hookers!
3581	3584	It's a party! Party, Ricky!
3594	3597	I had a wiener right in my hand.
3597	3602	I told you, men are pigs. I saw those swine just standing there.
3602	3604	God! What a gross thing to do.
3604	3608	I have to admit, even for Rick, that was beyond the Valley of Good Taste.
3608	3613	Yeah, well, Rick and his pals are probably knee-deep in whores by now.
3613	3616	- I can't wait to see what those guys are up to. - Me either.
3616	3619	If I find out Stanley's been screwing around, I'll kill him.
3620	3624	Kill? I won't do anything that drastic. I just won't get married.
3624	3627	Good. You're finally talking some sense.
3627	3630	Well... let's get ready, you guys. Let's get going.
3630	3635	- You with us, Mom? - A strange wang right in my palm.
3639	3640	- Can I help you? - We're the band.
3641	3642	- Band? - O'Neill sent us.
3642	3644	Oh, O'Neill! Great!
3644	3648	Everybody's busy in the bedrooms right now, but come on in.
3648	3652	Oh, that's nice hair. I'll try to make sure no one smokes around you.
3652	3656	Are you together? If not, maybe introductions are in order.
3660	3662	Why do good girls like bad boys?
3664	3666	Why do good girls like bad boys?
3668	3671	It must be the thrill she gets When he lights her cigarette
3672	3675	Or the way his nostrils flare Every time he combs his hair
3676	3678	Why do good girls like bad boys?
3684	3686	Why do good girls like bad boys?
3687	3689	Alligator!
3704	3707	Hey, that was incredible. And also wonderful.
3709	3712	It was a moving experience. I thank you. From the bottom of my heart.
3712	3714	Next!
3715	3718	Ricky! Go, babe. Get in there, my brother.
3719	3722	My dearest family member, get in there. She's incredible.
3722	3726	No, no, no. I will, but the party's young and it's just starting up.
3726	3731	I want to ask you a question first. You're my older brother. Let me ask you some advice.
3731	3734	You are a married man, right? I am about to be a married man.
3734	3737	What can I expect from this marriage thing? What is the honest scoop?
3738	3743	The honest scoop? The first month, from the beginning, is terrific. It's great.
3743	3746	The second month, things calm down a little bit.
3748	3752	Third month, you're looking through old phone numbers, old girlfriends...
3753	3758	But, by the fourth month... by the fourth month you're just... you're numb.
3759	3761	You know? Just... It's incredible.
3761	3765	So by the fifth month, hopefully, football season starts.
3765	3768	- Football. - You got ball games. You got Monday Night.
3768	3775	Stan, I am so glad we had this chat. You've really answered my questions.
3776	3781	Hi. We were just walking by and we heard the music. Can we come in?
3781	3785	Sure! Come on in! Join the party, babe.
3794	3796	What can I get for 25 bucks?
3796	3800	An elevator ride around the block, a pogo pump, or a pogo swirl,
3800	3802	or a pump with an underground hammer.
3802	3805	Wait a minute. Whatever happened to hand jobs?
3823	3825	Hi.
3825	3826	Hello.
3843	3845	I was dreaming
3845	3847	Woke up screaming
3847	3849	I was drowning in a pool of sweat
3850	3852	My hands were shaking
3852	3853	My head was aching
3853	3856	My stomach was so upset
3857	3863	That's when I saw two eyes glowing in the dark
3864	3867	I fell in love with a little demon
3867	3870	Little demon, little demon
3871	3874	Angels above can't take my little demon
3875	3877	Little demon, little demon
3877	3880	Little demon!
3885	3887	She crawled up beside me
3887	3889	Her smile terrified me
3889	3892	And I was suffering in ecstasy
3906	3910	- What the hell are you doing? - I'm slashing my wrists.
3910	3914	- With an electric razor? - I couldn't find any razor blades.
3915	3917	At least your wrists will be smooth and kissable.
3918	3920	Give me this thing! What is the matter with you?
3920	3925	Will you go out there and have some fun and have a few laughs, please?
3927	3930	No, no, no. Have fun first, and then have a few laughs.
3931	3933	Just forget about the marriage for a couple of hours.
3934	3937	This is a party, remember? Go out there and party.
3940	3942	That's good. That's good.
3956	3958	Gary, how's the big stallion?
3959	3961	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
3962	3967	We're talking marriage, kids, the whole thing.
3968	3972	I'm very happy for you. Name your first six kids after me, OK?
4021	4024	My name is Tim. I'm always available.
4025	4027	By the way, I also do engine work on BMWs.
4028	4029	Bye.
4072	4075	That's another example of better living through chemistry.
4075	4077	I said that's another example...
4077	4079	Are these on or am I wasting my time?
4092	4093	All right!
4095	4097	This is gonna be great.
4097	4099	Sex with a donkey. Incredible.
4129	4132	Hi! Come on in!
4132	4134	Drugs to the right, hookers to the left.
4138	4140	Good to see ya again.
4166	4168	Hey! I oughta smack you.
4169	4173	Rick, buddy... pal of mine...
4174	4176	- I'm concerned. - Hey! What about?
4176	4181	This is your party! Your bachelor party! You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
4181	4183	Not true. I had a bunch of sex tonight.
4183	4187	I'm just very fast. You haven't been able to see me. There - I had it twice!
4187	4190	Come on. I got something you can't resist.
4190	4191	You do?
4191	4193	You remember Tracey?
4194	4198	Tracey? I am a mortal man, O'Neill. Of course I remember Tracey.
4198	4200	You remember how crazy she was about you?
4200	4206	- Tracey was crazy about me? - "Oh, Rick, you're so funny!"
4206	4211	I called her and told her that you were about to be put on the unavailable list.
4211	4214	She decided to come over and give you a little something.
4214	4216	She did?
4216	4219	- Right in there. - The bedroom? Tracey's in the bedroom?
4219	4220	You got it.
4221	4224	- Tracey is in the bedroom? - Heaven awaits.
4227	4229	O'Neill...
4230	4235	Oh... well, now, O'Neill, this is a gift I...
4235	4237	You bet.
4237	4240	How can I... how can I turn this down?
4240	4242	You can't.
4242	4244	I guess I can't.
4244	4247	- Oh, Tracey...? - Yeah.
4249	4252	Oh, hell, all right. All right, I will. All right, OK. I will. All right.
4252	4255	If I'm not back in half an hour, call the paramedics.
4256	4257	All right.
4257	4258	That's the old Rick!
4267	4269	Hello?
4277	4279	Oh, eat my chair!
4294	4297	Rick, take me, please.
4299	4302	Rick, you promised me.
4302	4305	You promised me you wouldn't make love to anybody else.
4306	4308	Go for it! Go for it!
4314	4319	Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be true. Be strong.
4319	4321	Go for it!
4322	4326	What, are you nuts? Look at my tits! They're perfect!
4327	4329	Rick, take me, please.
4335	4336	How'd it go?
4337	4341	Well, hey... Hey, if she can walk, I don't know my business, you know?
4342	4347	Oh, hey, O'Neill, I just lied. Nothing happened in there, all right?
4347	4350	I know how much this meant to ya, but I couldn't do it, OK?
4350	4353	I love Debbie. I made a promise and I'm crazy about her.
4353	4355	Hey, I understand.
4356	4357	Don't worry about it.
4358	4363	To tell you the truth, I'm envious. I wish I had someone who was in my every thought.
4363	4366	Somebody I could spend all my time with.
4366	4369	Somebody I could really respect.
4369	4371	Hey, look at the cans on that bimbo.
4445	4448	I am looking for this dung head who took my women.
4448	4450	He's being liar to me.
4450	4452	I want my bitches back.
4468	4472	Holy shit! I'm going to get Milt right now.
4472	4474	I'm going to get the fuck out of here.
4481	4483	- Who was that? - I don't know.
4484	4486	- Well, what is this? - Got me.
4487	4490	- Well, how about this? - Still drawing a blank.
4493	4495	- Hey, he look familiar? - Very.
4496	4500	Get the hookers in a circle. We're gonna put Cochise out of business.
4513	4515	I can't believe we're doing this.
4515	4518	We are supposed to be hookers. Act sexy.
4524	4526	If Stanley's there I'll rip his butt.
4526	4530	Stop with this! We're supposed to be hookers! Act sexy!
4532	4535	- I just wanna find him up there... - Shut up with that.
4535	4540	Don't tell me to shut up. We don't need sex, we just have to find the room.
4545	4547	You girls is the hookers, right?
4547	4549	Yes, of course we're hookers.
4559	4564	- The boss said deliver hookers. - We are not hookers, you big dumb ape!
4572	4574	How dare you!
4580	4582	Girls, let's get outta here...
4582	4585	Wonderful!
4593	4596	Any of you guys from out of town?
4597	4599	Come on, fellas... Fellas!
4608	4610	Where the hell is he?
4610	4614	- It's gotta be on this side. - No, it's this side.
4620	4621	Shit! Shit! Shit!
4622	4624	All right, this is it.
4624	4626	Let me fix you up here. Let's show the gold.
4626	4628	Beautiful. Gorgeous.
4630	4632	OK. Go get him.
4649	4651	Make love to me... please?
4675	4680	T minus 3, 2, 1. We have ignition!
4680	4682	Kill!
4691	4694	We got him now!
4696	4698	No! No!
4701	4702	You can't do this!
4703	4706	We're just gonna put you in a safe place until after the party.
4707	4711	No, no! Please! Please stop! Don't! No!
4711	4714	Hey! Hey, you guys can't do this!
4714	4717	Hey! Hey, come on!
4722	4725	Now you stay out of trouble, young man.
4725	4726	Take care!
4726	4728	I hope you die, you bastard!
4728	4730	Bye!
4732	4735	Hey, you bastards! I'm gonna live!
4737	4738	Aaghhh!
4739	4741	Well, here we are.
4742	4747	This is gonna be some night, huh? Are you ready for this? Are you ready?
4749	4751	Come here.
4753	4758	Look, uh... why don't you make yourself comfortable, all right?
4761	4763	There's a terrific moon out tonight.
4795	4798	OK, we're here. How do we get this donkey inside?
4798	4800	I don't know.
4801	4804	You don't know? You had it all figured out. You had a plan.
4804	4807	Well, maybe I did. I don't know. I forgot.
4809	4813	I'd like to get you on an operating table, just once.
4815	4818	Ha-ha-ha!
4818	4819	Ha-ha-ha what?
4820	4822	- I got it. - You got what?
4824	4828	You're gonna be OK. Everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it.
4829	4834	How about some air? You can take in some air. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
4834	4835	Take in some air, huh?
4839	4840	Oh, no! Shit!
4843	4845	- Are you sure you're OK? - Yes.
4855	4857	Ohh, God...!
4859	4860	They seemed like nice guys.
4861	4865	- Thanks for your help, Ed. We appreciate it. - Any time, Al. Good night.
4867	4870	Cole?! My God, son, what are you doing here? What happened?
4870	4874	The party's upstairs, sir. They made me get naked and...
4874	4875	What?
4875	4879	They made me get naked and hung me out from the window. It was so scary and I fell.
4880	4882	Get a hold of yourself. What room are they in?
4882	4886	- They're on the tenth floor, sir. - I'm going up there. I'll take care of this.
4886	4890	Now you go and get yourself some clothes. You look awful.
4890	4891	Yes, sir.
4896	4900	OK, this side 27. This side 17. Ready? Here we go. Go, go, go!
4921	4924	How ya doing, everybody? We brought back a friend.
4926	4930	Gentlemen, ladies, for your viewing pleasure, meet Max,
4930	4933	the magical, sexual mule!
4934	4937	A donkey that doesn't wanna be recognized?
4937	4940	Something interesting is gonna happen here.
4941	4946	And here's Max's partner. A gal who doesn't believe happiness ends with primates.
4946	4949	The lovely Miss Desiree!
4991	4994	My God! What are you people doing in here?!
4995	4997	Uh-oh. It's Mr Laughs.
5002	5006	Rick, I knew you were a vile, disgusting degenerate,
5006	5008	but bestiality?
5008	5011	This goes beyond my wildest dreams.
5011	5013	Well, I like to stretch myself on occasion.
5015	5021	You're through, mister. When Debbie hears about this, she will never see you again.
5021	5023	You're right, Mr Thompson.
5023	5029	You should go give Debbie a call right now. There's a phone in the back bedroom.
5032	5034	You're through, mister.
5036	5038	Well, thanks, pal!
5038	5041	If Debbie finds out about this, I am dead!
5041	5044	Will you relax?! I have everything under control.
5045	5047	Hired help... ladies... follow me.
5060	5065	Sorry for the interruption, folks. We now return you to the arts.
5147	5149	Stand back! I'm a doctor!
5150	5151	Back!
5161	5164	Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No.
5164	5169	I'm sorry that the noise woke you up. I will take care of it right away.
5169	5172	I've had enough of this.
5186	5189	- Let's just give 'em what they want. - What?!
5189	5192	Let's go. Come on, everybody inside!
5192	5195	The big show's gonna start in one minute. Come on!
5200	5202	We're gonna have so much fun!
5203	5205	Get outta here! Go! Go!
5206	5209	Everyone, go! I'll hold them off. The rest of you make a break for it.
5210	5212	Ilene, are you crazy? Come on, let's go!
5212	5216	Debbie, please, I know what I'm doing. Now just go. Go!
5223	5228	OK, gentlemen, the gods have answered your prayers!
5228	5230	Banzai!
5240	5244	- I hope llene is all right. - I hope those guys are all right.
5246	5248	- Oh, my God. - Ohhh!
5248	5250	Gross!
5258	5260	1002.
5309	5312	Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
5312	5313	Who?
5313	5316	Does the name Debbie mean anything to you?
5316	5318	What, my Debbie?
5319	5323	- What's with the costume? - I don't know! Listen, do me a favor.
5323	5327	Go up to her like you don't know her and send her into the back bedroom.
5327	5329	You got it.
5332	5335	Hi, baby. You're new here.
5336	5341	- I don't believe the groom has had you yet. - No, not...
5341	5345	No, not yet. Where is the groom?
5346	5347	In the bedroom.
5347	5349	Thanks.
5365	5367	Hey, it's dark in here.
5368	5372	Don't turn on the lights, sugar. I'll lead you around.
5372	5376	Oh, well, a seeing-eye hooker. This is a nice service.
5376	5382	Hey, you don't look half bad! Let's see how you are in the sack! Yeehah!
5386	5388	Damn you, Rick!
5394	5396	Debbie, you're a hooker! I don't believe it!
5396	5398	I can't trust you!
5399	5401	Come on. I knew it was you.
5404	5404	Hey!
5405	5408	- Rick, you're lying! - It was ajoke! Debbie!
5411	5413	Wait! Just hold on! Wait!
5414	5416	Hold on! Please, just give me a chance to explain!
5417	5418	Debbie!
5418	5419	Debbie!
5419	5422	Debbie, I didn't do anything!
5422	5423	Well, hardly.
5423	5428	The marriage is off! You can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life!
5428	5430	I don't want that! I want you!
5430	5433	And I want somebody who understands commitment!
5433	5436	I understand commitment! I love you!
5436	5439	- I don't believe you. - You don't? Oh, fine. Good.
5439	5441	Hey! Hey!
5441	5443	People! Attention, please!
5443	5444	Shut up!
5447	5450	Have I had sex with anyone in this room tonight?
5450	5452	No!
5453	5455	You're sure about this?
5456	5458	Yes!
5458	5461	Fine, good. Resume party.
5465	5466	Understand?
5466	5470	Now this isn't your ordinary party crowd here. There are professionals in here.
5471	5473	But I didn't want them.
5473	5475	You... you're the only one I've ever wanted.
5478	5479	Do you understand?
5480	5481	Yeah.
5492	5494	So what do we do about it?
5496	5498	Let's get naked.
5498	5500	OK.
5505	5507	No, Debbie, not that bedroom!
5510	5512	Daddy?
5512	5517	All my years as a photographer, I've never seen such a natural. The camera loves him!
5518	5519	Grrrrrr!
5520	5522	Daddy, what are you doing here?
5527	5531	He says he's having a wonderful time and thinking of changing his name to Spike.
5532	5533	Grrrrr!
5533	5538	I've been getting calls all night. God only knows what they're doing in there.
5538	5540	Open up! You're under arrest!
5542	5544	All right, boys, break it in.
5544	5547	Hold it, hold it, hold it. I've got the key.
5550	5552	Let's go! It's a raid!
5554	5556	Whoa! The cops!
5607	5608	Mom?
5611	5613	Back exit!
5617	5618	Debbie!
5620	5621	Debbie!
5625	5626	Rick!
5629	5629	Rick!
5630	5633	Diana Ross is playing next week. I got three tickets.
5633	5635	How about Boy George? The Police?
5635	5636	Oh, hi!
5636	5638	Oh, no! Not her!
5638	5640	No! No! Anything but that!
5640	5642	No, not her! Not her!
5642	5644	She pees standing up! Not her!
5650	5653	Stan! You lying dog!
5656	5658	Hey, wait a minute. Hold it.
5658	5662	What did you say, Stanley? What did you say, Stanley?
5662	5664	What did you say, Stanley?
5664	5667	You said no hookers! You said no hookers!
5667	5669	No hookers! No hookers!
5672	5673	Debbie!
5679	5680	Where is Debbie? Where is Debbie?
5686	5689	- What are you doing?! - Debbie, you'll always be mine!
5689	5691	Rick!
5691	5693	Hey, have you seen Debbie?
5693	5694	Shit! Shit!
5698	5700	Shit!
5701	5703	- I thought she was just next to you. - No.
5706	5708	Oh, shit!
5713	5715	Get outta there!
5719	5721	- Cole! - You're coming with me!
5723	5725	God, he's kidnapping her! Back to the bus!
5743	5745	Help! Rick!
5782	5784	Debbie! You're coming in with me!
5787	5789	Cole, I've had enough. How about you, huh?
5790	5792	- Come with me! - Just give it a rest.
5792	5793	No!
5793	5794	Tickets. Hey!
5818	5820	Tickets? Tickets?
5828	5831	There's 36 theaters. They could be anywhere.
5831	5833	Oh, great.
5833	5837	- Now what do we do? - Let's just split up. We'll go this way.
5837	5839	Ryko!
5840	5844	I killed the mule! I killed the...
5850	5853	What is the sense of living?
5859	5862	I'll take this theater. Ryko, take the one down there.
5865	5867	Ooh. Small theater.
5880	5881	Rick?
5881	5883	Rick!
5900	5901	What a realistic effect!
5925	5927	This is the best 3-D I've ever seen!
5928	5930	I've seen better.
5935	5936	Wow!
5959	5964	This time I'm gonna do it, and nobody's gonna stop me.
5979	5981	Fuck...!
6005	6008	Do you, Richard Ernesto Gassko,
6008	6013	take Deborah Julie Thompson as your lawful wife,
6013	6016	to have and to hold from this day forward,
6016	6019	for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
6019	6021	in sickness and in health,
6021	6023	until death do you part?
6023	6025	I sure do.
6037	6042	So by the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
6042	6044	You may kiss the bride.
6046	6051	Uh... I'm sorry. It needs something special here.
6051	6053	Hold on. Wait.
6054	6056	Oh, God Almighty!
6059	6063	How about this? Come on, we're married now. This is perfectly legal.
6063	6065	Honey!
6065	6068	Rick, stop it! Get that thing away from me!
6072	6074	Come here, Mrs Gassko.
6077	6079	Step on it, driver. We don't wanna miss our plane.
6079	6081	Right.
6081	6083	Hey, now, Brad...
