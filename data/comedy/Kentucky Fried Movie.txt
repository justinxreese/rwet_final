86	88	From the skin of adolescent ones.
88	91	The crude oil is transported in supertankers
91	94	in order more better to use the resources
94	97	again exploited nos In our country.

103	107	the oil on the well-worn combs City-dwellers.  Of what to fill

117	120	Sufficiently to provide to the needs of the city of Oakland
120	123	in California. To deal with the future needs,

171	173	Ron Butler is with local delegates
173	176	at the scene of the meeting, to cover the event.
177	179	Ron, that he happens?
185	187	Did the teachers finish to vote?

199	204	"Not - Counterpoint" with J. Fitzsimmons and S. Hamilton.
205	208	Sheila, one would say that even you and your liberal buddies
209	212	see light to the tip of the tunnel that brings closer you
212	214	of our dear President.
215	217	The intellectuals unleashed themselves,
217	222	and now that they have the power after having made use of problems
222	224	that they have themselves created,
225	229	the President makes all to revive their concerns about his/her/its case.
229	233	Sheila, you and your strip of liberals to the big heart,
234	237	won't know yourselves therefore ever that the social help
237	239	only makes aggravate the inflation
239	244	who especially affects those that you want to help?

250	253	I listen to your stupidities since months.
254	257	You can keep them and to put them to you to the ass.
257	262	And to crown the all, sit yourselves on that, John.
264	268	The professors finished to vote and the result is imminent.

277	281	II is the hour passed of 19 min., here is our daily category:
281	283	"The astrological news."
283	287	We don't try to reinforce your belief in the astrology,
287	292	but to help the incapable people to take only decisions.
292	296	If you are Balance and hesitate to make this important purchase,
296	299	wait for even some days.
299	302	Don't forget that your Moon is in Sagittarius.
302	304	It is not the moment to make some madness.
304	307	The Virgin must expect to a premature death
308	312	or to the tragic écartèlement of a near being.
312	316	Let's pitch, it is the moment ideal to disconnect the device
316	319	who maintains your daughter in life since 6 months.
319	322	If you are Taurus, go to the zoo.
322	326	And if you are Gemini as me, wait for yourselves to the unexpected.
327	329	Joyce Wilson, your astro...
332	333	Thank you, Joyce.
333	337	Judy Morton is with us since the reserve natural of San Diego.
337	341	We often received Judy, with always as much pleasure.
341	342	Welcome, Judy.
342	343	What of nine?
344	346	I brought you an Australian gerbille,
346	348	one of the rare to have been raised in captivity.
348	350	She/it is raised, doesn't she/it bite?
350	352	No, she/it is very cute.
352	354	They are very endearing. His/her/its name is Oscar.
357	359	I am going to take one of it for my youngsters.
359	361	They would make adorable animals of company
361	363	but they have indeed need to live in liberty.
363	365	Hey well... Oscar?
365	367	II is absolutely irresistible.
368	370	You have another surprise for us.
370	372	Quite.
372	376	This one is not small, but he/it is very cute.
376	379	In any case, it is my opinion. I am going to look for it.
379	380	Go there.
380	384	It is the moment that I prefer in this broadcast, because
384	386	I never know what they are going to bring me.
387	389	Look at what one brings to me!
389	391	I present you Dino.
394	395	He/it is enormous!
395	397	But you don't deceive there,
397	401	he/it is soft like a lamb because he/it has been raised in captivity.
401	403	It is for that that one could bring it here.
403	404	Is it a rare animal?
405	408	Yes, and besides we have of the pain to mate it.
409	411	You don't manage to find a female for Dino?
411	416	Not indeed, we have him presented several candidates,
416	420	but all attempts of mating failed.
420	425	It is surprising. Dino is not the most attractive party
425	428	that I saw, but a big gorilla as him...
428	431	We don't know very well what is his/her/its problem.
431	433	He/it is maybe shy,
433	436	carried naturally little on the thing or impotent.

475	477	The vote lasts since 3 hours.
477	480	The result now depends of the number of abstentions.
481	484	Already have yourselves an idea of what is going to happen?
485	487	I thought that the teachers wanted to take work,
488	491	but as Gemini, I am incapable to foresee anything.

2778	2781	But it is not important at present.
2782	2786	The important, it is that my guards accepted some bribes
2786	2788	and missed to their duty.
2789	2792	They must now prove that they deserve
2793	2795	to remain among us.

3305	3310	But my dear, you have the power to bring all alone in.
3310	3311	Indeed?
3312	3316	You only have to slap your heels three times,
3316	3320	while saying: "One is never as well as at home.
3327	3329	One is never as well that at home.

3861	3862	I would like to prove today
3863	3866	that to the evening of February 22, 1957,

3872	3875	when the rear of his/her/its vehicle has been embossed

3878	3879	Mile Rita Filagree.
3880	3883	In conclusion, your Honor, I would like that the jurors
3883	3885	listen to a strip.
3891	3895	Hey, Wally, it is terrific to be at the court.
3895	3898	The farm! One is going to make itself to bawl by the judge.
3898	3901	Mr., is the defense it lends?

3927	3929	You made me so happy!
3934	3937	We will say rightly that M. Gunwald is used in a service.
3937	3940	We are going to begin the questions with M. Hornung.
3941	3944	I have more reasons to call on your services
3944	3946	that... my wife, for example?
3947	3948	You lose 5 points.
3949	3952	You have 45 of them.
3952	3954	I yield my tower to Arlene.
3954	3958	Sorry, the time is urgent, I jump the cards.

3974	3977	in addition to your activity of picker, he/it is not true...
3977	3979	No, spoon!
3980	3981	Ah yes, spoon.
3983	3985	Evidently. Picker doesn't want anything to say.
3986	3990	Therefore Mr. Grunwald, in more of your spoon activities,
3991	3994	he/it is not exact that you are monitor of conduct?
3995	3996	No.
3996	3998	- Is it then exact? - Yes.
3999	4001	You are not monitor of conduct?
4001	4002	No.
4003	4005	I contest these questions.

4065	4066	Retained objection.
4066	4070	Mr. Hornung, Mr. Taylor, please approach the bench.
4073	4075	While the judge converses with the lawyers,
4075	4078	let's mark one pause with this message.
4083	4085	That makes our small skeptic, today?
4085	4088	She/it has the cat in the Nesson oil.
4094	4096	The judge is going to ask in M. Hornung
4096	4098	to prove the applicability of the law.
4098	4102	Mr. Hornung, you must prove the applicability of the law.
4102	4104	I not only go to prove it,
4105	4108	but to show how these facts relate to the business.
4113	4115	I call to the rod
4116	4118	Mile Rita Filagree.
4121	4124	As everybody waited for itself of it, a witness surprised!
4124	4128	Filagree mile was in the vehicle of Grunwald,

4148	4149	Yes!
4150	4153	Can you show it to me?
4153	4154	I am not able to.
4155	4157	I am not able to really.
4157	4160	Know yourselves the code pénal  in this State?
4160	4164	You would not cry, if one shouted to you over, hey?
4164	4167	Ben no! But the girls, it is not similar.
4167	4170	When a type cries, one takes it for a feeble.
4170	4173	That then, Wally. Is necessary to believe that have you reason.
4173	4175	Dear Madam,
4175	4177	to hide relative proofs
4177	4180	to a crime as hateful...
4182	4183	"Hêneux?"
4184	4185	"Aineux?"
4185	4187	II is necessary to say "Héneux."
4187	4189	One doesn't say "your Héneur."
4190	4193	No! Ladies and gentlemen, it is written here.
4193	4194	"Hyenas":
4194	4198	Carnivorous animals and nervous of Africa and Asia.
4204	4206	Watch, Wally.
