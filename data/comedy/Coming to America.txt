185	188	Good morning, your Highness.
188	192	Good morning, your Highness.
192	195	Good morning, your Highness.
196	202	- Happy birthday, your Highness. - Yes, it is my birthday.
241	243	Oha, it is my 21st birthday.
243	248	Do you think, just once, I might use the bathroom by myself?
248	252	Most amusing, sir. Wipers!
271	273	The royal penis is clean, your Highness.
329	334	His Highness must be very excited today.
334	338	Today is your 21st birthday. It means you meet your wife-to-be.
338	341	How can a man get excited about a woman he's never seen?
384	387	He certainly is quiet this morning.
388	390	He looks sad.
392	399	- Is something troubling you, my son? - No, Father.
400	406	I'm more than the exalted ruler of this land and master of all I survey.
406	409	I'm also a concerned dad.
410	416	Well, Father... Just a moment.
416	420	- What is he doing? - It looks as if he's coming here.
421	424	Wait right there, Akeem.
424	426	Rose bearers!
433	436	Akeem. Come sit.
449	452	Now, my son... Have you grown a moustache?
453	455	Jaffe, it has been a year.
457	462	- So, what is it, my son? - First of all, things like this.
462	465	- Like what? - The rose petals.
465	470	You're the son of a king, why shouldn' you walk on the petals of roses?
470	473	But if there were no rose petals, I would still be the son of a king.
474	477	Then it is settled. From this day forth,
477	483	anyone who throws roses at my son's feet will answer to me.
483	486	It is not just that, it is everything.
486	490	The cooking, the pampering, the dressing, the bathing...
490	493	Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,
493	498	but I'd like to cook for myself, dress myself, wipe my own backside.
498	504	- And why can't I find my own wife? - Aha! So that's it?
504	509	We've gone through a lot of trouble to select for you a very fine wife.
509	514	Since she was born, she was taught to walk, speak and think as a queen.
517	519	But what if I don't love her?
519	522	It's normal to feel anxiety about meeting your queen.
522	525	When I met your father, I was terrified.
525	528	I must admit, I was frightened, too.
528	532	I was so nervous, I became nauseous.
532	536	But over the years, I have grown to love your father very much.
536	541	You see, my son, there's a fine line between love and nausea.
541	544	I understand, but when I marry,
544	548	I want the woman to love me for who I am, not because of what I am.
548	553	- And who are you? - A man who's never tied his shoes.
553	558	Wrong! You're a prince who's never tied his shoes.
558	563	I tied my own shoes once. It is an overrated experience.
566	569	Good morning, your Majesty. It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.
569	572	And, Semmi, what is it now?
574	578	You look especially radiant today, your Grace.
579	585	I was remarking to my mother the other day what lovely skin the Queen has.
585	588	Semmi, don't you have somewhere you should go?
590	593	Yes, I was about to take the birthday boy for his daily workout.
593	596	Excuse me, Father. And Mother.
599	602	Have a good day, my son.
605	607	Akeem, what happened to the rose bearers?
611	616	Let's see if you can defend yourself, you sweat from a baboon's balls.
636	640	So you can have a woman who will obey your every command,
640	643	but you'd rather have a woman who has an opinion?
643	648	Only dogs are to obey. If you love your wife, you'll value her opinion.
655	659	Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir to the throne of Zamunda.
659	665	Your wife need only have a pretty face, firm backside and big breasts.
679	683	So you would share your bed, and your fortune, with a beautiful fool
683	687	That's the way it's always been with men of power. It's tradition.
691	695	It's also tradition that times must change.
713	719	Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt! Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!
761	765	- These really are delicious. - Yes, thank you.
773	775	Your Majesty.
776	779	I am Colonel Issy.
779	785	And today, with your blessing, I offer my daughter to your son.
788	792	My blessing is granted. Let the courtship commence.
793	799	Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming through. Excuse me. Out of the way!
803	808	Greetings, great Prince. Presenting Miss Imani Issi.
936	943	She's your Queen-to-be
943	947	A Queen-to-be forever
947	951	A Queen who'll do whatever
951	956	His Highness desires
956	962	She's your Queen-to-be
963	967	A vision of perfection
967	970	Ah object of affection
971	975	To quench your royal fire
975	981	Completely free from infection
982	985	To be used at your discretion
985	992	Waiting only for your direction
993	1001	Your Queen-to-be
1018	1022	May I talk to you alone for a moment, please?
1025	1029	Excuse us for a moment.
1060	1064	- So... - Am I not all you dreamed I would be?
1064	1066	You're fine. Beautiful
1066	1071	But if we're going to be married, we should talk and get to know each other.
1071	1076	Ever since I was born, I have been trained to serve you.
1076	1081	I know, but I'd like to know about you. What do you like to do?
1081	1084	Whatever you like.
1084	1089	- What kind of music do you like? - Whatever kind of music you like.
1090	1094	I know what I like, and you know what I like, 'cause you were trained to know,
1094	1098	but I would like to know what you like. Do you have a favourite food?
1098	1101	Good! What is your favourite food?
1101	1104	Whatever food you like.
1105	1109	This is impossible. I command you not to obey me.
1110	1112	No.
1113	1117	Are you saying that no matter what I tell you to do, you will do?
1117	1119	Yes, your Highness.
1119	1123	- Ahything I say, you'll do? - Yes, your Highness.
1124	1126	Bark like a dog.
1129	1131	A big dog.
1134	1137	Hop on one leg.
1139	1142	Make a noise like an orang-utan.
1145	1149	I see the two of you are getting along.
1152	1155	Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.
1165	1169	Fine girl, isn't she? I told you not to worry.
1170	1172	Father...
1175	1178	About this wedding...
1178	1180	The guests are waiting, your Majesty.
1181	1185	Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.
1187	1189	Come. Let's go for a stroll.
1202	1205	Hello, Babar.
1210	1216	Time flies. It seems only yesterday I ordered your first diaper changed,
1216	1220	and now you're a man who's about to be married.
1221	1224	She will give you much pleasure, don't you think?
1225	1228	I'm not sure if I'm ready.
1229	1232	I know we never had a talk about this,
1232	1237	but I always assumed you had sex with your bathers. I know I do.
1237	1243	It's not that. I'm 21 years old, and I have never left Zamunda.
1243	1247	I have yet to experience what the outside world has to offer.
1248	1251	- So you want to sow your royal oats? - No, it's not that...
1252	1255	You're right! Get out, see the world. Enjoy yourself.
1256	1261	Fulfil every erotic desire, and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.
1261	1264	- But, Father... - it is settled.
1279	1282	May I have your attention, please?
1284	1288	The wedding will proceed in 40 days. You may go home now. Good night.
1288	1292	Oha. Prepare the royal baggage. My son is going on a trip.
1295	1298	Prepare the royal baggage!
1301	1305	This trip is an excellent idea. 40 days of fornication.
1305	1311	Semmi. I have something else in mind. I intend to find my bride.
1312	1317	What is wrong with the one you have? Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?
1317	1321	I want a woman who will arouse my intellect as well as my loins.
1321	1324	- Where would you find such a woman? - In America.
1328	1330	The land is so big, the choices so infinite.
1331	1335	Where shall we go? Los Ahgeles or New York?
1335	1338	We'll let fate decide.
1340	1343	Heads, New York. Tails, Los Ahgeles.
1346	1349	We go to New York.
1349	1353	But where in New York can one find a woman with grace and elegance?
1354	1356	A woman suitable for a king.
1360	1361	Queens!
1378	1383	Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please p¡ck up a white courtesy telephone.
1388	1392	No one here can know I am royalty. I must appear as an average man.
1392	1395	I will not say a word.
1409	1411	Halt!
1412	1415	You dumb fuck!
1419	1422	Take us to Queens at once.
1425	1431	Do you want to go to Queens? Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.
1431	1433	Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.
1433	1437	- Take us to the Palace. - No, I want Queens.
1437	1441	And we're not rich. We're ordinary African students.
1441	1444	Whatever you say, pal
1444	1450	- What part of Queens do you want? - Take us to the most common part.
1451	1456	That's easy. If there's one thing Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.
1458	1460	What does "dumb fuck" mean?
1491	1494	- Is this shitty enough for you? - Yes, this is perfect.
1531	1536	Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.
1538	1544	America is great indeed. A country so free, one can throw glass on the street.
1544	1548	You must be out of your goddamn m¡nd!
1550	1551	Listen. Real Americans.
1553	1556	Sugar Ray Robinson's the greatest fighter that ever lived.
1556	1559	- What about Joe Louis? - "The Brown Bomber".
1559	1563	- That was a great boxer. - You're damn right.
1563	1566	I suppose nobody in here ever heard of Cassius Clay.
1566	1569	He's got a point. Cassius Clay was a bad motherfucker.
1569	1570	I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.
1570	1575	I stopped liking him when he changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
1575	1578	Wait a second. Wait a second.
1578	1583	A man has the right to change his name to whatever he wants to change it to.
1583	1587	And if a man wants to be called Muhammad Ali,
1587	1593	you should respect his wishes and call the man Muhammad Ali.
1593	1596	His momma named him Clay. I'm going to call him Clay.
1597	1600	- I say Clay. - Get out of here.
1600	1606	He'll always be Clay to me. I don' care what he change his name to.
1606	1609	Well, then you're a putz. The three of you. Three putzes.
1609	1614	You should change the name from "My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".
1626	1630	- What the fuck do you want? - We desire a room.
1630	1634	You'd better not be wasting my time. You got money?
1636	1638	Come on in, gentlemen.
1641	1644	Yo, man! Get the big bag.
1648	1653	Excuse me if I was brusque, but we get boo-boos in here without a dollar.
1654	1658	Obviously, you gentlemen came in on another boat.
1658	1661	- We seek meagre accommodations. - Excuse me?
1662	1664	We require a room that is very poor.
1669	1672	Hey, Stu. Your rent's due, motherfucker.
1672	1678	And don't pull that falling down the stairs shit on me. You're conscious.
1678	1681	Every month, the same damn thing...
1698	1701	Here we are.
1702	1707	There's only one bathroom on this floor, so you have to share it.
1709	1715	Got a bit of an insect problem, but you boys from Africa are used to that.
1716	1720	And don't use the elevator. It's a death trap.
1720	1725	This is the place that I was telling you about. It's real fucked up.
1725	1730	The window faces a brick wall. I used to rent it to a blind man.
1739	1743	It's a damn shame what they did to that dog.
1748	1750	We will take the room.
1750	1753	Yes.
1768	1771	Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.
1771	1775	A thing that we have been denied for far too long.
1777	1780	- Good morn¡ng, my ne¡ghbours! - Fuck you!
1780	1786	Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!
1805	1809	I suspect that these are the people that have stolen our luggage.
1814	1816	Do you want to buy some toothbrushes?
1816	1822	I've got some real fly personal hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.
1822	1825	Thief! Stop thief! Come back, thief!
1825	1828	- Semmi, let him go. - Those things belong to us.
1829	1833	It's good we're rid of those things. Let them wear our princely robes.
1833	1837	We're in New York now. Let us dress as New Yorkers.
1843	1848	- I feel like a complete idiot. - Don't be ridiculous.
1848	1855	You know, you can be all the th¡ngs you've always wanted to be.
1855	1858	Beautiful, sexy...
1859	1861	One, two, three...
1882	1884	Soul Glo.
1886	1889	Perhaps I should cut off my prince's lock.
1891	1894	You're out of your mind! Joe Louis is the greatest boxer that ever lived.
1894	1896	I'll be with you in a minute.
1896	1901	He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray and that new boy - Mike Tyson.
1902	1905	He was better than him, too. He'd whip all their asses!
1906	1910	- What about Rocky Marciano? - There they go. There they go.
1910	1915	Every time I talk about boxing, a white man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.
1915	1919	That's their one, that's their one. "Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"
1919	1922	Let me tell you something. Rocky Marciano was good,
1922	1925	but compared to Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano ain't shit!
1926	1928	He beat Joe Louis' ass.
1928	1933	- He did whop Joe Louis' ass. - Joe Louis was 75 years old!
1933	1935	I don't know how old he was, but he got his ass whooped.
1935	1939	Joe Louis came out of retirement to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.
1940	1942	Joe Louis always lied about his age.
1943	1945	Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.
1945	1948	I said, "Y ou hang out with Joe Louis. How old is he?"
1948	1953	Frank said, "Joe Louis is 137 years old".
1953	1957	Oh, man. You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.
1959	1962	Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you! Who's next?
1971	1973	What's that? Some kind of weave or something?
1973	1976	It's my natural hair. I've been growing it since birth.
1978	1980	What kind of chemicals you got in there?
1980	1983	None, only juices and berries.
1983	1988	That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm. How do you want it cut?
1990	1992	Just make it nice and neat.
2001	2004	That'll be 8 dollars.
2012	2016	Tell me, Semmi. Honestly... How do I look?
2019	2021	It is time to find your queen.
2053	2056	I've got a secret.
2056	2058	I worship the devil
2063	2068	See, that's the problem. I can't find a man that can satisfy me.
2068	2072	Some guys go an hour, hour and a half. That's it.
2072	2077	A man's got to put in overtime for me to get off.
2077	2081	I'm not interested in a man unless he drives a B.M.W.
2081	2085	Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single. My husband's on Death Row.
2086	2092	This is the first date Teresa and I have been on since the doctor separated us.
2093	2097	I'm into the group thing.
2098	2102	I was Joan of Arc in my former life.
2106	2108	My name is Peaches And I'm the best
2108	2111	All the D.J. S want to feel my breasts
2116	2120	I want to work in videos, but I want to be my own star in the video,
2120	2125	because I want to be a pop singer, a rock singer, and write my own songs.
2126	2130	And then I'm going to try an actress, 'cause people tell me I'm a natural
2130	2136	Then I'm going to write and direct my own stories, produce the movies...
2149	2152	I hope you don't mind me coming over and sitting down.
2152	2157	But I've been watching you all evening, and I want to tear you apart.
2159	2162	And your friend, too.
2166	2171	Does every woman in New York have a severe emotional problem?
2171	2174	I doubt we will ever find your queen.
2176	2181	- Mr Clarence. - The boys from Africa! How are you?
2182	2187	- Where can one find nice women here? - You've got to get out and look.
2187	2189	We've been to every bar in Queens.
2189	2192	You can't go to no bar to find a nice woman.
2192	2198	You've got to go to nice places, like the library and church.
2198	2201	Or this place, where I'm going tonight. The Black Awareness Rally.
2201	2205	There's going to be some fine women there. Clean girls.
2212	2215	I didn't come here to preach to you today.
2220	2226	But when I look at these contestants for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,
2227	2232	I feel good, 'cause I know there's a God somewhere.
2233	2235	There's a God somewhere.
2235	2237	Turn around, ladies.
2237	2242	You know there's a God who sits up high, and looks down low.
2242	2245	Man cannot make it like this.
2245	2248	Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner... They can take the picture,
2248	2254	but they can't make it. Only God above can make it for ya.
2254	2259	These are the best women Queens has to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.
2259	2261	Be patient, my friend.
2261	2265	Do you love him? Do you feel joy? Say "joy"!
2265	2268	- Joy! - Joy.
2268	2270	- Joy! - Joy!
2270	2275	- Can I get a "Amen"? - Amen, brother!
2276	2278	Don't be ashamed to call his name.
2279	2280	Yes, Lord!
2280	2284	Only God can give that woman that kind of joy.
2286	2290	- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. - Joy!
2290	2293	- I am very happy to be here. - Amen!
2296	2298	Can I get a "Amen"?
2300	2305	I don't know what you've come to do, but I've come to praise His name.
2307	2309	Lord, Lord...
2311	2315	Girls, you can leave now. Thank you very much.
2315	2318	There's a God somewhere.
2319	2322	I've got a special treat for you this evening.
2322	2326	A young man, that you all know as Joe the policeman
2326	2330	from the "What's Going Down" episode of "That's My Momma".
2330	2334	I want you to put your hands together and welcome him to the stage.
2335	2339	A big round of applause for Jackson Height's own
2339	2344	Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.
2344	2348	- That boy's good. - Good and terrible.
2349	2351	And Reverend Brown.
2351	2355	He's been my reverend since I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.
2356	2361	You're a very special man. Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.
2363	2369	It feels so lovely to be here tonight. Give yourselves a round of applause.
2369	2374	Give a big round of applause to my band, Sexual Chocolate.
2378	2382	Sexual Chocolate. They play so fine, don't you agree?
2402	2406	- Some of the good stuff? Coming up. - Do you want a Coke?
2408	2412	- Enjoying the show? - Enjoy, young man.
2439	2442	Sexy Chocolate!
2444	2445	Sexy Chocolate!
2450	2455	- Goddamn, that boy can sing. - You must be crazy.
2464	2467	Put your hands together for Mr Randy Watson.
2467	2471	Yeah, one more time! Randy Watson, how about it!
2471	2476	Before we go any further, I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,
2476	2481	who's responsible for the fine food and beverage here tonight.
2481	2485	Cleo, I know you're proud of your daughters. We are, too.
2485	2488	Please welcome one of the organisers of tonight's festivities.
2488	2492	Miss Lisa McDowell. Lisa, come up here, baby girl
2492	2497	- Work in a plug for the new salad bar. - I'm not mentioning the restaurant.
2497	2500	At least give them the address.
2503	2509	Someone ought to put you on a plate and suck you up with a biscuit.
2512	2518	Black Awareness Week is an opportunity for self -expression.
2518	2521	- May we leave now? - No, wait.
2521	2527	...express himself through song. In his own unique way, but...
2528	2530	The song makes a good point.
2531	2533	The ch¡ldren are our future,
2533	2538	and it's up to all of us to provide a place where children can express themselves.
2539	2543	We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.
2544	2550	Ushers are passing with donation baskets, so please - give all you can.
2551	2554	We're happy to get the kind of money that jingles,
2555	2557	but we'd rather get the kind that folds.
2567	2570	- Donations. Donations! - I thought it was the trash.
2570	2572	- Stupid ass. - I'll whip your ass.
2573	2578	- You tar-black motherfucker. - There's women here. Calm down.
2590	2593	Thank you.
2596	2600	- She is wonderful - Akeem...
2601	2605	You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell, at McDowell's Restaurant,
2606	2610	8507, Queens Boulevard.
2610	2613	8507, Queens Boulevard.
2625	2628	Your first job every morning will be to sweep this walkway.
2629	2633	Then I want you to wash all the windows. Real good, too.
2633	2636	And don't leave no streaks.
2639	2642	What are you doing?
2644	2647	Get the hell out of here before I bust that camera!
2651	2656	Me and the McDonald's people, we've got this little misunderstanding.
2659	2664	See, they're "McDonald's". I'm "McDowell's".
2666	2671	They've got the golden arches. Mine are the golden arcs.
2674	2677	They've got the Big Mac. I've got the Big Mick.
2677	2682	We both got two all -beef patties, sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.
2682	2688	But they use a sesame seed bun. My buns have no seeds.
2690	2692	I've got it.
2695	2700	You've got to mop the food-prep area twice a day.
2700	2703	- Do you know how to mop? - Yes, of course.
2704	2706	There you go.
2720	2724	Don't use the bucket. It'll just confuse you.
2725	2729	When you get through here, you take out the trash.
2729	2733	Come with me, I've got an easy job for you.
2763	2767	- Hi! - Hello.
2770	2772	Hello.
2773	2775	Hi...
2776	2779	I am Akeem.
2781	2784	It's nice to meet you, Akeem.
2784	2789	I've been placed in charge of garbage. Do you have any that needs disposal
2790	2793	No, it's totally empty.
2794	2799	When it fills up, don't be afraid to call me. I'll take it out urgently.
2801	2802	That's good to know.
2803	2807	When you think of garbage, think of Akeem.
2809	2812	Well, I have to get back to my sanitation duties.
2813	2818	Maybe we will have a chance to talk again on a professional level
2819	2822	Goodbye, Akeem.
2880	2884	Darryl You're looking sharp.
2884	2888	How about a Mick-Shake? I believe strawberry is your favourite.
2889	2890	Straw.
2890	2895	Lisa's in the back. She's waiting for you. Come on.
2897	2901	- How's everything at Soul Glo? - Fine.
2901	2904	Our home weave products are really taking off.
2904	2909	Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets game. I thought you might enjoy them.
2910	2913	That's very considerate of you. Thank you!
2916	2919	- Lisa! Look who's here, honey. - Hi!
2919	2923	You two kids have a good time, you hear?
2928	2929	- Ready? - Sure.
2930	2933	I want to ask you something.
2933	2939	At the rally, someone stuck a large amount of cash in one of the boxes.
2939	2942	You wouldn't happen to know who that was, would you?
2944	2948	- Well, I... - I thought it was you!
2949	2952	You know me. Ahything for the kids.
2959	2961	- Hi, guys. - Hello.
2965	2970	I got four tickets to the St. John's game. Maybe your sister can bring someone.
2970	2973	Take care of this, will you?
2985	2989	- Excuse me. - Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.
2993	2996	What can I do you for?
2999	3003	- Can you make my hair look like this? - Why would you want that?
3003	3005	I like your hair, it's natural
3005	3009	I wish more children would wear their hair natural, like Martin Luther King.
3009	3015	You ain't never seen Martin Luther King with no messy curls on his head.
3015	3020	- I met Dr Martin Luther King once. - You're lying, you ain't never met him.
3020	3023	I met him in 1962 in Memphis, Tennessee.
3023	3026	I'm walking down the street minding my own business.
3026	3029	I walk round the corner, and a man hits me in the chest.
3029	3032	I fall on the ground. I look up, and it's Martin Luther King.
3032	3035	I said, "Dr King." He said, "Oops, I thought it was someone else."
3036	3038	- You never met Martin Luther King. - He knocked me over.
3039	3041	- No, he didn'. - Yes, he did.
3041	3043	Why do you worry about how you look?
3043	3048	I'm trying to gain the interest of a certain young lady.
3048	3051	I ain't heard no woman give no man no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.
3051	3055	- That's right. - Is this an American girl
3057	3061	You got to go through her papa. People don't know that about American women.
3061	3063	Ain't nothing to do with your hair or your pocket.
3063	3067	You get in good with American woman's father, you in good with her.
3068	3071	Get in good with the father, you home free.
3071	3074	- Home free. - Like a bird.
3085	3088	- Mr McDowell. - What is it?
3088	3093	Sir, did you catch the professional football contest on television last night?
3095	3098	- No, I didn'. - It was most exhilarating.
3098	3101	The Giants of New York took on the Packers of Green Bay.
3101	3106	The Giants triumphed by kicking an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".
3106	3109	It was a ripping victory.
3111	3115	Son, and I'm just going to tell you this one time.
3115	3118	You want to keep working here, stay off the drugs.
3120	3122	Yes, sir.
3128	3132	I don't know how it is in Africa, but here rich guys get all the chicks.
3138	3142	- He must work very hard. - The Prince of Soul Glo?
3142	3147	No way. He lives off his father's invention.
3147	3152	He can buy her anything he wants. How are you going to compete with that?
3179	3182	I'll get it.
3189	3192	- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell. - I'll take it, I'm her sister.
3193	3195	Would you sign here, please?
3203	3207	- What is it? - Something for you.
3207	3210	Do you mind if I open it?
3215	3218	- Do you think they're real - They couldn't be.
3221	3224	"From an admirer. Not Darryl"
3225	3228	- Somebody's messing around. - I am not.
3229	3231	I don't care how much a man admires you.
3231	3235	He's not giving you earrings like that unless you've given him booty.
3235	3241	- Not everybody thinks like you. - They do, but they don't admit it.
3258	3262	Do you realise I have not had sex since we got to America?
3263	3265	Semmi, look. There she is.
3266	3269	- I'm going to talk to her. - Good.
3269	3272	Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar pair of earrings.
3272	3276	She will fall into your arms, and we can leave this god-forsaken place.
3276	3278	- I cannot do that. - Do something.
3278	3283	- Do not worry, I have a plan. - To mop your way into her heart?
3283	3287	- That's not fair. - Nor is me doing manual labour.
3289	3292	- I'm badly in need of a manicure. - Listen to you...
3292	3295	"I'm badly in need of a manicure."
3295	3299	Are you going to say something?
3302	3307	- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice. - Hello, how are you?
3307	3311	- Akeem's from Africa. - What are you doing in New York?
3311	3315	- I'm a student. - What school are you going to?
3315	3318	I go to the University.
3318	3319	Which one?
3322	3324	The University of the United States.
3326	3328	I've never heard of that.
3329	3332	It's a very small university. We don't even have a basketball team.
3332	3338	Really? We've got an extra ticket for the St. John's game. Want to come?
3339	3341	Yes.
3341	3345	You can double -date with me and Darryl
3370	3373	In his face! In his face!
3373	3376	Yes! In the face!
3379	3382	Why don't you take off yourjacket, Akeem?
3383	3386	"Put it in the face," right? I like this.
3387	3390	- Isn't that better? - Yes, thank you very much.
3398	3402	Wearing clothes must be a new experience for you.
3402	3406	- Are you able to follow the game? - Oh, yes!
3406	3409	I'm following the game quite well.
3411	3415	What kind of games do you play in Africa? Chase the monkey?
3417	3420	No, we play football. I believe you call it soccer.
3420	3422	Yeah, right. Soccer.
3422	3428	That's a real cute sport. Especially the way you bounce the ball off your heads.
3428	3432	I don't like any sport where you don't use your hands.
3434	3436	Yes! Yes!
3436	3440	What are you doing? It's just the half -time?
3441	3445	This is my favourite part of the game. Will you excuse me for a moment?
3445	3449	Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.
3464	3467	Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness, it is you!
3468	3470	I cannot believe it.
3473	3477	- Greetings, your Highness. - Please, stop bowing.
3477	3482	- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda. - You will spill your beverages.
3483	3486	This is the greatest day of my life.
3487	3491	It was very nice meeting you, too. Excuse me.
3494	3499	Please! Please, may I just have my picture taken with you?
3511	3516	I will cherish this experience for the rest of my life.
3522	3525	For the rest of my life.
3527	3532	- Who was that? - Just a man I met in the restroom.
3539	3544	- Why don't you quit this job? - Because I like it here.
3544	3548	But you're my lady. My lady doesn't have to work.
3549	3553	I'll take care of you. Get you anything you want.
3554	3557	- What can I get you? - Nothing.
3559	3562	I'll get you some... coffee.
3563	3566	I'll be right back.
3573	3576	Hey, Akeem. Did you have a good time at the game?
3576	3578	Yes, I did.
3578	3581	I hope Darryl didn't offend you. He can be pretty obnoxious.
3582	3586	- He cannot help it. - Sit down, take a break for a minute.
3589	3592	You're an unusual guy.
3592	3595	I've never seen anybody take so much pride in mopping a floor.
3595	3600	"He who would learn to fly must first learn to stand and walk."
3600	3605	"One cannot fly into flying." That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.
3605	3609	That's what I mean. The guys that work here don't quote Nietzsche.
3614	3617	Everybody shut up and do what I say.
3617	3622	Get the money out! Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.
3622	3625	Take the money out! All of it.
3625	3628	Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.
3628	3632	Come on! You're wasting my time. Come on!
3635	3638	Ahybody move, I'll blow your fucking head off.
3638	3642	What are you looking at, buddy?
3643	3647	Come on! Stop stalling.
3650	3654	Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!
3659	3663	- Come on! - Excuse me for a moment.
3669	3671	It would be wise for you to put the weapon down.
3671	3673	Who is this asshole?
3675	3680	Please refrain from using any more obscenities in front of these people.
3680	3682	I've warned you. I'll be forced to thrash you.
3683	3685	Fuck you!
3690	3694	Freeze, you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.
3706	3711	Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job you did in there today.
3711	3713	We've been hit by that guy five times,
3714	3719	but I don't think he's coming back, thanks to my African connections.
3720	3726	Leave Sunday night open. I'm having a get-together at my house.
3728	3730	You see? He has accepted us as equals.
3733	3737	OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their keys and park the cars down the street.
3738	3740	When you're finished, come inside and help out in the kitchen.
3741	3746	Akeem, I want to show you the inside of McDowell's little castle.
3751	3756	This here is my showplace. It pretty much speaks for itself.
3758	3764	When I grew up, nine of us lived in a shack no bigger than this room.
3765	3768	And look what I have today.
3768	3772	I only wish Mrs McDowell could have lived to see it.
3772	3776	- You have a fine house, sir. - Thank you.
3776	3781	In 20 or 30 years, with hard work, maybe you could have a place like this.
3785	3788	- That would be something. - Wouldn't it?
3792	3795	This is where you're going to be working tonight.
3804	3809	- Ever open a champagne bottle? - I have seen it done before.
3809	3812	Make sure you keep all the glasses full.
3812	3816	I'd better get dressed. Make yourself comfortable 'til the guests arrive.
3819	3825	I love the Lord. Do you understand what I'm saying? I love the Lord.
3825	3829	And if loving the Lord is wrong, I don't want to be right.
3829	3835	Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink up. Lots more where that came from.
3835	3839	Hey, Randy! Good to see you. Watch out for this guy.
3840	3841	Big Ed, my man!
3842	3847	You know, I can appreciate the way you handled that dude with the gun.
3847	3850	I would've helped you out, except...
3851	3854	I had a cup of coffee in my hand. You understand, right?
3854	3860	I bet you learnt all that stuff fighting lions and tigers and shit.
3860	3863	Yes, where I'm from, we have to be very aggressive.
3864	3867	I'm all for that. Especially with women.
3868	3871	They may not admit it...
3871	3876	...but they all want a man to take charge.
3881	3884	Tell them what to do.
3891	3894	That's one of the things I want to talk to you...
3894	3898	Darryl, your mother gets lovelier every time I see her.
3899	3904	- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone. - Sure. Excuse us.
3904	3907	- Mum, Dad, Grandma... - Sure, son.
3907	3912	I like the fries better at McDonald's, but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.
3914	3917	Make sure everybody's glass is kept full.
3917	3921	We're about to make a very special announcement.
3925	3929	May I have everyone's attention, please.
3932	3938	Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me? Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.
3947	3950	I've just heard some news that makes me a very happy man.
3951	3952	Semmi, please...
3955	3957	Champagne.
3958	3961	- Thank you. - Thank you.
3961	3965	Okay, get going. Get out of here. Go on.
3967	3973	As you know, Darryl and Lisa have been going together for quite some time.
3973	3978	I'm pleased to announce that Darryl just popped the big question.
3980	3984	And Lisa happily accepted.
3991	3995	So as it turns out, this has become an engagement party.
3995	3999	Amen! Praise the Lord.
3999	4003	- Married? - To the bride and groom.
4004	4006	To the bride and groom!
4006	4008	To the bride and groom.
4015	4020	I want you and that young man to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.
4020	4023	And I want you to hold on to God's unchanging hand.
4023	4027	'Cause he helped Joshua fight the battle of Jericho.
4028	4031	And he helped Daniel get out of the lion's den.
4031	4035	He helped Gilligan get off the island. Lord!
4035	4038	I want to talk to you, now!
4048	4054	The next time you and my father plan my life, let me in on it.
4054	4056	- It's not like... - Don't touch me!
4056	4060	But baby, it's our engagement party.
4071	4073	Thanks.
4080	4086	- Would you like some champagne? - No, I don't feel like celebrating.
4088	4093	Wait. Sit down and keep me company.
4101	4105	If you're going to hang out with me, you've got to loosen up.
4105	4108	I can be loose. See?
4110	4112	Much better.
4113	4116	- Are you all right? - I'm fine.
4116	4121	But I won't be pressured into marriage, not by Darryl, my father or anybody.
4122	4126	I understand. In my country they arrange marriages,
4126	4129	but no one should marry out of obligation.
4129	4134	You're right. How could I even have considered marrying a guy like Darryl
4135	4140	- I wondered the same thing. - He made me so furious back there.
4141	4146	- Do you think I overreacted? - The first reaction is often correct.
4147	4152	You're very easy to talk to. I feel like I could tell you anything.
4157	4162	Hey, Akeem. We need some more champagne over here.
4164	4167	I almost forgot that I was here in a domestic capacity.
4167	4172	Thanks for listening to me, Akeem. I really appreciate it.
4172	4175	Ahy time, Lisa McDowell.
4180	4183	Hey! Be careful
4184	4187	I think my sister likes you.
4194	4196	Semmi!
4199	4201	Semmi.
4206	4212	- Come, you're going to be late for work. - So what if I am?
4212	4217	We cannot anger Mr McDowell. Things are going so well with Lisa.
4217	4221	I do not care. I'm not going to work today.
4222	4225	Yes, you are going to work today.
4226	4228	I'm sick of living like a peasant. Look at this filth.
4228	4233	Do you want to live better? Fine. Fix this place up.
4233	4236	But you are going to work today!
4246	4248	- Hello! - Hi!
4248	4252	I started on clean-up just like you guys, but now...
4252	4257	See, I'm washing lettuce. Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.
4258	4261	In a year or two, I'll make assistant manager
4261	4264	and that's where the big bucks start rolling in.
4265	4268	Just two years, huh?
4271	4277	Maybe I've stayed with him because everyone expected me to.
4277	4281	- You must be tired of my problems. - No, not at all.
4282	4285	I feel like I owe you a favour.
4285	4290	Come to my house and I'll fix you dinner. Patrice will be there.
4290	4295	Let's go to my house. I'd like to cook for you.
4295	4298	- You cook? - I dabble a little, yes.
4299	4301	Great! Tell you what, I'll buy the groceries.
4302	4307	Fine. But I have to warn you. My home is very poor.
4307	4312	I don't care about that. I'd love to see where you live.
4325	4328	Welcome to my humble abode.
4337	4341	- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
4341	4345	Everything's fine. Excuse me for a moment, please.
4349	4353	- What have you done? - You told me to fix up the place.
4355	4359	I should kill you! I'm supposed to be a poor man.
4359	4362	Akeem? Akeem.
4365	4367	- Is everything all right? - Everything is fine.
4367	4370	Excuse me, I have to tidy up.
4386	4389	What are you doing?
4391	4395	For God's sake, do not take my pocket money.
4399	4402	If you have no more money, you can cause no more mischief.
4403	4405	You are being unreasonable.
4406	4412	If you have ruined my chances with Lisa, I will never forgive you.
4415	4417	- I'm very sorry. - Can we go in now?
4418	4421	- No, we cannot. - Why not?
4421	4424	There's a big rat inside.
4424	4427	I think there is no rat.
4427	4433	You're so ashamed of your apartment you can't even let me see it.
4433	4436	Once again, you have judged correctly.
4437	4441	- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat. - That would be much better.
4467	4470	Excuse me for a moment, please.
4479	4484	- What did you give him? - I just gave him some pocket change.
4499	4502	- Randolph... - Leave me alone, Mortimer.
4502	4505	Randolph! Randolph!
4507	4511	- I'm still not talking to you. - Look!
4518	4521	Mortimer, we're back.
4522	4524	Yeah!
4525	4527	To America!
4532	4534	Why did you come here?
4534	4537	- To find something special - it's a long way to travel
4538	4542	No journey is too great, when one finds what he seeks.
4543	4547	- Does everyone in Africa talk like you? - Why, do you not like it?
4547	4553	I love it. It's nice to be with a man who knows how to express himself.
4554	4556	- Thank you! - Thank you very much!
4556	4558	Let's have lunch.
4562	4565	You have the most amazing effect on people.
4565	4570	- No, I don'. - Take the guy at the basketball game.
4571	4573	People love you.
4574	4579	I bet where you're from, women throw themselves at your feet.
4579	4585	- Why do you say that? - You have an inner glow.
4585	4589	You're above anything petty. It's almost regal
4593	4600	- What did you do back home? - I was... in the family business.
4600	4604	- What's that? - Goat herding.
4605	4608	Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?
4609	4612	No, it's just that you seem so educated.
4612	4617	The life of a goat herder is easy, the goats take care of themselves.
4617	4621	Which leaves a man with a great deal of time to read.
4624	4628	- Please, let me. - No, I should pay.
4628	4632	Akeem, I wish you'd stop worrying about being poor.
4632	4636	If I wanted a wealthy guy, I'd be with Darryl
4636	4638	Not you.
4644	4648	- Would you like to dance? - Yes.
4676	4679	What about Patrice?
4679	4682	I'm not interested in Patrice.
4684	4686	What about Darryl
4687	4690	I'm not interested in Darryl, either.
4716	4720	- Do you actually want to send this? - Why? What is wrong?
4720	4722	Read it to me.
4722	4728	"To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer, the Royal Palace, Zamunda."
4728	4732	"Sire, Akeem and I have depleted our funds."
4732	4736	"Kindly send 300,000 American dollars immediately,"
4737	4741	"as we are in dire straits. Your humble servant, Semmi."
4741	4743	Semmi.
4744	4748	- Should I make it 400,000? - Do you think that'll be enough?
4749	4751	You are right. 500,000.
4752	4756	As long as you're asking, why not go for a cool million?
4756	4760	- Don't you think that's too much? - Nah.
4766	4769	Okay, what's going on?
4769	4772	Patrice...
4774	4776	I came to see Akeem.
4776	4780	What are you involved in? You can't afford this on your salary.
4783	4788	Someone to kiss Someone to miss
4788	4792	When you're away Through here, gone each day
4792	4797	To be loved, to be loved Wow! What a feeling
4798	4803	- Qu¡et! People are try¡ng to sleep. - Some w¡sh to be a k¡ng or a queen
4803	4806	- Some w¡sh for fortune and fame - Shut up!
4806	4811	But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved
4811	4815	it must mean all of these things
4817	4821	Someone to care Someone to share
4821	4826	Lonely hours and moments of despair
4826	4832	To be loved, to be loved Wow! What a feeling
4833	4837	Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...
4838	4843	Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.
4844	4849	Sorry things didn't work out between you and me, but you understand.
4849	4853	Goodnight, sweet prince.
4860	4863	Remember, you must not tell a soul
4863	4868	Your secret is safe with me, your Highness. Bye...
4876	4879	If you're the prince, then who am I
4882	4885	My servant.
4897	4901	They smell good. Darryl must be spending a fortune on flowers.
4901	4904	Stay out of this, Dad.
4904	4908	- Where are you going? - To a museum. With Akeem.
4908	4912	- I don't like that one bit. - What's wrong with Akeem?
4913	4916	You told me yourself. He's a goat herder.
4918	4923	Why don't you marry Darryl He dresses nice, he treats you good.
4923	4926	You only like Darryl because he's rich.
4928	4932	I don't want you to have to struggle like your mother and I did.
4932	4935	I know. Bye, Daddy.
4942	4945	Come in.
4947	4952	- You boys wanted to see me. - We would like to change apartments.
4953	4956	Goddamn! What the hell have you done in here?
4956	4961	My friend Semmi has altered the apartment, so we would like to change.
4961	4963	This stuff ain't hot, is it?
4963	4969	No, but I'm bringing a young lady up, and she can't see me living like this.
4971	4977	I'll let you boys stay in my apartment and I'll move up here.
4977	4982	- Does your apartment look poor? - It's a real shithole. You'll love it.
4984	4989	Here are the keys. It's apartment 1 A. Downstairs. First floor.
4990	4993	Thank you, you're too kind. Semmi, move our things.
5001	5005	I have a date with Lisa. Isn't that wonderful
5084	5087	Who in the hell is that?
5097	5103	What's up, brother? You're a little late for the Christmas pageant.
5107	5110	I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.
5110	5115	Have a seat. Chair number two will be ready in a second.
5118	5121	This is beautiful What is that - velvet?
5123	5125	I have come for my son Akeem.
5125	5130	- Who? - You know, Kunta.
5130	5137	- The boy upstairs. - He live upstairs on the fifth floor.
5139	5142	Who's going to clean up the flowers?
5152	5154	You may enter.
5161	5165	- You are not Akeem. - I know that.
5173	5177	- What is this? - A photograph.
5177	5179	What is this "McDowell's"?
5179	5184	It's a place over on Queens Boulevard. I think he works there.
5185	5188	My son works?!
5188	5193	- Where is he now? - He moved to apartment 1 A.
5205	5208	Your Majesty. What are you doing here?
5208	5211	I received your telegram. Where is Akeem?
5213	5217	He went out. How was your flight? Comfortable, I trust.
5217	5222	Yourjob was to look after Akeem. How could you let this happen?
5222	5226	Akeem will not listen to me, he's gone quite mad.
5227	5229	Semmi...
5229	5234	You've disgraced yourself, and you must be punished.
5235	5240	You will confine yourself to our royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.
5240	5245	See that he puts on some decent attire. And bathe him thoroughly.
5251	5254	Thank you, your Majesty!
5256	5260	Look, Zamunda! That's where you're from, isn't it?
5260	5264	- What's it like? - It's the most beautiful place on earth.
5264	5270	The people are very friendly, and you... You, they would treat like a queen.
5276	5279	People will see us.
5279	5282	Then let them see. Lisa...
5282	5284	- Let us go. - Now?
5285	5287	Yes. Right now.
5304	5309	Darryl, come by the house tonight. About 9 p.m.
5310	5313	Lisa will be home by then.
5313	5316	Don't worry about it, we'll work something out.
5317	5319	Okay, see you later.
5325	5329	There's some people here to see you.
5331	5334	- Are they from McDonald's? - I don't think so.
5341	5344	What can I do for you?
5347	5350	This is King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.
5350	5354	- He's searching for his son Akeem. - Your son?
5354	5358	- Yes, my son, the Prince. - Prince? Are you serious?
5359	5361	Prince Akeem is the sole heir to the throne of Zamunda.
5362	5365	I knew there was something special about that boy.
5365	5370	- Can you tell us where he might be? - He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.
5373	5376	I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria. When you see him, call me.
5376	5378	- I'll tell him you're here. - No.
5379	5383	Do not alert him to my presence. I shall deal with him myself.
5389	5394	- For your trouble. - Thank you, your Royalness.
5405	5406	A prince!
5429	5431	Wait! We cannot go in.
5432	5434	Why not?
5434	5437	Wait in the car. I will be right back.
5447	5449	- We must leave. - I don't care about the apartment.
5449	5452	It's not that. I feel like I'm rushing you.
5452	5454	No, you're not.
5455	5459	- It's better if we take our time. - But I want to.
5459	5462	It's better if I take you home.
5469	5473	Look who's here! Akeem, it's good to see you.
5474	5477	- It's good to see you, too. - Have a drink.
5477	5481	- I have to get going, Mr McDowell. - You have time for one drink.
5482	5483	Get out of here, dog.
5483	5486	We don't spend enough time talking.
5486	5488	Perhaps some other time, I have to get going.
5489	5492	Sit down, I'll be right back with that drink.
5510	5513	King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.
5515	5518	Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.
5518	5521	Both the kids are here, together.
5521	5527	2432 Derby Avenue, Jamaica Estates. Right.
5527	5531	King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?
5535	5538	- I really have to go, sir. - No. Have a seat right here.
5538	5541	Did you want ice in that?
5541	5543	Excuse me, I'll be right back.
5555	5558	- Who was that? - Jehovah's Witness.
5559	5561	Excuse me.
5567	5571	She doesn't like you anymore. Get that through your greasy head!
5571	5574	But you told me to come over.
5577	5579	Now, where were we?
5594	5597	I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!
5607	5610	I appreciate your hospitality, but I have to get going.
5610	5612	You can stay a little while longer.
5612	5616	I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres in the oven... son.
5617	5620	Let me go see if they're ready.
5623	5626	- Lisa, I must leave. - Is something wrong, Akeem?
5627	5630	I'll tell you when the time is right, but now I must go.
5630	5633	Tell your father goodbye for me.
5637	5639	- Where's Akeem? - He had to leave.
5639	5643	- He can't leave! - What is going on?
5643	5647	And why are you so nice to Akeem all of a sudden?
5647	5649	I like the boy.
5650	5653	- What are you up to? - What? Nothing.
5653	5655	A man's got a right to change his mind.
5656	5660	- Daddy... - You two make a beautiful couple.
5660	5664	- Daddy... - He's a real fine young man.
5664	5670	- Dad! - Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!
5670	5673	- What? - He's got his own money.
5673	5679	When I tell you he's got his own money, I mean the boy has got his own money.
5686	5690	A prince. He's a prince!
5692	5695	Lisa, you did it this time. You hit the jackpot!
5696	5699	Your goat herder makes Darryl look like a welfare case.
5713	5716	I will get out here.
5717	5720	That'll be nine bucks.
5742	5745	Good news, Akeem. We've been rescued.
5745	5750	- Where are my parents? - They've gone to the McDowell's.
5750	5753	- Come with me. - Where are we going?
5753	5755	Back to Queens.
5756	5760	Look who's here! Come in, come in.
5760	5763	Welcome to Casa de McDowell's. Come right in.
5773	5775	- Where is Akeem? - He just stepped out.
5776	5780	Probably went for a pizza. You know these youngsters.
5780	5784	This must be your lovely wife. How are you today?
5784	5786	Very well, thank you.
5786	5791	I don't know whether to shake your hand, kiss it or bow or what.
5791	5794	I feel like break dancing.
5794	5800	Come in, have a seat, take a load off. Your son ought to be back in a minute.
5800	5804	- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable. - It's very nice.
5804	5806	Put your feet up.
5814	5817	Here you go, King. Try one of these pigs in a blanket.
5817	5819	They're the frozen kind, but you'd never know it.
5819	5822	You told me my son was here.
5822	5827	My daughter Lisa might know where he went. They've gotten quite close.
5827	5830	Where is your daughter? I must speak to her at once.
5831	5833	Lisa? There's someone here to see you.
5840	5843	This is Akeem's father. The King!
5843	5845	Leave us.
5854	5858	- I understand you're seeing my son. - I was seeing him.
5858	5860	So you know about his wife in Zamunda?
5861	5863	- He's married? - No, but he will be soon.
5863	5867	We've already chosen his bride. So you see...
5867	5870	...he cannot be serious about you.
5870	5874	Akeem came to America to... sow his royal oats.
5876	5878	Excuse me, I need to be alone.
5878	5883	Are you comfortable, Miss... I'm not sure what to call you.
5883	5888	- My name is Cleo. - Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.
5888	5891	Aoleon. Aeolon...
5895	5900	Lisa, where are you going? I want you to meet the Queen.
5900	5906	- Are you all right, my dear? - I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.
5906	5909	What's the matter, baby?
5914	5916	What did you say to my daughter?
5917	5920	The truth. That Akeem could not be interested in her.
5920	5925	- How can you be so sure? - Our son can't consort with such a girl
5926	5928	Now, wait a minute!
5929	5931	Oha...
5934	5938	You have been inconvenienced, and I'm prepared to compensate you.
5938	5942	- Shall we say 1 million dollars? - No way.
5942	5945	- 2 million. - You can't buy my daughter off.
5946	5949	- Nonsense! - Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.
5949	5953	I will not. The man is beneath me, and so is his daughter.
5953	5956	I don't give a damn who you are. This is America, Jack.
5957	5962	You say one more word about Lisa, and I'll break my foot off in your ass.
5963	5967	- Pardon me? - What's everybody yelling about?
5967	5971	Their son, the Prince, loves your sister, but the King can't handle it.
5971	5975	No, he's not. The Prince is in love with me.
5980	5983	- Are you all right? - Yes, Mother. I'm fine.
5984	5987	Why are you hugging him? He's just the servant.
5988	5991	He's the Prince.
5993	5995	Who told you that?
6002	6006	- You mean Akeem's the Prince? - Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.
6006	6009	How come she always gets the good ones?
6012	6016	- Where is Lisa? - Your daddy ran her off.
6020	6023	- What did you tell her? - It is of no consequence.
6023	6027	- We shall return to Zamunda at once. - I will not leave without Lisa.
6028	6030	So you do care for her?
6032	6035	Mother, I love her.
6035	6038	Then go after her.
6043	6048	- Akeem! I forbid you. - Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.
6074	6076	Darryl, what happened?
6078	6083	- Lisa dumped me. - I know. You poor thing.
6085	6090	The first thing we have to do is get you out of these wet clothes.
6093	6095	Stop!
6095	6097	Lisa!
6097	6099	Lisa!
6104	6106	I will be fine by myself.
6157	6159	Lisa, please.
6160	6163	I did not mean to hurt you.
6163	6167	Well, at least I know who gave me these.
6168	6171	You can keep them, 'cause I don't want them...
6171	6174	...and I don't want you.
6191	6192	Just leave me alone!
6192	6196	Lisa, please. I love you.
6196	6198	What about the woman you are supposed to marry?
6198	6201	I don't love her. Why do you think I came here?
6202	6205	Your father told me - to sow your royal oats.
6205	6210	I came to America to find my bride. I came to Queens to find you.
6211	6215	So why did you lie to me? Why didn' you just tell me you were a prince?
6215	6218	I wanted you to love me for who I am.
6219	6223	- I'm not sure who are. - I'm the man you fell in love with.
6223	6226	Should it matter that I am a prince?
6228	6230	It shouldn', but I...
6230	6235	Say you never loved me, and I won't bother you again.
6243	6246	It just wouldn't work out, we're too different.
6246	6249	You're royalty, for God's sake.
6249	6251	Do you want me to renounce my throne? I will.
6251	6255	I renounce my throne. I am no longer the Prince of Zamunda.
6256	6258	I renounce my throne!
6262	6265	Does this make you happy?
6274	6277	I can't let you do that.
6278	6280	I do not care about my crown.
6281	6284	All I care about is you.
6284	6287	Marry me, Lisa.
6291	6297	- So, what do you think? - Go on, honey. Take a chance.
6310	6315	Look, I'm sorry. I can'. Goodbye, Akeem.
6322	6326	If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.
6403	6408	Look at it this way. At least we learned how to make French fries.
6434	6437	You're still not speaking to me.
6438	6441	- I only want our son to be happy. - And so do I.
6442	6445	Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands. The girl told him no.
6445	6449	After the way you treated her, who could blame her?
6449	6453	Even if she said yes, they still couldn' marry. It's against the tradition.
6453	6456	Well, it is a stupid tradition.
6457	6461	- Who am I to change it? - I thought you were the King.
6545	6550	Your Highness. We have not come to that part yet.
6558	6562	Your Highness. Your Highness!
6590	6592	Would you really have given this up for me?
6592	6596	Of course. If you like, we can give it all up now.
6599	6600	Nah!
6669	6672	Wait a minute, wait a minute! Stop right there.
6673	6675	Listen! Stop right there a minute.
6675	6678	A man goes in to a restaurant. Are you listening?
6678	6683	A man goes into a restaurant. He sits down and has a bowl of soup.
6683	6686	He says to the waiter, "Come, taste the soup".
6686	6689	The waiter says, "Is there something wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."
6689	6692	"Is the soup too hot?" "Will you taste the soup?"
6692	6695	"Is the soup too cold?" "Will you just taste the soup!"
6695	6699	"All right, I'll taste the soup. Where's the spoon?"
6706	6708	What do you know from funny, you bastard?
