62	65	Could you tell them, for example, what is icing?
65	69	Well, icing happen when the puck come down, bang, you know,
69	72	before the other guys, nobody there, you know.
72	76	My arm go comes out, then the game stop then start up.
77	79	I see. What is high-sticking?
79	84	High-sticking happen when the guy take the stick, you know, and he go like that.
84	87	You don't do that. Oh, no. Never, never.
87	89	- Why not? - Against the rules.
89	92	You stupid when you do that, some English pig with no brains...
92	95	Denis, what is slashing?
95	98	Slashing is like that, you know?
98	102	Mm-hm. And there's a penalty for that?
102	106	- Yeah. And for trip also, you know. - Oh?
106	108	Like that. And for hook like this.
108	111	- And for spear, you know, like that. - Mm-hm.
111	116	All bad. You do that, you go to the box, you know.
116	121	Two minutes by yourself, and you feel shame, you know.
121	123	- Mm-hm. - And then you get free.
125	128	The Chiefs are at home against Hyannisport at the War Memorial at eight.
128	130	Good seats are still available.

161	163	Gentlemen, ournational anthem.
206	208	Hey, Denis.
217	219	- How's it going, Nick? - I'm drunk.
219	221	- Nah! - I'm not bullshittin' ya.
221	224	Got stinkin' shitfaced on the bus. Louise left me,
224	229	and that son of a bitch over there keeps playin' me when he knows I'm shitfaced.
229	230	Jeez, I'm really sorry.
231	235	Anybody throws me against the boards, I'm gonna piss all over myself.
251	254	Take it down the other end, Ned!
267	271	I thought I'd get Jerry one of those "Great ldeas of the World" sets.
272	277	You can look up the ideas alphabetically, like arts, mechanics, philosophy.
277	282	Yeah. Johnny always says you can just screw so much and drink so much.
290	295	We got Charlestown trailing here three to nothing, with 10.48 left in the first period.
295	299	Whoops! Correction, folks. That's two to nothing.
299	301	We don't wanna make it any tougher for the Chiefs.
318	323	That's what you're paid for, Braden. Now try winning a game for a change!
329	332	Number ten, Ned Braden, with his 18th goal ofthe year,
332	336	assisted by numberseven, Dunlop, and number 14, Drouin.
336	340	Ned Braden is now the leading scorer in the Federal League. Time ofthe goal...
341	343	Tie it up out there, guys!
343	346	Come on, defence! Get the puck outta there!
352	354	Hit him, Billy, hit him.
360	363	With us in the press box is injured Chiefs defenceman, Dave Carlson.
364	367	Dave, is it tough sitting here watching your team lose like this?
367	370	- Definitely, Jim. - You injured your knee in a game.
371	373	- No. - No? I thought you had.
374	377	No, I have a cold. You know, the runny nose and the sore throat.
378	381	I went out in that storm there last week to start my car.
381	384	I didn't have my jacket on. I think it's settled in my kidneys.
384	386	We got action in the Presidents' goal.
389	391	Hit him with your purse, ya pussy.
391	395	Jesus, look at Brophy. He's plastered.
395	399	He told me so. If anybody boards him, he's gonna piss all over himself.
399	402	- Piss all over himself? Good one. - Faire pipi, eh?
402	404	No, no. I OK.
419	424	..these games, and I'll check my memory against the statistics as soon as I can.
424	426	Joe McGrath.
426	427	Oh, yes, miss.
434	437	Get off the ice, Nick. You're gonna kill yourself.
448	451	They're out on the ice right now, giving their all.
451	454	- Get it together! - They will be ready.
454	458	Ensemble number 32, entitled "Omar Sharif',
458	461	modelled by Chiefs defenceman, Billy Charlebois,
461	467	who hails from, if I can read the card here, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
467	471	- The padded shoulders give it a '40s look. - You look nice, son. Real spiffy.
471	474	Keep in mind that the perfect accessory for the man in your life
474	477	is a season ticket to the Chiefs' games.
478	481	- I look like some cocksuckin' faggot. - Have you seen Reg or Braden?
481	483	Joe, I don't care. Enough is enough.
483	488	Nowhere in my contract does it say I gotta make a fool outta myself. Am I right?
488	492	- Have you seen Dunlop or Braden? - I'm gonna flash 'em, Joe.
492	495	I'm gonna open this faggot robe and wiggle my dick.
495	497	- You will not. - Yes I am, Joe, and you know why?
497	501	I want you to have a heart attack and die so we never have to do this again.
501	504	- Fuckin' fashion show. - It's good publicity.
504	507	You fellas have not been drawin' 'em in the way you have in the past.
507	510	I'm gonna wiggle it at 'em, you cheap bastard.
510	512	Be prepared, because when I yank it out,
512	516	everybody in that audience except my wife is gonna be runnin' for the exits.
516	520	Ensemble number eight, as we watch Chiefs defenceman,
520	522	Johnny Upton, modelling number eight.
522	526	- Joe McGrath. Just checking on Dunlop...
534	537	We have two generations of pro hockey with us
537	539	for you folks to call in and question.
539	543	Player-coach Reg Dunlop, and right wing Ned Braden.
543	547	Reggie, you represent the old guard, one of the iron men of the Federal League.
547	550	You've been playing pro hockey now for how many years?
550	553	- Quite a few, Jim. - Is that right?
553	555	On the other side of the scale, Ned,
555	558	who's a college graduate and an American citizen.
558	562	- At Princeton you were all-Eastern? - That's what it said in the yearbook.
562	565	OK. Our lines are open.
565	568	Anything you wanna know about the fascinating world of pro hockey...
568	572	Here we go. Hi there. Jim Carr. What's your question?
572	576	Hey, Dunlop, you old fart. Why don't you get outta the game and let some...
576	579	We're gonna spin some music while we wait for our next caller.
579	583	Before you do that, I know a lot of kids would enjoy coming to the games
583	585	to see a great veteran like Reggie skate.
585	589	While we wait for our next caller, we'd like to remind you folks calling in
589	592	to keep your questions within the boundaries of good taste.
594	598	What kind of broad is it that calls up and says something like that?
599	602	- They're supposed to be our fans. - Who cares? It's over.
602	604	Idiot McGrath and his shitty PR schemes.
604	606	I hate that cheap little bastard.
608	611	What are these poor fuckers gonna do when they close the mill?
611	614	They ain't closing it, just jacking the guys around
614	617	so they'll feel happy they got jobs.
617	620	- It's the old tactic, the mindfuck. - Announced it today.
620	622	April 1, they shut it tight.
624	626	- Yeah? - Yeah.
626	630	- That's a big surprise. - 10,000 mill workers placed on waivers.
631	633	What the hell are they gonna do with them?
634	636	I don't know. Every sucker for himself, I guess.
640	644	- Hey, who's she? - Um... it slipped my mind.
644	646	Oh, yeah? Maybe your wife'll remember.
652	656	You're the best girl in the whole world. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
656	660	Ruby. How's my Ruby? How's my girl, huh?
660	663	You're a sweetheart. I missed you. Yes, you're a sweetheart.
663	666	Are you my girl?
666	669	- Beginning to like it here, huh? - No. I hate it here.
670	673	I'm cracking up, you know what I mean?
673	677	- You don't look bad. - Can't figure it out. I'm slippin' fast.
678	681	- I think you look fine. - Slow down. You're making her nervous.
683	685	Jerry, I'd like to cancel the order.
685	688	- And there's another little matter... - Hello?
688	690	- Hey, Joe. - Would you hold it a minute?
690	692	What happens to us when the mill closes?
692	696	Don't worry about it. Here, the new boys are coming in on the 4.15 bus.
696	701	I wanna know what happens... Who are these guys? I never even heard of 'em.
701	705	- Son, just take 'em to the hotel. - I've done enough shitwork for today.
705	708	- The fuckin' fans call in with dirty talk. - Reg.
708	712	- Nothing in my contract says... - Reg! Do you see this quarter?
712	714	It used to be a nickel.
714	716	Now, the golden years are behind you.
716	719	One season, you'll be hanging up the blades and retiring the axe.
720	720	Fuck it.
720	725	Then you'll remember it was Joe McGrath who trained you for the front office.
726	730	I'm sorry, Jerry. Like I say, I'd like to cancel the order.
730	733	In fact, I've got some equipment I'd like to sell.
733	737	The skate sharpener, the massage table, the Jacuzzi, our bus...
745	750	Transways Express Flyernumber 83, forPittsburgh, Cleveland...
750	755	-..ready forboarding at gate two.
756	758	Please have your tickets available.
762	764	Hey! Hey!
767	769	- You the Hansons? - Fuckin' machine took my quarter.
769	772	Who are you?
772	774	Reggie Dunlop, the coach.
774	777	- Grab your gear and let's get goin'. - OK. Come on, Steve, let's go.
777	781	- It took my quarter. - Think they show Speed Racer here?
784	786	Hey, guys! Wait up.
788	790	Look what I got!
791	793	- You guys triplets? - No, I'm in the middle.
793	796	Steve's 20 and Jeffs 18.
796	799	- Where are you from? - Iron League.
799	801	- The lron League, huh? A lot of fights? - Nah.
802	804	Hey, I want a soda!
804	807	We paid for a week, then you gotta find a room of your own.
807	812	OK, Coach. Gimme a grape or an orange, and none of that stinkin' root beer!
813	817	- We go on the road tomorrow mor...
818	821	We're on the road in the morning.
821	825	- Bus leaves the War Memorial at 8am. - I gave you a quarter at the bus station.
825	828	Give me another dime. I'm savin' a dime to call Mom.
828	829	Jesus Christ.
835	839	You cheap son of a bitch. Are you crazy? Those guys are retards!
839	844	I got a good deal on those boys. The scout said they showed a lot of promise.
844	846	They brought their fuckin' toys with 'em!
847	850	I'd rather have 'em play with their toys than with themselves.
850	852	They're too dumb to play with themselves.
852	855	Every piece of garbage on the market, you gotta buy it!
855	858	Reg. Reg, that reminds me.
858	861	I was coachin' in Omaha in 1948
861	865	and Eddie Shore sends me this guy that's a terrible masturbator.
865	869	Couldn't control himself. He would get deliberate penalties
869	872	so he could get into the penalty box all by himself,
872	876	and damned if he wouldn't, you know...
876	879	- Oh, Joe. Jesus. - What was his name?
898	901	"To see the three Chiefs make a scoring rush,
901	906	the bright colours of their jerseys... flashing against the milky ice,
906	911	was to see a work of art in motion." That's good writin', Dickie.
911	913	- I tried to capture the spirit of it. - You did.
916	920	- Want a beer to go along with that? - It's ridiculous for us to be here.
920	923	We stick out like a couple of sore thumbs.
923	926	- I'm doin' what I like right here. - It's making you crazy too.
926	930	- You're turning into a zombie. - I don't wanna have a stinkin' fight again.
930	937	"Rookie goalie Denis Lemieux, continuing his brilliant first season with the Chiefs..."
937	939	Il parle de la game d'hier, ecoute ca.
939	942	OK. "Denis Lemieux continue sa saison..."
943	945	My father'd give you a job. Yours would.
945	948	I'm all for that. Always good to have choices.
949	952	I just wanna get out of this goddamn dump.
956	959	You take the van. I'll keep the dog.
964	966	Hey, Lily. Come on...
966	971	- What's the matter with her? - You're bullshit. You're really bullshit.
971	973	- You're drunk. - Yeah, he's bullshit.
973	976	Yeah? He and I are the only decent items in here.
976	981	That's great. Why should she give a shit what people think? She's just scrappin'.
981	983	My heart goes out to her.
983	985	You guys gotta stop losin'. Get the power play together.
986	988	Yeah, we're working on it.
992	995	- Is he nice to her? - Yeah! He love her.
996	998	He tell me. "I love her."
999	1001	Maybe Braden's a faggot. Did you think of that?
1001	1005	You crazy? He has a big cock! Like a horse!
1005	1008	Love is good, love can be strong
1008	1012	We gotta get right back to where we started from
1012	1017	All right, it's comin' on, we gotta get right back
1019	1021	Think that lady in the red dress'll go home with me?
1021	1024	- No. She's not your type. - How much?
1025	1027	Five dollars she don't even look at your face.
1035	1039	You got a cute way oftalkin'
1040	1042	You got the better ofme
1047	1050	- God, Francine, you look terrific. - You're right.
1050	1053	You've been had. That's his wife.
1054	1056	I'm in a spin, you know
1058	1061	So, how's your money holdin' out?
1061	1064	There's a beer in the fridge if you want one.
1064	1066	- Is that a new dress? - Sort of.
1067	1070	Looks good. Kinda tight.
1070	1072	I think I'm gaining a little weight.
1074	1077	- I don't know. Maybe it's better tight. - Maybe.
1082	1084	Is that the first time you wore that dress?
1086	1088	Been goin' out? Gettin' around?
1089	1092	You been seein' somebody in that dress?
1094	1096	Makin' out?
1098	1101	- That's none of your business any more. - Jesus, Francine.
1101	1105	I think about you all the time. Nothing is ever over.
1105	1108	If I wasn't so goddamn busy, I mean, I'd see more of you.
1109	1112	I was gonna come down the other night and ask you to the Aces,
1112	1114	but, I don't know, something came up.
1116	1119	What? You need dough?
1120	1124	- Save your money. You're gonna need it. - Who, me?
1124	1126	When they close the mill, the Chiefs'll fold.
1126	1129	- That's bullshit. - These people are gonna be broke.
1129	1133	They're not gonna be going to hockey games. You're not getting any younger.
1133	1137	- I got nothing to worry about. I coach. - You're no good at it.
1137	1140	Every player on that team thinks I'm the greatest.
1142	1145	- What? - You're a losing coach.
1146	1148	You can't make 'em win.
1150	1153	I was thinking about you the other day, tryin' to imagine you
1153	1156	when you're through with hockey, and I couldn't.
1156	1158	There was nobody there.
1159	1163	- What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna come back to you.
1165	1167	Too little, too late.
1172	1174	- Hey! Charlie!
1177	1179	Ned! Ned!
1183	1185	I underlined the fuck scenes for ya.
1186	1188	Get back in the van. You're gonna catch pneumonia.
1198	1202	Go back to the van, cos you're gorgeous and you're gonna catch pneumonia.
1211	1213	Go get her, Billy.
1218	1222	- Back in the o" iron lung. - She underlines the fuck scenes for ya?
1224	1227	Jeez, she must worship the ground you walk on.
1227	1230	They teach you how to underline in college.
1230	1232	Not the fuck scenes, they don't.
1233	1236	Braden, you gotta learn to put out more, you know what I mean?
1244	1248	Holy Mother of God. Ned. Ned, are you seein' what I'm seein'?
1249	1251	Hey, Billy.
1254	1255	Jesus!
1255	1258	It's finally happened.
1258	1261	- Hi, guys. How you doin'? - Hello.
1261	1264	- Hey, fellas. - They're fuckin' horrible-lookin'.
1264	1266	Don't look at me. It's McGrath's doing.
1266	1269	What did he trade for these assholes? A used puck bag?
1269	1272	I think it's a fuckin' disgrace.
1272	1275	- Watch Braden. He's gonna do somethin'. - Hi.
1276	1279	- Are you guys brothers? - Are you guys brothers!
1281	1283	- What a life. - OK, bets on the trip, men.
1283	1286	Walt has entrusted me with our ETA in Lancaster, $5 limit.
1286	1289	OK. I'm ready to take estimates from the membership.
1289	1292	Walt is the leading contender
1292	1295	for the outdoor record, Charlestown-Lancaster.
1295	1298	All aboard, son. Let's go, Walt.
1299	1300	Where are the new boys?
1301	1304	Oh, son. There are your brothers.
1304	1308	- Why is the fuckin' old man on this trip? - I don't know.
1317	1319	I'm expecting great things from you.
1319	1324	Walt, you didn't tell me you were holding out on your old bookmaker.
1324	1327	Ooh, and it's all right, and it's comin' on
1327	1331	We gotta get right back to where we started from
1331	1333	Love is good...
1333	1336	- Who opened? - On the stick. Let's go, Denis.
1336	1338	Two dollars.
1338	1341	Two bucks. I'll call.
1341	1344	- Fold. - Let's see.
1344	1346	Two and sixes.
1346	1348	- Hey, that's nice. - I'm out.
1349	1351	- Kings over. - Fuck.
1351	1355	- I lose my blouse. - Shirt. Your shirt.
1355	1356	Shit.
1356	1360	Denis, mon ami, if you sign your contract over to me, I'll prorate your losses.
1360	1362	Jesus, Braden. You would, wouldn't you?
1362	1366	My ambition is to win all your contracts, own this club and run it my way.
1366	1368	- I'd make a fortune. - Yeah.
1368	1371	Compulsory fashion shows every afternoon.
1371	1374	- Radiothons twice a week. - Recycled jockstraps.
1374	1377	- Who owns the club, anyway? - I don't know.
1377	1379	You don't know?
1379	1382	What do you mean? A corporation owns it.
1382	1386	- Who cares? You get your cheques. - That's the spirit, Reg. That's it.
1386	1389	Hey, pot's light. Come on. Who's in?
1390	1391	What's the game?
1391	1393	Same game. Jacks or better, progressive.

1432	1436	- We're in trouble. - What? Oh, shit, he's here.
1436	1438	- Who? - Ogilthorpe.
1438	1440	- Ogie Ogilthorpe? - You know Ogilthorpe?
1440	1442	- Ogil-terp? - Ogilthorpe.
1442	1445	For the sake of the game, they oughta throw him in San Quentin.
1445	1448	- He is a criminal element! - The worst goon in hockey today.
1448	1452	- Oh, yeah. Real cement-head. - Big Afro. 21, 22. Watch out for him.
1452	1455	He's not playing. He's suspended.
1456	1460	That's Ogie! 15 minutes. Let's go, now.
1461	1466	Big crowd out there tonight. Let's really try to win this one, eh, boys?
1467	1470	Gotta hand it to the old bastard, he's original.
1470	1473	That man travelled 15 hours by bus to say that?
1476	1478	Hey.
1485	1488	- What are you guys doin'? - Puttin' on the foil.
1488	1491	- Every game. - Yeah, you want some?
1491	1493	No.
1499	1502	Jesus fuckin' Christ. They don't leave the bench.
1503	1505	Charlie, ska...
1509	1514	Come on, now. The Chiefs are a terrific organisation. But, well, the mill is closing,
1514	1518	and I think next year I'd be interested in a good front-office job.
1518	1523	Al, that's why I made the trip. I wanted to talk to you fellas face to face.
1523	1526	Excuse me just a minute, Al. Son.
1527	1532	Push thatpelvis way up there.
1533	1537	Way, way up there. Raise your tummy up to...
1537	1542	Let's play it smart out there tonight. I wanna see a lot of work from you guys.
1542	1545	Use your heads on the ice out there, will ya?
1545	1548	We all know how to play hockey. Just play it smart.
1548	1551	- Get out there and stick 'em! - Fuck 'em!
1551	1553	- Let's go! - Come on!
1553	1556	- Come on! - Let's go, now.
1556	1559	- We need this win. We've a lot of losses... - Yeah!
1563	1566	That's what we're here for, guys. To win.
1566	1571	Play heads-up out there. Let's be smart. We're better than any club if we try.
1576	1578	Come on, Braden. Our line starts.
1584	1585	It's fucking embarrassing.
1611	1615	- Come on, guys. We can get it back! - What for? We're history.
1615	1619	- What are you talkin' about? - McGrath's tryin' to get himself a job.
1619	1622	- Fuckin' team's folding. - I knew there was a reason he came.
1622	1625	- Nobody told me anything. - He wasn't gonna tell you.
1625	1628	The fucker was holdin' on till he could scrounge a job.
1628	1630	- Jesus Christ. - Cover his wrinkled old ass.
1630	1633	Fuckin' Chrysler plant, here I come.
1633	1636	- The team, fini. Kaput. - Fini?
1649	1653	This is the last season. It'll be announced tomorrow.
1665	1669	I'm too old to be traded in. A one-in-a-million chance.
1669	1673	I'm gonna be calling my brother tomorrow at the fuckin' Chrysler plant.
1673	1676	Operator? Operator?
1676	1679	Ah! Bernard. Yeah. They close it.
1679	1683	Yeah. Yeah, I want to echanger.
1683	1686	Bernard, call Detroit, tell them bullshit.
1687	1689	Yeah. Yeah, something.
1690	1692	Wait. Ned, what's echanger in English?
1692	1694	Trade me right fucking now.
1694	1696	Trade me right fucking now!
1696	1698	Now hang up.
1701	1703	Hello?
1703	1706	- Wait a minute. Reg! - Yeah.
1711	1714	Yeah. Hey!
1714	1719	If I had to do it again, I would've gotten an education. You know what I mean?
1719	1724	Jesus Christ, look at Ned here. He doesn't have to depend on hockey.
1724	1726	What are you doin' here?
1728	1730	Oh. Where's Hanrahan?
1731	1734	I know a good bar here. The Palm lsle.
1735	1737	Fucked the barmaid last trip.
1738	1740	I mean, I walked into the place,
1740	1744	she comes up to me without even sayin' hello and just rubs up against me.
1745	1747	Ah, come on, Mo. Jesus. What?
1747	1752	I mean, she had her jugs right up against my suit.
1752	1755	- Nipples as hard as little rocks. - Right, Morris.
1756	1758	Yeah. What's the address?
1758	1761	Any of you guys know the Palm lsle in this town?
1761	1762	Yeah. Don't move.
1762	1765	Before Larry has his one chance at ourJackpot Bowl,
1766	1769	is there anyone you would like to say hello to back home?
1769	1772	- Ten bucks he says the guys at work. - Ten bucks, wife and kids.
1772	1776	- I'm with Braden. -..the camera and say hello to anybody.
1776	1778	I'd like to say hi to all the guys down at work.
1779	1780	- All right! - Ha!
1790	1793	Put my fucking car back on the track, will ya?
1793	1794	One more lap.
1794	1796	- Hi, Coach. - Hi, Coach.
1796	1798	How are ya?
1801	1804	- Two-nothing. Two-nothing. - Come on.
1804	1806	- Brought your cars, huh? - We're on the road.
1807	1810	- We're all set to go. - Tell us when.
1810	1815	Oh. I'm shufflin' lines around, guys. I'll let you know when I get it straightened out.
1815	1817	- OK, Coach. - See you later, Coach.
1817	1820	Five-nothing. Five-nothing.
1820	1824	- I'm beating you guys. - The thing's not workin'. I quit.
1824	1826	I don't wanna play no more. You broke the darn car.
1826	1829	- How am I supposed to play? - You big baby.
1835	1839	You are the first man I've slept with since I left Hanrahan.
1840	1843	Oh, Suzanne. A beautiful woman like you?
1846	1848	I've been sleeping with women.
1853	1855	Are you shocked?
1855	1858	No.
1858	1860	Did you ever wanna sleep with a man?
1860	1862	- No. - Never?
1864	1866	No.
1868	1872	I don't blame you, though, Suzanne. You see, women's bodies are beautiful.
1872	1877	But men's bodies, I see 'em everywhere. Locker rooms, cocks all over the place...
1877	1880	- Do you wanna know how it happened? - No, that's OK.
1881	1884	No, that's all right. Cos I have to tell it in court anyway.
1884	1888	See, every time Hanrahan went out on the road,
1888	1892	I would go over to this wife's house, and we would get drunk,
1892	1897	and we would talk about how depressed and lonely we were without the guys.
1898	1901	Every week, blah, blah, blah.
1901	1906	Then, one night, we were talking about how we hated the life,
1906	1909	and how we had never done much of anything ourselves.
1910	1913	And I don't know why, really...
1913	1917	We were like kids. We started playing with one another.
1918	1920	We were drunk, as usual.
1922	1927	The next week we did it sober, and it was terrific.
1933	1937	At the end of the day, I think about women. I think about women's bodies.
1937	1941	Maybe it'll change, and I'll wind up sleeping with old goalies.
1941	1943	Things being what they are, who knows?
1943	1947	When Hanrahan found out about it, he went crazy.
1947	1950	He said if I was a dyke, that made him a queer.
1951	1954	He started slapping me around. I ended up in the hospital.
1954	1958	- Oh, Jesus. - Yeah. I'm on the lam. I'm hiding out.
1959	1961	We play him next week, you know.
1961	1965	Oh, God. I'm so sick of those games. They seem so childish.
1968	1970	The Chiefs are folding.
1971	1975	The mil"s closing, and the economy and stuff.
1975	1977	I just found out about it tonight.
1978	1980	I don't know what I'm gonna do.
1980	1983	Christ. A handsome man like you, Reggie?
1985	1990	It ain't easy. I don't see myself in one of those bullshit nine-to-five jobs.
1991	1994	- Well, you could get traded. - Suzanne, I ain't a rookie any more.
1994	1998	So far as the coaching goes, you know, the Chiefs are...
2000	2004	Hey. Use your imagination. It's what I've been doing.
2004	2009	Oh, look at me! Here I am, a no-good runaway hockey wife.
2011	2013	A dyke.
2027	2030	Turn it off! I hate it! I hate it, I hate it!
2031	2034	- I don't wanna watch it! - Don't touch that television!
2034	2036	Sorry about the Chiefs, Reg.
2036	2041	I'm doing a tribute to the team on Sunday. "Chiefs Fold: A Sad Commentary."
2041	2043	- Something along those lines. - Dickie.
2044	2048	Something's afloat. This is on the QT, but I think they're gonna sell us.
2048	2051	I can't name names, but let's just say
2051	2055	that there's a senior citizen's community in a southern state
2055	2057	that's in the market for a hockey team.
2057	2060	- The Chiefs? - Actually, it's Florida.
2061	2064	See, they're gettin' a bunch of old geezers down there from the northeast.
2064	2069	And what do you think those old geezers really miss in Florida?
2069	2072	I think there are a lot of shysters in Florida.
2072	2075	Hockey. Their own team. A Saturday-night game.
2075	2079	Those poor old people down there, they gotta have something to root for.
2080	2082	- You're a pussy.
2082	2086	Daddy, he called me a pussy and then he changed the station.
2086	2089	Don't bother your daddy now. Work it out amongst yourselves.
2089	2091	Baby, baby, baby!
2091	2097	Now, let me get this straight. A retirement community has bought the Chiefs?
2097	2101	- Oh, no. I said negotiating. - Well, that's not much to go on, Reggie!
2101	2104	Dickie, Dickie, they've already built the rink!
2104	2106	They've dumped a lot of capital into this.
2106	2110	What they're really lookin' for is a cheap deal on a team.
2111	2115	And since we ain't exactly the Boston Bruins...
2115	2120	How could anybody in his right mind buy a fifth-place team?
2120	2123	That situation is gonna be changed, I guarantee you.
2125	2126	Watch your wing!
2126	2128	Hey, Hanrahan!
2128	2130	Hanrahan!
2131	2134	Cover the point, goddamnit!
2134	2136	Come on, Mo! Give it to him.
2140	2143	It's along the boards! Nail him, nail him!
2148	2151	Hanrahan! Suzanne sucks pussy!
2159	2161	Get him outta there!
2161	2163	Watch it behind the net!
2163	2167	Hey, Hanrahan! She's a dyke! I know! I know!
2170	2172	Come on! Pick it up, take it out!
2177	2179	She's a lesbian! A lesbian!
2179	2182	- A lesbian! - Son of a bitch!
2215	2217	You're nuts, Hanrahan!
2217	2220	He wouldn't dare pull anything like that on Johnny.
2233	2236	That's it. That's all.
2236	2240	- Hold it. That's all. - What the fuck you talkin' about?
2240	2242	- You're out. - Son of a bitch!
2242	2244	Jesus Christ!
2254	2257	Good job, guys. That's the way. Two points, that's it.
2264	2267	My allergy to those fucking fans, you know, has returned.
2267	2269	That ends the longest losing streak ever.
2269	2272	- What did he say to Hanrahan? - Two points, eh?
2278	2281	Hey, Reg! Reg! What did you say to him?
2284	2287	- I told him his wife was a dyke. - No!
2287	2289	- Yeah! - Fuck!
2289	2292	Jesus Christ. No wonder he flipped his lid.
2292	2295	Anybody called my old lady a dyke, I'd go fuckin' bananas.
2295	2297	His wife is a dyke.
2297	2301	- Jesus Christ. Poor fuckin' guy. - Does that make him a fag?
2301	2305	Fuck him. Hanrahan's an ape. I knew it would piss the shit out of him.
2305	2308	She's a fantastic gal. I mean, fantastic!
2308	2310	I knew it'd drive him berserk.
2311	2313	You nailed him, Coach, in the fucking head.
2313	2315	- Right in his mind. - He deserved it!
2316	2317	Yeah! Yeah!
2318	2323	That was wrestling shit. They didn't have a backup goalie. It was a garbage goal.
2323	2325	No, no. You gotta twist them and fuck with them.
2325	2327	It was a garbage win.
2338	2341	Hey! Hey, Lily!
2341	2343	Lil! Where you goin'?
2358	2360	Hey, Lily!
2363	2365	Hey, Lily.
2367	2369	Hey!
2371	2373	Lil!
2375	2379	Jesus, Lily, there've been three rapes and two murders in this park in one year.
2380	2383	- I didn't do it. - We're gonna freeze to death.
2383	2387	If you leave, you won't have that problem, will ya?
2409	2412	- What's the story on that dog? - What?
2413	2415	What's the story on that dog?
2416	2420	That's the dog that saved Charlestown from the 1938 flood.
2420	2422	Well, fuck him.
2424	2427	He's just gonna shock her with his views on life.
2429	2432	You know, if you were to come up to my apartment,
2432	2435	I'd fix you a hot drink, rub your back, and we could find a good game on TV.
2436	2436	Great.
2437	2441	I'd even fix you something to eat, tell you some stories, and...
2441	2445	Well, by the time pneumonia set in, you'd be sound asleep.
2447	2449	Well, see you around.
2452	2458	You know, he's... he's been so kind to me. He comes in every day.
2458	2461	He really doesn't wanna rush yourprogress right now.
2462	2465	I think I'll invite him out to the summerhouse tonight,
2465	2468	so that we can talk about you more.
2468	2471	I wish I could put my arms around you.
2471	2474	When you get out ofthisjacket, you can.
2476	2478	- Hi, guys. - Hi, Coach.
2479	2480	Reg.
2480	2483	I sold your car.
2483	2486	- My 260Z? - Yes.
2490	2492	But that was my car.
2492	2494	Alex, don't you remember?.
2494	2499	When you had the amnesia, you gave me power ofattorney.
2499	2500	I'd forgotten.
2500	2503	- That cunt is no good. - Nice talk.
2504	2506	I've boxed up everything.
2506	2509	She do that to make him crazy so he don't know what he doing.
2509	2511	Cynthia Pierce is having an affair with Carl Barton.
2511	2515	- She's lyin' to him. - Oh, Alex. Alex.
2515	2517	You mustn't be weak.
2520	2524	I don't believe this. I don't friggin' believe this! Hey, you guys, listen.
2524	2527	"Chiefs Sought By Florida Retirement Community."
2527	2530	- Oh, come on, Dave. - No, Johnny, it's right here.
2530	2533	Hey, JG, Jimmy, come over here. Listen to this.
2533	2536	"Unidentified but reliable sources have informed the Times Herald
2536	2541	that a St Petersburg, Florida retirement community is negotiating
2541	2544	with the Charlestown Hockey Corporation for the purchase of the Chiefs."
2544	2548	It's right there, Reg. Look at that. Yeah!
2548	2552	Dickie Dunn wrote this. It's gotta be true. Fantastic!
2553	2556	- Florida. - What sucker would buy the Chiefs?
2556	2557	Jealous there, big guy?
2557	2560	Your mother shoulda bought you skates!
2560	2566	Cut off my balls, I'll be skating in Florida
2566	2569	- We're gonna miss you. - Here's to the sap that'd buy the Chiefs.
2569	2572	Hell, here's to the Sunshine State!
2572	2576	Here's to all that gorgeous snatch in FLA.
2577	2578	Yeah!
2600	2603	- What's wrong, Reg? - Huh? Oh, nothing.
2603	2606	You got an expression of sadness on your face.
2606	2610	- I guess this is my last season. - No, it's not. We're being bought.
2610	2614	At my age, you gotta think about retiring. I know all the other teams laugh at me.
2614	2618	- That's not true. - They do. I hear 'em, every game.
2618	2622	They're just saying that to get you upset. It doesn't mean anything.
2623	2626	Thanks, kid. Maybe you're right.
2642	2644	Drouin, open your fucking eyes!
2649	2651	Tough news, Barclay. Sorry.
2651	2653	What fuckin' news?
2654	2658	Minnesota dropped you. Yeah, it's in Hockey News. I'll save it for you.
2658	2660	I got a contract!
2660	2663	Come on, let's go, let's go! Come on! Let's go!
2663	2667	Know what your problem is, Dunlop? You're too fuckin' old to play this game.
2667	2670	Take that sentence back!
2685	2687	Too much, too soon.
2703	2705	Dave, hold it steady. You're makin' me miss.
2706	2708	You got him, Dave!
2708	2712	Did you hear what he said? He shouldn't have said what he said.
2712	2715	You don't say stuff like that on the ice.
2715	2718	- Let's just win the game. - We are winnin' the friggin' game!
2718	2720	You goon!
2721	2724	You wanna say some more, you ugly bastard?
2730	2734	Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, get him!
2737	2740	We were all there. We all saw it with our own eyes.
2741	2743	Dave.
2743	2747	Goddamn lardass, Barclay Donaldson. I'm tellin' you, he jumped us.
2748	2751	Gloves off, stick down, no warning. He challenged the Chiefs!
2751	2753	- He called us names. - Called us names!
2755	2758	- But Dave was there. - Dave's a killer!
2758	2761	- Dave's a killer. - Dave's a mess.
2762	2764	OK, but Dave's out.
2767	2770	- Who's gonna take his place? - Is the answer Jesus?
2774	2776	OK, guys. Show us what you got.
2826	2828	God save us.
2830	2833	Kill 'em! Kill the bastards!
2838	2841	I do not believe my friggin' eyes.
2850	2853	These guys are a fucking disgrace.
2861	2866	And I'm telling you, Broom County is just visibly upset by this display.
2866	2868	Get places for the home games. Bring the kids.
2868	2871	We got entertainment for the whole family.
2888	2891	There goes Jeff Hanson into the corner. No, it's Jack.
2891	2895	17. I'll have to check that later. A crushing check on the boards!
2895	2897	Things are really going on out there now!
2897	2902	Now Steve is in front of the net. I think that's Steve. Yes. No. Yeah, it is Steve.
2917	2919	And I think that was Jack. It was Jeff or Jack.
2919	2922	These brothers are stomping all over...
2924	2927	- You! Out! - What?
2927	2930	- You! Out! - Huh? What for?
2930	2933	- You! Out! - No! No!
2936	2939	- Get your eyes examined, you idiot! - What are you doin'?
2939	2942	- They're all gone! - It was self-defence, for Christ's sake!
2942	2945	- They're gone! - How much do you expect a man to take?
2945	2948	- Don't come near me. - Are you runnin' a goddamn dance?
2970	2972	- Open it.
2980	2984	- Joe, who own the Chiefs? - Owns. Owns.
2984	2986	Owns. Owns.
2986	2988	I don't know.
2989	2991	Thanks.
3003	3005	- OK. What? - He don't know.
3007	3009	- How'd you ask? - I say "Who own the Chiefs?"
3009	3012	- What did he say? - Owns. Owns.
3012	3013	For Christ's sake.
3013	3016	I don't care who own the Chiefs. I hate it here.
3016	3021	It make me sick. My allergy, puke every time, bleugh! Like that, puke.
3021	3024	You're a goalie. You're supposed to be like that.
3024	3026	Somebody own the Chiefs.
3026	3028	We go to Florida and I get the money.
3042	3045	That's nice.
3048	3052	I don't like the way they cover their jugs all up with the feathers, you know, Reg?
3052	3054	They are so beautiful.
3058	3063	They oughta cut the costumes up higher on the thigh, so you can see more ass.
3063	3066	You make me sick when you speak, Morris.
3066	3069	This isn't art. This is sex.
3080	3082	Ooh!
3082	3084	Ogilthorpe fucked her, you know.
3085	3087	It's true. I heard it from a couple of guys.
3088	3091	Ogilthorpe fucked the last girl on the pinwheel of the lce Stravaganza.
3092	3094	That's her, right there.
3103	3106	Get your butt in gear, for the love of Mike.
3137	3140	- You gals like skatin', huh? - Sure.
3140	3145	I mean, dressed as bluebirds with all them feathers on, racin' around the ice like that.
3145	3149	- You should talk. - No, well, I just asked out of curiosity.
3149	3153	- I like to see how the other half lives. - Renee, I like to skate too.
3153	3155	- But the hair is rotten here. - Hair?
3155	3157	Yeah. The hair.
3158	3160	- Air. - It make me sick.
3160	3163	- Your face is a mess. - I got in a fight. See?
3164	3166	I don't know. It looks sorta cute.
3166	3169	- Are you a fighter? - Nah. I'm a lover.
3179	3182	Is your team any good?
3182	3185	No. In fact, we're so bad that we're disbanding.
3186	3188	What about Florida, eh, Reg?
3188	3191	- Well, we got a win. - We won three games in a row, Reg.
3191	3194	- Yeah. We're on a roll. - We're on a roll. We're gonna win.
3194	3197	- How's Ogie Ogilthorpe?
3197	3200	- Who? - Ogie Ogilthorpe. You know old Ogie.
3200	3203	- Ogie. - You think he's all he's cracked up to be?
3203	3205	Is he a nice guy?
3206	3208	I'll be right back.
3212	3216	- You're doing great. You've got 'em... - Oh, yeah. You betcha.
3218	3219	Hey, Coach!
3220	3222	How you doin'?
3230	3232	Son of a bitch.
3240	3243	Ooh, and it's all right, and it's comin' on...
3243	3245	Hey, where the hell did all this beer come from?
3245	3247	- It's from the owner. - The owner?
3248	3249	Yeah.
3249	3251	How's his family, Reg?
3251	3253	He told me to say he's glad we're winnin',
3253	3256	cos it'll make it easier to close that Florida deal.
3256	3258	- You find the guy name? - Oh, yeah.
3258	3263	- He's neat. Looking to get us bonuses. - Hey, that's good news, eh?
3263	3265	- Yeah.
3266	3268	- What? What? - Beats me.
3268	3271	No one can take yourplace
3274	3276	lfyou get hurt
3279	3282	- What the fuck is that?
3283	3285	Hey!
3285	3286	Where? Oh, yeah!
3294	3298	- We thought it'd be a big surprise. - It's wonderful!
3301	3304	You look like my mother! You're beautiful!
3306	3308	Yeah! Billy!
3312	3315	Hey. It's me, Reg. How are you?
3317	3320	We're kickin' the shit outta everybody. We're unbeatable.
3320	3322	Listen, I got a favour to ask ya.
3322	3325	Yeah. Remember Francine?
3326	3329	All together in one room. Why not?
3330	3335	My ex-wife. Yeah, the pretty one. Well, has she been in there?
3336	3340	- We're in the Chiefs! - It's against our policy.
3340	3342	Couple of tickets in it for you. Which bar?
3344	3349	Wait a minute. Hold it. No, it's just everybody's going bananas in here.
3352	3355	- They convicted Ogilthorpe. - Help me.
3355	3358	Get the manager. Somebody help me.
3358	3361	Eddie? Listen, this guy she was with - what did he look like?
3361	3365	It's their rink, it's their ice and it's their fuckin' town.
3365	3367	- But tonight we got our fans with us! - Yeah!
3367	3371	They spent their own dough to get here, and they came here to see us.
3371	3376	Let's show 'em what we got. Get out on the ice and let 'em know you're there.
3376	3379	Get that stick in their side, let 'em know you're there.
3379	3382	Get that lumber in his teeth, let him know you're there!
3382	3384	Bleed all over 'em. Let 'em know you're there.
3384	3386	Give 'em a good warm-up, Danny. Let's go.
3386	3388	Come on, fellas.
3388	3390	Good game tonight, guys.
3394	3398	The Peterborough Patriots versus the Charlestown Chiefs,
3398	3401	brought to you by Sheehan's Rustproofing.
3401	3404	The Chiefs have come out on the ice for a warm-up period.
3404	3407	They're about to try for their fifth consecutive win.
3407	3409	They're applauded by their booster club,
3409	3413	who have travelled all the way from Charlestown to be here tonight.
3447	3450	There's no one to stop it because there are no officials on the ice.
3450	3454	What has come over the Charlestown Chiefs?
3461	3466	And the rockets' red glare
3466	3470	The bombs bursting in air
3470	3475	Gave proof through the night
3475	3480	That our flag was still there
3481	3483	I got my eye on you. You pull one thing, you're out.
3483	3486	I run a clean game. Any trouble, I'll suspend you.
3486	3488	I'm listening to the fucking song!
3493	3499	O'er the land of the free
3499	3504	No. No, no. To Mrs Reggie Dunlop, from Reggie Dunlop.
3505	3506	Collect.
3508	3512	Well, make it... Operator, I'll pay for the call here.
3514	3516	Whoa!
3517	3519	- What are you doin'? - Makin' it look mean.
3519	3520	Yeah!
3525	3530	Honey? We won last night. Yeah, we won. I got a good winning streak going...
3530	3533	- Who is this?
3533	3535	Hello?
3536	3538	Shit!
3548	3552	A little bit south ofSaskatoon
3554	3557	Me and Junie Mae, we got on fine
3557	3560	Till I had to move
3560	3562	Gin.
3564	3566	Eight.
3569	3571	- Hey, Reg? - Yeah?
3573	3575	- I think I'm gonna change my name. - Oh, yeah?
3575	3577	Yeah.
3578	3581	Killer.
3581	3584	Hey, that's got a nice ring to it, kid.
3584	3585	Yeah.
3595	3597	I'm not gonna do it.
3598	3600	- I'm not gonna goon it up for you. - No?
3602	3605	Nope.
3606	3608	I'll bench you.
3609	3611	I'll take my chances.
3612	3615	Keep on thinkin' ofmy honeymoon
3616	3621	A little bit south ofSaskatoon
3624	3627	Pick up the boosters!
3627	3629	Pull over, Walt!
3629	3631	Let's get the girls in here.
3632	3634	Come on, Walt!
3635	3636	Great.
3659	3662	My husband will kill me when he finds out.
3662	3663	Let's go.
3665	3668	Their bus is coming up the street! They're coming!
3671	3673	We don't need you here!
3673	3676	There's no room in sports for people like you.
3677	3679	Get outta town!
3683	3686	Keep thinkin' ofmy honeymoon
3686	3691	A little bit south ofSaskatoon
3692	3696	By a big old fire and honeymoon
3696	3698	A little bit south
3699	3701	7-1. There's the face-off.
3702	3707	Charlestown Chiefs seem to be coming down the ice with the puck.
3709	3712	Kill those Hanson creeps!
3719	3721	You goons! You can't skate!
3722	3725	We like to see an old-fashioned brand of hockey played here.
3725	3727	You're a bunch of animals, you Hanson apes!
3741	3744	Get outta town, four-eyes!
3762	3765	- Is this the guy? - Yeah, that's him!
3765	3767	No, he's over there!
3772	3776	Ladies and gentlemen, look at that. You can't see that. I'm on radio.
3778	3780	No, no, not him. That's the one!
3781	3784	Go fuck a moose, froggy!
3784	3786	Think we should get into this?
3787	3789	Just a thought.
3789	3793	- It wasn't me! - No, Jeff, no. It's the other guy.
3798	3801	Think the old folks in Florida are gonna like these guys?
3801	3804	I don't believe a word of that Florida shit.
3804	3808	The fans are standing up to them. The security guards are standing up to them.
3808	3811	The peanut vendors are standing up to them!
3811	3814	If I could get down there, I'd be standing up to them!
3825	3828	- What hit you? - An object, right in the face.
3828	3831	- I know. What was it? - I don't know. Key chain, you know.
3831	3834	- Car keys, house keys. - Keys to the camper.
3842	3845	- Hi, guys. - The Hansons.
3847	3851	Guys? Put the fucking bus in gear. The cops have come for the Hansons.
3851	3853	- The cops? - How many are out there?
3858	3860	The Hansons.
3863	3867	I throw up my hands. I can't control 'em any more. They gotta be punished.
3867	3870	Will you do me a favour and put 'em behind bars?
3873	3878	They're looking for you guys. There's gotta be some misunderstanding.
3883	3887	Look at his lip. Somebody threw a fucking tyre chain, hit him right in the mouth.
3887	3890	Scratches, made by human fingernails.
3890	3892	This kid has taken a savage beating.
3894	3897	There's six of them out there for us.
3897	3901	They're gonna put you in the same jail with Ogilthorpe. Come on, you guys.
3902	3905	They let you make one phone call.
3905	3908	They book you, then they give you a dime and let you make one phone call.
3908	3913	- Call the pizza man! - Why don't you call a massage parlour?
3914	3917	- Hey, guys, we'll see you later. - Save me a piece of pizza.
3917	3922	- Don't eat my watermelon sticks. - Don't admit to nothing, you guys.
3924	3928	It's me - Reg. They're puttin' the Hansons away on a trumped-up charge.
3929	3932	Someone threw a monkey wrench. Yeah, it hit Jeff right in the face.
3933	3937	No, they were defending the honour of Charlestown at the time.
3938	3940	The boosters are behind us 100 per cent.
3942	3944	Dickie? Have you seen Francine?
3944	3948	Sergeant, you will never meet a greater champion of pure hockey than me.
3949	3951	Sergeant, I knew Eddie Shore!
3951	3953	- You guys back there? - Hey, Coach!
3953	3956	Peterborough lost tonight, so as of now we're in the play-offs!
3957	3962	Sergeant, I would like to see the bail just a little more reasonable...
3962	3966	- Joe, hurry it up. Let's get outta here. - Sergeant, when is the trial?
3966	3968	You can't keep them here. They're folk heroes.
3968	3971	- They're criminals. - Most folk heroes start as criminals.
3972	3974	Sergeant, you're asking an exorbitant sum.
3974	3978	Joe, I got it right here. How much are these goons gonna cost us?
3978	3981	- Hey, guys! Braden's bailin' you out! - $250 each.
3981	3986	This young fella is in a hurry because he's got the prettiest wife you ever saw waitin'.
3986	3989	- But she ain't happy. - Sam, let 'em out.
3990	3991	I want a receipt.
3991	3993	Hey, hey, hey!
3993	3996	Hey, Coach, look, we got to keep our bracelets.
3996	3998	Thanks a lot, Sarge.
3999	4002	- Let's get on the bus. - Look at that.
4003	4007	The boys and I want you to have this as a little memento.
4007	4010	It's a Chiefs key ring. You can't buy these in stores.
4033	4036	- Aren't those Hansons something? - Aren't they, though?
4036	4040	- They're sorta funny-looking. - Real funny-looking.
4040	4043	- They're probably real good guys. - Underneath.
4043	4047	- They couldn't be as dumb as they look. - Yes, they could.
4047	4049	They're just goons.
4050	4052	Johnny doesn't care for fighting. He told me so.
4052	4055	That's bullshit.
4062	4068	If we weren't so far below sea level, the radio reception here'd be much better.
4069	4071	Ooh, I'm getting tipsy!
4071	4074	I've been shitfaced for the past week.
4074	4076	I only drink in the afternoon.
4077	4081	Or before a game. Or when Johnny's away.
4081	4084	Me too.
4084	4086	If I'm not tight, I can't stand it.
4086	4088	That's terrible.
4093	4095	It's sad
4095	4096	So sad
4097	4100	It's a sad, sad situation
4100	4105	And it's getting more and more absurd
4108	4110	It's sad
4110	4111	So sad
4112	4115	Why can't we talk it over?.
4116	4118	Oh, it seems to me
4119	4123	That sorry seems to be the hardest word
4163	4166	- How you doin', Lil? - Hey, Johnny.
4176	4178	Hey, Lil?
4179	4181	Lil!
4187	4190	Hiya. Let's go someplace. You know the Aces?
4190	4192	- Bully! - Let's start something.
4192	4195	- Get the fuck out. I'm going home. - Oh, yeah?
4196	4198	Where's Braden going?
4204	4207	I got a better idea. Let's die in bed.
4207	4209	- You're nuts. - Jeez.
4210	4213	You really married a weirdo. He don't run with the traffic.
4213	4216	- Speakin' of weirdos. - Me? I'm normal.
4216	4218	Yeah? Well, then, normal is fucked.
4219	4222	How come you talk dirty?
4223	4226	Cos my family has money.
4227	4229	Leave him.
4231	4233	My wife left me. I was drivin' her crazy.
4234	4237	All she could do was drink and cry, like you.
4240	4244	Every time she sees me, it drives me nuts, cos I know she's askin' herself
4244	4247	"How did I get mixed up with a bum like him?"
4247	4249	- Good question. - Oh, yeah?
4250	4253	Next year you'll ask yourself the same question about Braden.
4253	4255	He treats you like shit.
4258	4263	He told me you only paid attention to me to make him crazy, so that he'd fight.
4263	4266	Yeah. That's part of it.
4267	4270	But mainly it's cos I think you're a champ.
4270	4272	Only you gotta stop killin' yourself.
4283	4285	My place. Hm. That's a coincidence.
4286	4288	- Get out! - Hey.
4289	4294	You gotta roll with it, kid. Use your imagination. That's what I've been doing.
4294	4296	I can get you straight.
4297	4298	Beat it.
4301	4303	Well, I'll see you later.
4321	4323	I'm proud of you. They're talkin' about you in the streets.
4324	4327	- Want a White Avenger?. - No. Gimme a cup of coffee.
4328	4332	- That was a nice tribute to the guys. - I tried to capture the spirit of the thing.
4332	4335	This is Dickie Dunn. He wrote the article on you.
4335	4339	Hi, guys. Nice to meet you. I was tryin' to capture the spirit of the thing.
4342	4344	Hi, guys.
4350	4353	See the game tonight, compliments of the Chiefs.
4353	4355	- Gee, thanks, Reggie. - Hey! Free tickets!
4356	4359	- Sure! Spread 'em around, guys! - Hey, thanks.
4359	4361	Come to the game, compliments of the Chiefs.
4361	4366	- Thanks, Reggie. - You taught that guy a lesson last night.
4366	4370	- He was sensational. - I guess that was a big fight?
4370	4372	- Are you in pain? - No. It hurt like hell.
4372	4375	Oh, you poor thing.
4375	4380	Look, I'll make you a double dose of this stuff, and you won't feel anything.
4380	4381	Good.
4381	4383	What happened to you?
4383	4386	He got that in the fight last night.
4386	4389	That is a very deep cut.
4390	4395	Will you be at the game? If I see you in the stands, it make me feel better.
4405	4407	Hey, Killer! Get 'em tonight!
4409	4411	Fuckin' wearin' me out.
4431	4433	- Reggie. - Oh, hiya, honey! How are you?
4434	4439	- You look a thousand years old. - It was a long bus ride.
4439	4441	- Did you listen to the game? - Of course not.
4441	4443	We got a new attitude! It's bringin' success.
4443	4446	- Well, any fool can fight. - No, I swear to you.
4446	4451	The Chiefs will be sittin' pretty in Florida when this town is a stinkin' memory.
4453	4457	You see, I personally have been talkin' to the owner,
4457	4459	which is why I've been too busy to call you.
4459	4461	Every wakin' hour I'm on the phone with this guy...
4461	4464	Reggie, Reggie. I'm moving.
4464	4466	- What? - To Long lsland.
4466	4470	A gal who works in a shop there has a space open.
4470	4472	Business here is just dead.
4474	4476	Are you really goin'?
4476	4479	You know, we have to get divorced one of these days.
4480	4484	I mean, I could meet somebody, you could meet somebody, you know?
4484	4487	Yeah?
4487	4489	Well, don't look so sad.
4495	4498	It's gonna be a big one!
4498	4500	- See those guys? - Reggie, look. I'm late.
4501	4503	I'll write you when I get settled.
4505	4508	Hey. I'll try to call you before you go.
4516	4520	- It sucks! - No, son. It looks nice and sells hockey.
4520	4524	It ain't mean enough. Put some blood in there.
4524	4527	Show somebody gettin' hurt. A groin injury.
4527	4530	Put a fuckin' map of Florida in the background. Get some tits in!
4530	4532	Put a "For Sale" sign on the bottom.
4532	4536	I don't want any tits and I don't want any "For Sale" sign.
4543	4545	Jesus.
4545	4549	Remember that great Peterborough game in... '68?
4549	4552	Yeah. What about it?
4552	4555	Jacky St Pierre's wife left him.
4555	4559	My God, it was snowing like hell before we even got to the motel.
4559	4563	- Yeah. - Jacky had a whole keg sent in.
4563	4567	Poor Jacky. He had a future. I told him to watch that drunk drivin'.
4567	4571	God, Joe, did we ever get shitfaced!
4571	4575	And Jacky told everybody he was gonna get Jill back even if he had to beg her.
4575	4579	- I told him not to do that. - Oh, I think he shoulda.
4579	4581	She was a dynamite broad.
4583	4585	- God, did we get shitfaced. - I liked Jacky.
4586	4589	- Yeah. He could've been great. - Yeah.
4592	4594	And remember I went up to your room afterwards
4594	4597	and you were dressed in chick's clothes?
4598	4601	Yeah, you had on this black bra with tassels.
4602	4607	You were dancing in front of a mirror with this kinda zebra-skin jockstrap.
4607	4610	Remember how I screamed at you when you started comin' on to me
4610	4613	and I just said "Jesus, stop it, Joe. I'm ashamed of you."
4613	4615	Damn you.
4615	4618	I wanted to tell you that I forgot the whole thing.
4618	4621	Years have passed. Now I'm sexually liberated.
4621	4624	I don't care who's a fag no more. I mean, who cares?
4624	4627	It's natural. It's all around us.
4629	4631	Who's the owner, Joe?
4633	4637	He's probably calling Florida. See how the sale is going.
4637	4640	I was in Florida once, on a Southern tour,
4640	4644	where I met this little redhead who was an underwater specialist.
4645	4651	The first thing she says to me was "Come on out by the pool."
4651	4656	So I went out, and she comes leaping out with this banner,
4656	4659	wearing nothing but this little see-through wet suit.
4661	4664	- Hey, Reg, I want a chair by the pool. - I want some snatch by the pool.
4664	4666	- Reg, you want a Coke? - No, I can't.
4666	4671	I'm tapin' an interview at the station. They're playin' it at four. Don't miss it.
4671	4675	That was some road trip. Six straight wins and a whole new rash of penalty minutes.
4676	4678	Well, we got a whole new attitude.
4678	4681	What about the Hanson brothers? They're not just bullies?
4681	4684	Just bullies? They scare the bejesus outta everybody!
4684	4687	- Deliberately? - Well...
4688	4693	I'd like the folks to come down and watch us cream them punks from Syracuse.
4693	4696	Anything new on the sale of the Chiefs?
4696	4701	I think the negotiations are... you know, goin' pretty good.
4701	4703	I have a personal announcement, though.
4703	4706	I am placing a personal bounty on the head of Tim McCracken.
4707	4710	He's the coach and chief punk on that Syracuse team.
4710	4712	- A bounty? - Yeah.
4713	4717	A hundred bucks of my own money for the first of my men that nails that creep.
4718	4720	That's eight o'clock at the War Memorial,
4721	4724	the Syracuse and the all-new Charlestown Chiefs.
4724	4727	- Thanks, Reg. - Not to worry, kid.
4727	4731	I'm placing a personal bounty on the head ofTim McCracken.
4731	4734	He's the coach and chiefpunk on that Syracuse team.
4734	4736	- A bounty? - Yeah.
4737	4740	A hundred bucks ofmy own money for the first ofmy men that...
4780	4782	- Yeah? - Are you nuts?
4782	4784	- Bullshit! - A bounty!
4785	4788	- We could all land in the clinker for this. - Oh, big deal, Joe.
4788	4791	You can't put a bounty on a man's head!
4791	4793	I just did.
4810	4812	- Yeah? - Reg? It's Killer.
4812	4815	- Oh. Hi, Killer. - I want that $100.
4815	4818	Well, you gotta earn it, Killer.
4818	4821	- My attitude's right. - Uh-huh. OK, kid.
4840	4843	In-fucking-credible.
4843	4845	Who is it?
4848	4850	Yeah?
4854	4857	- Hi. - Hi.
4857	4859	- What's up?
4860	4861	Jesus.
4862	4864	Come on in.
4864	4868	- Well, I did it. - You bet you did. You did, you bet.
4870	4873	The wedding presents my side gave. 50-50, right?
4873	4875	Can you get my clothes?
4875	4878	Sure.
4878	4880	Jesus, did you write him a note?
4881	4883	Do you think I should have?
4883	4885	I don't know.
4885	4887	He's sure gonna think the worst.
4891	4894	- Hey, Lily, we're gonna have a ball. - We are?
4895	4898	Except right now I gotta take a nap.
4898	4902	I mean, I put a bounty on this guy's head. If I don't get some shuteye...
4905	4909	If I don't get some shuteye, I'll get murdered out there on the ice.
4909	4914	Otherwise I would've given you a night on the town. We could've gone to the Aces.
4914	4916	She won't mind. She's great to sleep with.
4916	4918	Ned sleeps with her before every game.
4919	4921	Her breathing makes him feel more secure.
4921	4923	Listen, Reg, I'm gonna get a grip on myself.
4923	4927	I'm gonna start using my imagination, go with the traffic.
4927	4930	I've been going about this all wrong. I probably am terrific.
4930	4932	You want some spaghetti?
4933	4935	Reg?
4951	4955	Run the siren. Run the goddamn siren. I'm payin' for it.
4955	4957	Let 'em know there's gonna be blood in there.
4957	4960	I can circle, but it's gonna cost you more.
4960	4962	Oh, for Christ's sake.
4963	4965	- There.
4997	5000	Don't ever play "Lady of Spain" again!
5002	5003	Jesus Christ.
5015	5020	- Hey, McCracken. - Dunlop, you suck cock.
5020	5022	All I can get.
5036	5040	$100 bounty on the head of famed Syracuse stick man Tim McCracken.
5041	5045	McCracken, also known as Dr Hook for his scalpel-like prowess with the stick,
5045	5049	has been known to carve a man's eye out with a flick of the wrist.
5051	5053	There's a carnival-like atmosphere here.
5053	5059	The crowd is gathered and, well, you can feel it, there's an air of expectancy...
5061	5065	Syracuse skating out now. We're looking forward to a real contest.
5065	5068	We're ready to face off in the middle circle. The referee is ready.
5069	5071	The linesmen for tonight...
5081	5084	Go, Chiefs, go! Go, Chiefs, go!
5091	5093	$100 says you're gonna crack my skull.
5093	5096	- I wouldn't crack your knuckles for $100. - So he's bluffin'.
5096	5101	Somebody's gonna kill you, you dumb son of a bitch, but it's not gonna be me.
5130	5131	Good pass!
5134	5136	Go on, man! Hit him!
5136	5139	What's the matter with you? You're a Chief!
5139	5140	- Come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5140	5142	Fight back!
5155	5157	You son of a bitch! Get over here!
5158	5161	- Chickenshit yellow-belly. - I scored, you fucking has-been.
5161	5165	They don't want you to score goals. They want blood. They're booin' you.
5166	5168	Go get him, Killer!
5171	5173	Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on!
5175	5177	- Come on, Killer! - We win cos I score goals.
5178	5180	Oh, kiss my ass. We win cos I make 'em crazy.
5185	5187	- Nail him! - You don't make me crazy.
5187	5190	I will, cos you're benched.
5190	5193	You want ice time, come and tell me when you wanna play it my way.
5193	5197	- You're the biggest pussy in the league. - I like pussy.
5197	5200	Oh, yeah? Well, that's not what I hear from your wife. I hear...
5213	5216	Go get him, Killer!
5232	5235	Real old-fashioned guts, for Dave "Killer" Carlson
5235	5238	to jump into that fight with Tim "Dr Hook" McCracken.
5238	5240	Ned Braden's come into the booth. Sit down.
5240	5243	I noticed a slight discussion with Reg Dunlop.
5243	5245	What are you doing? You been benched?
5245	5247	Yes, a real first in my career. I've been benched.
5248	5250	- Why is that? - I won't fight.
5250	5254	- Well, you could play if you fought. - Let's just say I'm chickenshit.
5254	5259	Ned, why would someone with your background still be playing hockey?
5259	5261	- I hate my father. - You do?
5261	5263	- And I was having problems at home. - You are?
5263	5267	I just said I was. Primarily sexual problems. I'm very perverse.
5267	5270	- Holy shit! - I skate to get away from my wife!
5270	5273	- This is Jim Carr... - We fight. She wants me to quit hockey.
5277	5282	As you may have noticed, she's the only good-looking piece of ass in Charlestown!
5282	5285	She also has a drinking problem, and I have no idea where she is.
5285	5288	- Gimme that damn mike! - Why do you wear that rug?
5289	5291	It's just sensationally ugly.
5291	5294	You're going bald. Can't you face up to that?
5294	5296	Well, at least I'm not chickenshit like you!
5296	5298	What you're hearing is the truth!
5298	5300	Jim Carr got angry...
5302	5305	Joe McGrath here. The boys like to horse around.
5305	5307	- Chickenshit bastard! - Sod off, old fart!
5307	5311	- I may be bald, but I'm not chickenshit. - I wanna talk about violence.
5311	5315	- Chick, chick, chick! - Gimme that!
5315	5317	Son! Son!
5321	5323	Take my guitar
5324	5326	Forboard and room
5327	5329	- Hey, Billy!
5331	5335	Well, you're gonna be set, Lily. Taking your destiny by the throat.
5335	5337	You're in the driver's seat.
5338	5341	You're not having second thoughts about this, are you?
5341	5344	Sometimes I think I get it. Sometimes I think it's horseshit.
5344	5348	Well, to doubt is human. You stick with Reg. I'm on a roll.
5349	5354	- Bye, Francine. Come back and see us. - I will. Thank you, Mrs Vincent.
5357	5359	You're gonna need another 10 or 15 minutes.
5364	5366	- Hiya. - Hi.
5366	5369	This is Lily Braden, Ned Braden's wife.
5369	5372	Well, actually she's... she's on waivers.
5373	5376	Listen, she's in the market for a perm and I said to her
5376	5379	"Hey, there's no one better than old Francine."
5379	5382	- Well, I don't think... - For the works. I'm buyin'.
5382	5385	- I'll pay you back tomorrow. - No, that's not the problem.
5385	5387	You see, the problem is...
5389	5391	I never laid a hand on her. It was just a kid.
5391	5394	Listen, it's a pathetic story. It's pathetic.
5395	5396	You look terrific.
5400	5402	Be careful, girls.
5407	5410	- There's TVRadio Mirror, Modern Screen. - You were married to him?
5411	5413	For about a hundred years. It's all over.
5414	5417	He's completely off his rocker.
5417	5420	- I left my husband, too. - Really?
5420	5423	I'm only halfway out the revolving door, know what I mean?
5423	5428	Oh, it's lousy at first. You think you're dying. But then it's fabulous.
5428	5431	- I mean, you become a new woman. - Yeah.
5431	5435	You know, Reggie told me you've gotten terrific since you left him.
5436	5438	He said that?
5441	5444	Well, you know what you have to do for yourself?
5444	5446	You have to get out there and circulate.
5446	5451	I mean, you just can't sink into it. You have to get out there on the firing line.
5451	5453	- Oh, my God. - No, no, no, no, no.
5453	5455	Really. It's not bad. Look.
5456	5462	If you did your cheekbones better, you could look like Cher.
5463	5465	Huh?
5506	5509	- Amy, take this in the house. - Hello there.
5510	5514	Hiya. I'm Reg Dunlop. The Chiefs? I came to see your husband.
5514	5517	Oh, yes? I'm Anita McCambridge. How do you do?
5517	5519	- Hi. - You think you can help with these?
5520	5522	- Uh, yeah. - Mom, I'm late, I gotta go.
5522	5528	Michael, stay in the yard, put your jacket on and carry one of these in first.
5528	5530	Where's your husband?
5530	5533	He's in puppy heaven.
5536	5538	I own the Chiefs.
5540	5542	This way.
5552	5555	- What can I get you to drink? - Canadian Club and water.
5558	5560	- Nice place you've got here. - Thanks.
5562	5565	To tell the truth, Mrs McCambridge, the reason...
5565	5567	Anita.
5570	5572	OK, Anita.
5572	5577	Uh... you know, we all read about the possibility of a sale in Florida,
5577	5581	and the guys are getting anxious to find out what's going on.
5581	5584	- Mm-hm. - I guess I'm their representative.
5587	5591	- We've been doin' real good. - My accountant is certainly pleased.
5591	5592	Oh. Uh...
5593	5595	How is the sale goin'?
5596	5598	Fine.
5599	5602	- Oh. Good. - You think you're gonna like Florida?
5603	5605	Yeah.
5610	5612	- Oh, you are very clever. - What?
5612	5616	It's been so much fun, waiting to see what you're gonna do next.
5617	5621	The articles in the paper are very funny, that sports writer?
5621	5624	- Dickie Dunn? - You've certainly got his number.
5624	5630	The radio interviews are fantastic, and the Hanson brothers? Oh, my God!
5630	5632	Well, attendance has quadrupled.
5632	5635	Yes. I am in the black for the first time in four years.
5635	5640	- Hey, that's great. - I guess I owe that to you. Thank you.
5640	5642	You're welcome. So, you can sell us real easy, then?
5643	5647	- I could probably get some interest. - Oh, boy. That's great!
5647	5649	Oh, that's just great, Anita!
5649	5653	You know, for five months now, I've been tryin' to prove to you,
5653	5656	without ever really knowing who you were, that you were wrong,
5657	5660	and that we could get somebody interested in the Chiefs.
5661	5663	We could sew that thing up tonight, you know.
5663	5667	- We oughta cream those guys! - That's terrific.
5667	5672	But I couldn't make enough of a profit to have a sale be worthwhile.
5673	5677	My accountant tells me I'm better off folding the team, taking a tax loss.
5680	5683	You mean, you could sell us but you won't?
5683	5685	I could probably sell you.
5686	5688	But I can't.
5692	5694	Oh.
5695	5697	You know...
5697	5699	We're human beings, you know.
5702	5707	I have to confess that I've never let the children watch a hockey game.
5707	5711	I have a theory that children imitate what they see on a TV screen.
5712	5714	They see violence, they'll become violent.
5714	5718	They see someone stick up a bank, they'll stick up a bank.
5718	5720	Heroin. You name it.
5721	5724	- You're fucked. - What?
5724	5726	You are totally fucked.
5727	5730	You're garbage for letting us all go down the drain.
5730	5734	- Are you serious? - You could sell us. We're hot.
5734	5736	People go nuts for us. You could find a buyer.
5736	5739	I don't think you understand finance.
5748	5752	Your son looks like a fag to me. You'd better get married again,
5752	5755	cos he'll have somebody's cock in his mouth before you know it.
5755	5758	How dare you! How dare you!
5760	5765	Our listeners'll be surprised to learn that you're a soft-spoken young man, Killer.
5765	5766	Yes, I am.
5766	5769	I was watching some kids play hockey the other day,
5769	5771	five- and six-year-olds, little mites.
5772	5774	One kid said "I'm Killer Carlson."
5774	5777	He picked up his little stick, and he creamed that other kid.
5777	5779	How do you feel about that, Dave?
5779	5783	Well, Jim, the way I see it is, the kid probably would've done it anyway.
5783	5785	Bad upbringing in the home.
5785	5788	- That's very interesting. - Can I be serious for a minute?
5788	5790	By all means.
5790	5793	I'djust like to say that, no matterhow the game turns out tonight,
5793	5797	I owe all that I am to our coach, Reg Dunlop.
5797	5801	He's had the greatest influence on me, aside ofcourse from the Swami Baha,
5802	5805	whose positive-thinking records have been a tremendous help.
5805	5807	- Positive-thinking records? - Yeah.
5808	5811	You can get 'em in any religious record store.
5811	5814	And I know that thousands of people in Charlestown have lost their jobs,
5814	5817	you know, with the mill closing and all.
5817	5820	I see 'em walking around the streets depressed all the time.
5820	5823	Well, I just wanna say to all you unemployed folks out there,
5823	5826	you can get a new lease on life with these records.
5826	5829	Nothing'll botheryou any more.
5829	5832	You can go and clobber the next guy in yourbusiness life.
5832	5834	- That's very inspirational, Dave. - Thanks.
5834	5838	- Take care ofyourself. - Yeah. We're gonna win tonight...
5838	5840	Jesus Christ. What a fuckin' nightmare.
5875	5877	Braden!
5881	5883	Ned!
5884	5886	Hey!
5898	5900	Kid?
5903	5905	Hey, come on back!
5905	5910	You don't have to fight if you don't wanna. You can do whatever you wanna do.
5914	5917	You know, I've had it with the show business crap, too.
5918	5921	I don't know what hit me! I'm drivin' up here, and I say to myself
5921	5923	"Who cares about Florida?"
5923	5927	Screw the sale. It's probably a bunch of crap anyway.
5929	5931	No, that's bullshit.
5931	5933	Hey?
5934	5937	The team's history, kid. There ain't no next year.
5937	5941	I'm tits-up after this game no matter what happens.
5943	5945	But I'll tell you one thing.
5946	5949	We're gonna win that fuckin' championship tonight.
5949	5952	But we're gonna win it fair and square.
5952	5955	Old-time hockey, none of this wrestling shit.
5956	5959	You know? What the hell? It's my last game.
5959	5962	I'm gonna go out with style! Play it straight!
5965	5967	I'd like to have you there with me.
5977	5981	Oh, uh... you know, Lily's been staying at my place.
5981	5983	She's a terrific gal.
5987	5989	We've been havin' a hell of a time.
6003	6005	Reg! Hey, Reg!
6008	6010	- What? - Want me to run in with stretchers?
6010	6013	Get outta here, you goddamn parasite.
6017	6022	This is Jim Carr. Jeff Hanson, I just can't tell you the pleasure you've given us.
6022	6025	I'd like to ask one question. Win, lose or draw,
6025	6027	this is the Chiefs' last game before you leave.
6028	6032	- Anything you want to say to Flood City? - What do you mean, Flood City?
6032	6035	Never mind, Jeff. I guess that's before your time.
6035	6037	Reg Dunlop! How about a statement?
6037	6040	Good game, fella. Good luck to you tonight.
6040	6042	Reg Dunlop has just asked us to come back...
6042	6045	Girls! Outta here!
6065	6067	No hittin'.
6077	6081	The Chiefs are history, guys. There ain't no Florida deal.
6081	6084	Come on, Reg. What are you talkin' about?
6085	6089	I just made that shit up. We're deader than this stinkin' town is.
6090	6091	Dead history!
6092	6095	I conned you guys. I just lied to you.
6100	6104	We were never anything but a rich broad's tax write-off.
6104	6106	It made no difference whether we won or lost.
6106	6108	- Nail 'em! - Kill 'em!
6109	6113	You know, we ain't hockey players. We've been clowns.
6113	6117	We've been goons! We're the freaks in a fuckin' sideshow.
6117	6122	We're nothing but a bunch of criminals. We oughta be in jail, that's all there is.
6122	6126	- I'm ashamed. - Not you, Coach?
6126	6129	Yeah. Really ashamed of myself.
6133	6135	See, Ned was right.
6136	6139	Violence is killin' this sport. It's draggin' it through the mud.
6139	6144	If things keep up the way they are, hockey players'll be nothing but actors, punks.
6146	6148	Well, I'm not playin' my last game that way.
6148	6150	- Last game? - Yeah.
6151	6154	It's my last game, and I wanna play it straight.
6154	6157	No more "Nail 'em." No more "Fuck with 'em." That's finished.
6157	6161	I wanna win that championship tonight, but I wanna win it clean.
6161	6165	Old-time hockey, like when I got started, you know?
6166	6171	Jeez. Toe Blake, Dit Clapper, Eddie Shore, those guys were the greats.
6172	6175	I don't know what to say. Christ, it's up to you.
6187	6191	- Reg is our coach. - Yeah, sure. Old-time hockey!
6191	6193	- Like Eddie Shore. - Yeah.
6194	6196	Coach, our line starts?
6197	6199	- Sure. - Yeah!
6199	6203	We got a game to win. Everybody on the ice. Come on, guys.
6207	6209	Evening, boys.
6209	6213	Wimpy, how are ya? Crash, how are you? Scotty.
6213	6215	Better than Philadelphia this time!
6216	6219	You're gonna eyeball the new Charlestown Chiefs.
6219	6223	Well, ladies and gentlemen, this has all the earmarks of a hockey classic.
6223	6228	The championship confrontation between the Syracuse Bulldogs... Here they come!
6229	6234	The rags-to-riches, Cinderella contenders of the Federal League, the Chiefs!
6249	6253	Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!
6254	6259	Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!
6259	6262	Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!
6276	6278	I can't explain this delay.
6279	6281	I don't know why Syracuse elected to miss the warm-up.
6281	6284	The Chiefs have already skated over to their bench.
6285	6289	Well, it just might be that Syracuse is afraid to come out and face the Chiefs.
6289	6291	Oh, thanks, Bill.
6293	6295	Good heavens.
6295	6297	I've just been handed the Syracuse roster,
6298	6302	and it appears the Syracuse Bulldog management is just real thirsty
6302	6304	for a big, grudge-match type victory here tonight.
6304	6308	They've brought back, just for this one contest, some colourful...
6308	6312	Oh, and here they come now, led by someone we all know very well,
6312	6314	Tim "Dr Hook" McCracken!
6316	6320	And here's a name from the past. Ross "Mad Dog" Madison!
6320	6323	Ross, as you know, never travels anywhere
6323	6327	without his longtime friend and attorney, Sam "Small Print" Lyman!
6327	6333	Here's one for nostalgia fans! Clarence "Screaming Buffalo" Swamptown!
6333	6336	I'll never forget an interview I did with him years ago,
6336	6340	when Buffalo revealed he liked to call his hockey stick "The Big Tomahawk".
6340	6343	He usually refers to opposing players as "The Little Scalps".
6343	6346	I thought he'd been suspended for ever.
6347	6349	Andre "Poodle" Lussier, defence.
6349	6353	Andre, of course, has been living in semi-seclusion in Northern Quebec
6353	6357	ever since the unfortunate Denny Pratt tragedy.
6357	6358	Not Poodle!
6358	6362	And from Mile Forty, Saskatchewan, where he now runs a doughnut shop,
6362	6366	number 15, former penalty-minute record holder of the Federal League
6367	6371	for the years 1960 to 1968 inclusive, Gilmore Tuttle!
6375	6377	Oh, gee. Hold the phone.
6377	6379	This is an unscheduled surprise.
6382	6383	It's him.
6383	6387	This young man has had a very trying rookie season,
6387	6391	what with the litigation, the notoriety, his subsequent deportation to Canada,
6391	6394	and that country's refusal to accept him.
6394	6397	That's more than most 21-year-olds could handle.
6397	6400	- Ogil-terp. - Ogie Ogilthorpe!
6417	6419	Hi, Ogie.
6420	6423	Buy you a soda after the game?
6425	6427	Hi. You know Toe Blake?
6428	6430	No?
6431	6433	We'll straighten you out, you little prick.
6440	6442	How.
6442	6445	- They don't call me Dr Hook for nothing. - How you doin'?
6446	6450	All right, now. No high-sticking. No tripping. No slashing.
6450	6453	Major surgery. Open-heart.
6453	6456	- I'm waitin' for quiet. - Yeah, you'll have quiet.
6462	6464	Give 'em hell!
6471	6473	Give 'em the old-time hockey!
6477	6479	- Good crowd. - Shirley!
6479	6482	- Teamwork! Teamwork! Teamwork! - Eddie Shore!
6482	6485	Come on! Get up! Get up!
6485	6489	One with the universe. One with the universe. Nothing matters.
6489	6494	This reporter is stunned! The Charlestown Chiefs are not fighting back!
6505	6507	Keep the guys off me!
6513	6514	You fuckin' moron!
6515	6518	The Chiefs' performance has to be a bitter disappointment
6518	6522	to these 4,000-odd Charlestown fans who have packed this War Memorial,
6522	6526	paying good money to witness this... this fiasco.
6526	6528	Get Ogie!
6528	6530	Move away, Wanchuk! You're screening me.
6531	6533	You're screening me! Move away!
6533	6536	Give him some of that back!
6536	6539	Don't let him push you like that!
6551	6552	Come on!
6556	6558	- Get up! - Get off your ass!
6558	6560	I don't know what's wrong.
6563	6566	You bums! You're no damn good!
6573	6576	Get up off your ass!
6593	6596	- OK. Let's get some speed out there. - Cement-heads.
6596	6599	Keep your eyes open. Better passing.
6599	6602	Better passing. We got a big period coming up out there.
6602	6607	Try to come back with the wingers, maybe. Tonight's the night.
6607	6610	- Who wants ice packs here? - Charlie, over here!
6612	6616	We need some more coordination out there.
6616	6620	- Keep your eyes open. Better passing.
6623	6626	I'm comin'! I'm comin'!
6626	6628	- All right. All right. - Mother of God.
6629	6631	I want a big rally this period. A big rally.
6633	6635	- We're losin'! - Teamwork, guys. More teamwork.
6635	6638	They're buryin' us alive!
6638	6640	- Eddie Shore? - Oh, piss on Eddie Shore.
6640	6643	- Old-time hockey? - Piss on old-time hockey!
6643	6646	You're blowin' it! Boys.
6646	6651	Every scout in the NHL is out there tonight with contracts in their pocket,
6651	6655	and they're lookin' for talent, for winners!
6655	6658	Oh! All my years of publicity!
6658	6663	All the fashion shows, the radiothons, for nothing?
6663	6666	They come here tonight...
6666	6669	to scout the Chiefs!
6669	6672	The toughest team in the Federal League!
6673	6677	Not this bunch of...
6678	6680	pussies!
6694	6696	Scouts?
6713	6716	This is more like it. It just makes me feel real glad
6716	6720	to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again... to coin a phrase.
6723	6727	God, it's been a long time since this place saw my shadow.
6732	6736	- What am I doing here? - You look fabulous. Now, come on.
6745	6747	Oh, my God. I'd forgotten.
6753	6757	Everybody is just on their feet screaming "Kill! Kill! Kill!" This is hockey!
6760	6761	Let's go, Chiefs!
6786	6790	All right! Kill 'em!
6808	6811	They're pummelling each other! Wait a minute.
6811	6814	Ned Braden is skating out onto the centre of the ice. He...
6821	6824	He's not fighting, no. He's...
6832	6836	Ned Braden is starting to take off articles of his uniform!
6938	6940	Way to go, Ned. Way to go.
6940	6945	I don't want any youngsters to get the idea that this is the way to play hockey.
6949	6951	Stop that! That's disgusting!
6956	6959	- I protest! - Protest? Protest what?
6959	6964	I'm glad Mrs Carr isn't here tonight, because this is a lascivious display!
6967	6969	Take it off!
6970	6973	- Make him stop or we go! - Get your paws off me, Scarface!
6973	6976	Stop him! This is a serious game, not a freak show!
6976	6980	What do you mean, a serious game? What are you talking about? This is hockey!
6981	6985	- You're afraid of these goons, aren't you? - Watch out, punk!
6987	6991	- Get that pervert off the ice! - Hands off me, or you forfeit the game.
6991	6993	Forfeit, my ass! Look at that!
6995	6998	All right. That's it. That's the game.
6998	7002	- You lose. - What are you talking about, lose?
7002	7006	All right, come on, dummy, you won the game. Come on, pick up your trophy.
7011	7013	Here ya go, ya bum.
7022	7026	The Chiefs have won the championship of the Federal League!
7027	7029	He's gonna catch his death out there.
7051	7053	I said some bad things about the boy,
7053	7056	but we can explain that to the exuberance and excitement of youth,
7057	7059	because he's certainly changed his ways now.
7063	7065	My boy!
7094	7097	- Hi, Francine! - Francine!
7099	7101	Come on, honey! You got all the room in the world.
7101	7103	You ain't gonna hit anything. Come on!
7107	7111	- I got good news! - Honey, I'm paying by the hour for this.
7111	7114	The Minnesota Night Hawks. I'm coaching. The Big Apple!
7114	7120	- Somebody's pulling a practical joke. - No! I got a contract back there in the car.
7120	7123	Hey, the Chiefs are history, but the minute I get up to Minnesota,
7123	7126	I'm gonna bring my guys up there.
7126	7131	I mean, we're a solid act, honey. We're starting out with something big.
7131	7133	- Oh, Jesus! - What?
7134	7136	You don't have my number.
7137	7140	If you wanna get in touch with me, just do it through the team.
7140	7143	The Minnesota Night Hawks, remember? OK?
7143	7145	You could need some money or something, or...
7145	7149	Well, maybe things just won't work out the way you expect.
7149	7152	Jeez, we got a lot of years between us, Francine.
7152	7154	- Some hard miles, you know? - I know.
7154	7158	- Oh, shut up, you goddamn meathead!
7158	7161	- Honey, I gotta go. - You gotta go.
7161	7165	Listen, if things don't work out, you can get in touch with me in Minneapolis.
7165	7168	- Bye, Reggie. - I could make a goddamn fortune.
7191	7194	- Is she comin' to Minnesota? - For sure!
